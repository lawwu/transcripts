[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.560]   - So it's my great pleasure to,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.480]   I should start by saying what an honor it is
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.080]   to have an opportunity to participate in this conference.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.040]   I've long admired the Bogleheads.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.040]   I know you mainly from the discussion board.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.320]   I'm a dilettante there.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760]   I've not earned my stripes on Bogleheads discussion boards
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240]   to be a regular contributor, but all the same,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.120]   I've learned so much from all of you
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.400]   and it's an honor to be a part of this morning's proceedings
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   and congratulations on what sounds like
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.520]   has been a very, very successful conference.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.160]   So I wanted to tell you a little bit about Nick.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.880]   I think he probably doesn't need any introduction
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880]   to many of you, very, very successful author, blogger,
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.080]   and operator in his own right.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.840]   But all the same, it could be helpful to have a thumbnail.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.000]   So I thought we would start with that and I'll bring Nick up
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and he and I'll have a chat for 30, 35 minutes
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.560]   and then we'll open things up to you all
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.640]   to make sure that you have an opportunity
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.120]   to ask questions of him, same way I do.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.400]   But for those of you who aren't familiar with Nick,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.440]   Nick is Chief Operating Officer
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.840]   for Ritholes Wealth Management,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.160]   which Nick, as you know, is a registered investment advisor,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.120]   which he joined in 2018.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.720]   He's also the author of a best-selling book.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   I think, Nick, you said was it 35,000 copies and counting,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.440]   which is a very, very significant accomplishment
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.120]   and deservedly so, it's a fantastic book.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.800]   If you haven't read it, I should say,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.760]   one that'll be a focus of our conversation in a moment.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.360]   In addition to the book, Nick is the author
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.400]   of "Dollars and Data," which is a blog
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   that explores the conversion of data in personal finance.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.760]   He's a graduate of Stanford University
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.120]   with a degree in economics.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360]   I'm very pleased to welcome him to the stage today.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360]   So, Nick, welcome.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.480]   - Okay, thank you, everyone, for having me.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   Thanks for your time, and Christine,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.040]   thanks for the invite, appreciate that.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.720]   - So I think we'll start at an obvious place,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.040]   which is the book.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   Maybe you can, the title is "Just Keep Buying."
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   Maybe you can talk about the origin story for that,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.320]   because it's interesting.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800]   - Yeah, so there's a YouTuber named Casey Neistat,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   and he used to vlog out of New York,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.720]   and one day he uploaded this video called
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   "Three Words That Got Me to Three Million Subscribers,"
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120]   and the three words were "Just Keep Uploading,"
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.320]   and he had gotten this recommendation
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.600]   from another YouTuber and said just upload every day,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.320]   vlog every day, and you'll be successful,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.520]   and he is successful.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   He now has 12 million subscribers.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040]   He's been on the Academy Awards, all sorts of stuff.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   Anyways, I had seen that video,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.040]   and at the same time, right around that time,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.920]   I had started blogging in early 2017.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   I was very new to it.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   I was running all this analysis on US stock market returns,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.280]   and this is something that I learned at the time.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.520]   Many of you probably already know this,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   but it doesn't really matter when you buy,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.120]   like regardless of valuations, starting valuation,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.440]   P/E ratio, et cetera.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   All that matters is the holding period.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.760]   Over a 30-year period, all the returns converge,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.960]   regardless of the starting P/E, right?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   And so when I saw that, I said the real solution here
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   to build wealth is just to keep buying over time,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.400]   and that's kind of how it came about.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.040]   Fun little side fact, when I was coming up
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.280]   with the name for the book, a little context.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.920]   So every chapter in the book, I basically answer a question.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   How much should you save?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240]   How much of your raise do you need to save?
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.440]   Lifestyle creep, all sorts of stuff like that.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.160]   But when I was coming up with the book title,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   my publisher was like, "Why don't we call it
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.600]   "A Data Scientist Answers the 15 Biggest Questions
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.120]   "in Finance?" (audience laughing)
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.920]   And I said, "That's the worst title I've ever heard,"
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   so we went with Just Keep Buying instead.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.080]   - So we're gonna talk some more about the book,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.680]   particularly on the topics of saving and spending,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.400]   but before we did that, I think we'd be remiss
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.760]   if we didn't spend a little bit of time
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.880]   talking about the markets, inflation.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   And so at the time you published the book,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.360]   inflation was relatively benign.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.140]   Markets were flying high, risk was being rewarded.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.240]   Different story this year, obviously.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.840]   What would you say to those who might question
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.520]   whether they should just keep buying,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.940]   given their recent experience in the market?
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.000]   - I mean, it's only been, what, 10 1/2 months
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.040]   into this from the highs, so if you're giving up hope
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   at 10 1/2 months, then you're not truly
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.940]   a long-term investor.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.640]   I think I'm preaching to the choir in here.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   I mean, we've had decades where markets go nowhere.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.820]   You can think of 2000, 2009, you can think of the 1970s,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.700]   most of the 1930s, right?
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000]   So if you're giving up hope after 10 1/2 months,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760]   then maybe you need to reassess your risk profile
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.120]   amongst other things.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.500]   But the joke I like to say, it's not my joke,
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.600]   I stole it from Rap Capital, but he says,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.700]   yeah, the market's down, but the 100-year moving average
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.400]   is looking pretty good, and so that's what I,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.440]   you actually look at the data,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.040]   the 100-year real return in U.S. stocks,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.300]   if you look at it through September, is 7.1% real.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.240]   That's like with dividends, that's like insane.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.800]   And I don't expect that going forward.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.960]   If I had to assume a real rate of return
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.460]   across global markets, I would say 4%.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.760]   I hope we get that.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.800]   We obviously can't know,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.100]   but that's how I plan going forward.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.160]   - You wrote a piece in which you examine market performance
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.600]   following drawdowns of different severity.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.240]   What did you find, and how does that apply to now?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.720]   - Yeah, so when people like to talk about drawdowns,
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.760]   people like to say, okay, we're now in a dip of,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.680]   let's say, right now the market's down 24%.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.160]   The question is, are future returns higher
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   over the next one year, the next three years,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.200]   the next five years, given, conditional on being
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.320]   in a drawdown of some amount?
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.640]   And the answer is generally no.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.840]   Once you're in a 20% drawdown or a 30% drawdown,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   you go back to 1926, it doesn't really,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.600]   at least in US stocks, it doesn't really make a difference.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.480]   You're saying, oh, I'm down 20%.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.200]   The one-year returns don't really change.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.400]   You're down 30% when your returns don't really change.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   However, once you're down 40% or more,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   so the very extreme drawdowns,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.320]   then the returns start to shoot up.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.600]   So what's the logic behind that?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.980]   Why does it not make a difference?
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.200]   Because when you're down 20%,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.880]   you could go down another 20%,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.280]   and then another 20%, right?
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.640]   So you don't know what's to come.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.560]   So when you're down like a little bit,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.520]   there can be more pain ahead,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.160]   but once you're down a lot, once you're down 40, 50%,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.400]   most of the pain, most of the time has already happened,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.440]   right, and so that's just what we have in US stocks.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.080]   If we look in world stocks, it's a little bit different,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.440]   so, and the world data only goes back to like 1970,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.400]   MSCI World, ex-US, and so from 1970 through now,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.320]   roughly there is a little bit of a benefit
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.880]   once there's a dip, so like buying the dip
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.320]   or having, putting more in once the market declines
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.760]   by 30% or more, generally there's some benefit there,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.400]   but where we are now, I would say we're going down 24%,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.640]   there's no evidence that necessarily the pain's over yet,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.840]   so I wouldn't say, oh my gosh, back up the truck
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.440]   and buy everything, because we don't know that yet.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.920]   Now if the market was down 50%,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.600]   I would be making a very different argument,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.160]   so I think that's the context to think about drawdowns,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.080]   and so I don't really get excited about buying
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.720]   until there's a very large drawdown.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.960]   So I think the last time I even got excited at all
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.560]   was March 23rd, 2020, 'cause we were down 33%,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   which was like the most I've seen in my investing career, so.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.040]   - You also wrote a piece last year
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.960]   in which you tried to answer the question
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.520]   of how to invest when inflation is high.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.880]   Can you talk about what you found
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.440]   and maybe also update us on your thinking on that topic,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.560]   if it's changed any since?
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.520]   - Yeah, so if you look at, since the mid-1970s,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.800]   the asset class, the best performing asset classes
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.160]   in terms of real return,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.760]   the top three are U.S. stocks, U.S. REIT,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.720]   international stocks.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.480]   Like this is just broad asset classes
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.440]   that most of us can buy.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.760]   We're not talking private equity and things
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.280]   where I can't really get into for retail investors.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.520]   So those are the top three going back to like the mid-1970s.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.160]   If you actually then subset to the periods
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.560]   when inflation exceeds 4%, so that's not high,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.320]   but it's higher than most of history,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.040]   so you subset to those, the top three asset classes
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.440]   are U.S. REITs, international stocks, U.S. stocks,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.080]   the same set of assets.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.160]   And so my takeaway from this
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   is like owning income-producing risk assets
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.040]   like global stocks, real estate,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   other types of income-producing assets
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.320]   is the way to go regardless of the inflationary environment
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.640]   because yes, there's inflation that can happen,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.560]   but it's really tough to know
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.520]   when to get in and out of those strategies.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.480]   Like if we're thinking back like 1973,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.440]   U.S. market was down I think 21% in real terms.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.160]   The year after that, it was down 34%.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.800]   So we basically got cut in half within two years.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.640]   And right now, I think in real terms,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.600]   well, we just had 8% print and we're down 24.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.280]   So we're down about 32% real terms in the last year.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.760]   So that's almost like our 1974 again, right?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.080]   If you're thinking about the current environment.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.200]   So that doesn't mean the pain's over or anything,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.040]   but just thinking about that, like what happened in 1975,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.440]   there was a 28% real return on the upside.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.920]   So I'm not saying that's gonna happen now,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.520]   but once we get through that,
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.480]   the real returns start to happen later.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.600]   So.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.920]   - So at this point, I was gonna turn
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.600]   and talk a little bit about saving and spending.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.000]   In the book you state,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.360]   saving is for the poor, investing is for the rich,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.120]   and you provide a framework for determining
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   where you sit on that saving investing spectrum.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.920]   Can you walk through that for the audience?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.840]   - Yeah, so I think the best way to do this is with the story
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.480]   'cause it'll make more sense that way.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.840]   So when I was 23 years old and I was living in San Francisco,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   I just graduated, got my first job.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   I'd saved about $1,000 within a few months.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.080]   And I'm a true bogal head even from back in the day
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.400]   before I even knew what the bogal heads were.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   I had spreadsheets, I was projecting my net worth,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.840]   I was over analyzing my asset allocation.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.560]   I had $1,000 to my name, even with a 10% return,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.160]   which I, you know, let's assume 10% to make the math easy.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   That's $100.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.800]   At the same time, and I was making all these spreadsheets,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.240]   I was going out with my friends, going to dinner,
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.480]   buying rounds of shots, getting my Uber home.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.560]   Like I would blow my entire investment return in one night.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.680]   And I did it multiple times throughout that year.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.840]   So when I say savings for the poor,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.480]   investing for the rich, what I'm saying is like,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.000]   it didn't really matter what I did with my investments then.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.360]   I'm not saying you shouldn't invest
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.520]   when you don't have a lot of assets.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.800]   That's never my, I would never say that to anybody.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.240]   I'm just saying it doesn't really matter.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.960]   Tax loss harvesting doesn't matter when you have $1,000.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.560]   You know, your asset allocation doesn't matter.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.480]   Your rebalancing frequency doesn't matter.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.000]   Now, most of the people in this room
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.200]   have been accumulating for some time, so it does matter.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.360]   And so the question is, when does it start to matter more
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.800]   and how do you think about it?
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.160]   And so I have a framework I use
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.760]   called the Save-Invest Continuum.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.400]   And basically, every person in this room
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.280]   is on this continuum and you can figure out where you are
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.840]   just from two numbers in your life.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.040]   First number is, how much can you save in the next year?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.880]   Whatever that is.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.200]   Maybe you can save 10,000, maybe you can save 100,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   maybe you can save a million.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.360]   Whatever, that's your number.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.400]   This isn't a contest, by the way,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080]   so just privately keep these numbers.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.240]   The second number is how much can your investment portfolio
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   earn you in the next year?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.840]   So assume maybe 5%, 10% return, whatever.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.160]   Just take something, just an average return, right?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.880]   So let's say you have $100,000, 10% return,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.200]   that's 10 grand, right?
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.640]   So you have your first number, you have your second number.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.600]   The question is, which number is bigger?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.200]   And the bigger number is where you should
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   spend more of your focus.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   Now obviously, if they're both similar,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.800]   then you need to care about both.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.240]   So let me give you the example.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.760]   When I was 23, I probably could have saved
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.080]   five, 10 grand in a year.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.520]   My investments would return me $100, right?
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.720]   So you see the difference.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.840]   When I was 23, I should have been focusing on my income,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.240]   raising my income, saving that money
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.520]   to get the other number higher over time.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.120]   Now think of someone who's retired.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.440]   They can't save anything.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.040]   All of their focus is on their investments.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.280]   It's about tax loss harvesting.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.160]   It's about all the little, tiny details.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.920]   And so when you think about that framework,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.440]   you can use that throughout your life.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.400]   And so for most young people,
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.480]   they're gonna be focusing on income.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.600]   And I say, don't really worry about your investments.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.960]   But as you get older and as you start
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.000]   to accumulate more wealth,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.640]   you need to really focus on the investments.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.960]   And that's what I think the bulkheads do
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.240]   because you guys have been accumulating
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.520]   for so long at this point.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.560]   Which is also why it's funny we talk about this breakup,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.600]   and this is exactly how the conference is broken up.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   Like we had the accumulator room,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.720]   and then we had the retirement room,
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.200]   'cause there are different focuses, right?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.160]   And we talked about saving money in there.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.440]   I think, was it Chris, is that your name?
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.760]   Yeah, Chris had a great panel in there
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.640]   where he's talking about FIRE,
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.920]   and he was talking about spending money
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.160]   and income and all that, and that's for accumulators.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.920]   Whereas in here, we're talking about retirement
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   and a lot of little tax strategies and things like that.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.840]   So I think that's probably the defining idea of the book
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.360]   and how the whole book's even laid out.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.640]   - In the book, you also talk about
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   what you call the biggest lie in personal finance,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.160]   which is the notion that people can be rich
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.200]   if they cut spending.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.040]   Why do you think that's a big lie,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.120]   and what should people focus on instead?
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.800]   - So I've just looked at the data
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.080]   pretty religiously on this,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.140]   and there's a great paper called "Do the Rich Save More?"
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.840]   And they basically show that the highest correlation
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.200]   with savings rate is income,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.580]   and it seems pretty obvious to me.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.920]   Like, okay, obviously you have more income,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.440]   you have more savings rate.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.520]   Now, of course, it's very easy to say,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.680]   well, I know this person that has a high income
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.520]   and they don't save a lot,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.880]   and it's easy to find anecdotes.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.160]   And anecdotes are fine,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.040]   but over on average, that's not true, right?
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.320]   If you look at between that piece of that paper they put out
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.640]   and then there's a guy named Emmanuel Saez
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.480]   and Gabriel Zuckman,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.320]   they do a lot of great stuff on inequality
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   and wealth inequality.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.840]   They find that the higher your wealth is,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.800]   the higher your savings rate.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.560]   And this has been true since 1910.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.280]   They have data going all the way back to 1910.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.720]   They find higher savings rate
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.520]   is correlated with higher wealth.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.280]   Besides the 1930s, Great Depression,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.880]   apparently it's really tough to save money,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.340]   so besides then.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.020]   But yeah, I just think the data's pretty clear on that.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.880]   And I'm not saying you can't cut spending
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.800]   to save money and to build your wealth.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.080]   It's just a short-term solution.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   I think we need to be honest about this
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.260]   and we need to talk about income
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.740]   and how do we get people's incomes higher
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.400]   and how can individuals increase their income.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.640]   I think that's the main takeaway.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.680]   - Can you talk about the 2X rule
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.820]   and also whether splurging,
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.120]   the 2X rule is one of the concepts,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.400]   constructs that Nick writes about in the book,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   and also whether splurging should be thought of differently
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.940]   amid sharply rising prices
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.040]   or if the same basic framework applies
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.480]   irrespective of where inflation is.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.420]   - Yeah, so I think there's a lot.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.500]   I mean, a lot of people can't save money,
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.580]   but for those that can,
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.940]   I think there's a lot of spending guilt.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.940]   I think most people in this room
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.180]   are probably very good at saving
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.260]   and maybe we're not.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.660]   Because we're so good at one side
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.020]   to then flip in retirement
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.100]   and go to spend a lot of money, it's very difficult.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.380]   So I'm trying to come up with ways
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.500]   to get people to spend their money
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.820]   without feeling guilty about it.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.980]   And so if you're gonna splurge on something
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.040]   and for every person, a splurge is defined differently,
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.960]   I just said, if you're gonna spend $500 on a nice dinner,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.840]   save another 500 and invest that
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.480]   in income producing assets, S&P 500, whatever,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.880]   or donate that to a good cause.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.720]   There's different ways.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.080]   It's just tricks to try and get over the spending guilt.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.320]   If you don't have spending guilt, don't worry about it.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.880]   In terms of how do I feel differently now
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.720]   with rising prices?
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.060]   Well, if inflation's going up,
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.160]   that means an old splurge of $300,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.020]   maybe now a splurge is even cheaper now
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.400]   than it used to be relatively, right?
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.100]   So now it's like, oh, I used to just go,
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.700]   I'd say we'd go to the opera and it was 300 bucks
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.700]   I'd spend now, it costs $500 or whatever.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.060]   And so I think that's price levels change,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.160]   your level of splurge is gonna change, so.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.320]   - In the book, you also talk about the interplay
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.260]   between human capital and financial capital
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.580]   and the role each plays in amassing wealth
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.680]   and enjoying a secure retirement.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.380]   Do you think the personal and professional disruption
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.420]   of the pandemic raises questions
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.060]   about how reliably we can estimate
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.660]   our future capacity to earn
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.180]   and how we'd estimate human capital?
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.860]   - Yeah, I think this is a really tough question
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.980]   because we're all planners.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.620]   I mean, this is what you're all planning
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.700]   for our financial futures.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.460]   We're planning based on certain assumptions
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.620]   about our income and all these things,
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.900]   but stuff happens where we can't predict.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.560]   And unfortunately, the pandemic's one of those examples
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.940]   where if you were in a particular industry,
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.900]   you could have gotten hit very badly.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.020]   I was actually talking to Jim here about,
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.540]   he had a conference, the White Coat Investor Conference,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.620]   and that same week when they shut down
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.780]   the MBA and everything, he had a conference
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.020]   where a bunch of positions were coming
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.500]   and that he just got completely unlucky with that.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.460]   And that's just, if he said he had it the week before,
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.420]   it would have been perfect.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.340]   If it was a week later, he could have canceled everything.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.180]   That's a great example of something you cannot control.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.500]   And so unfortunately, it's really tough
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.500]   to predict future human capital, future market conditions.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.480]   At the same time, though,
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.240]   I think there's always a market opportunity.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   There's always opportunities for people,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   even when things look bad,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.560]   you just have to really kind of try
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.500]   and figure out what they are.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.640]   And so it can be tough, but you know,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.600]   I don't really have a great answer.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.700]   That's my best take on it.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.960]   - No, I think that's really helpful, actually.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.680]   I do wanna touch on personal finance.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.040]   We're gonna, I think, devote more of the morning
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.580]   to personal finance as a topic.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.780]   You write about it in the book quite compellingly.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.200]   Your book, it's not pro-debt,
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.860]   but it certainly isn't a polemic against borrowing
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.900]   to do things like reduce risk or attempt to amp up returns.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.500]   Now that interest rates have jumped,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.420]   would you caution more strongly against taking out debt,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.940]   even in the circumstances that you walk through in the book
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.960]   where you think a little bit
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.980]   could be acceptable and manageable?
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.740]   - This is always a marginal decision.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.020]   It's gonna be different for every person in this room.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.740]   So like, whether it makes sense to take out debt or not,
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.780]   I think it's a very personal decision.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.500]   So I don't really have a great answer for that either,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.000]   but I think at the end of the day, yeah,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.840]   you just have to figure out,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.080]   it's always relative to something, right?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.700]   'Cause everyone's like, oh, should I buy or rent?
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.300]   Well, it's relative to what's the rental rate,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   what's the mortgage rate.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.880]   All these things are relative to each other,
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.460]   and that system's always changing, right?
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.260]   So for us to say you should always buy
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.580]   or you should always rent,
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.060]   it's not really being intellectually honest
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.580]   how conditions are always changing.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.980]   And so I just want us to be more open to that idea.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.180]   - What's another piece of received personal finance wisdom
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.720]   that you think is off base?
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.260]   - Saving up cash to buy the dip.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.020]   I think that is the worst thing you can do.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.140]   I think there's a lot of people that,
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.820]   oh, I'm gonna hold a lot of cash
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.940]   and wait for the next big dip.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.280]   And the issue with that is it only works
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.640]   if you know a big dip's coming,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.660]   and it's gotta be a pretty big dip.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.460]   A smaller dip's not gonna really be profitable,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.780]   so it's really tough to know that in advance,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.700]   and I know it's very popular in the culture.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.460]   I don't think it's that popular with the vocal heads,
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.060]   so you guys are like, oh, I'm preaching to the choir here,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.620]   but I just think it's very misguided
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.460]   and people shouldn't be holding a ton of cash
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.640]   in anticipation of a dip.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.880]   Now, the converse to that is if by chance we're in a dip
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.060]   and you happen to have cash,
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.340]   let's say you sold your business,
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.540]   that's just how it turned out,
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.860]   and you happen to have a bunch of cash
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.140]   and we happen to be in a dip, then it's great.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.060]   But you shouldn't be waiting on the sidelines
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.900]   for that type of stuff,
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.340]   'cause generally the market does not reward that.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.460]   - You also devote a section of the book to housing,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.060]   and explore the buy versus rent question.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.460]   How does the sharp rise in both home prices
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.140]   and mortgage rates change the equation
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.100]   for prospective home buyers?
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.140]   It seems like affordability, for instance,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.060]   is a real problem now.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.140]   - Yeah, so I think most people use very simple heuristics
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.300]   with a lot of their financial life,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.860]   and so I think the housing heuristic is what's my payment,
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.660]   you know, what's my mortgage payment gonna be?
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.340]   So if rates go up and prices have not changed,
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.180]   obviously payments will go up, all else equal.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.220]   So I think I read somewhere that for payments
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.220]   to equilibrate with what they were a year ago,
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.580]   prices would have to drop like 40% or something,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.860]   which is a large amount,
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.900]   and so I don't think they will drop that much.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.020]   Maybe they will drop.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.780]   I don't know how much, obviously, is the question.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.940]   So if you're really just anchoring on payments,
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.020]   which is what most people do,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.460]   then yes, it is gonna be difficult right now for people.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.300]   - Yeah, a couple of good follows.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.940]   I don't know if you follow them too on housing right now.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.100]   Bill McBride at Calculated Risk,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.620]   and Colin Roach for What It's Worth.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.980]   They're both in, I think, probably, I suspect,
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.100]   in both our Twitter feeds,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.560]   but they do great work on housing,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.460]   if that's an area that you're keenly interested in
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.380]   for what it's worth.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.500]   Sticking with housing for a minute,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.540]   first-time homebuyers, do you think it's wise
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.360]   for them to hold off now, and if so,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.900]   what should they be monitoring, engaging,
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.380]   when the time's right to buy their first home?
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.700]   - I think this is more of a personal decision
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.140]   than a financial decision.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.900]   Of course, it is a financial decision for most people.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.900]   It's gonna be the biggest financial decision you ever make,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.220]   but how long can you hold off?
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.100]   Could rates go higher?
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.940]   Yes.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.760]   Could they come down?
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.600]   Yes.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.460]   It's really tough to know what's gonna happen,
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.540]   and you're basically asking me to predict the future,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.340]   which I obviously cannot do.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.100]   So I think, for the most part, I would say,
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.460]   if it's the right time for you to buy,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.380]   even though the market rates are high,
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.700]   so your payment's probably gonna be higher,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.220]   you may have to downsize a little,
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.140]   but if you think it's the time for you to have a home,
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.520]   then go for it.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.580]   - I wanted to shift and talk again
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.820]   about investing, if we can.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.940]   One of the arguments you make for investing
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.740]   is that it promotes saving for your future self.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.660]   I think that argument builds on research
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.620]   that folks like Hal Hirschfield have done in this area.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.460]   Talk about what that research found
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.420]   and why empathizing with one's future self
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.460]   can induce one to invest.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.220]   - Yeah, so they did these experiments
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.740]   where they basically, I don't know if you guys remember
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.400]   this FaceApp thing that was going around.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.240]   This is kind of where you took a picture of yourself,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.700]   and you can see yourself as an old person,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.460]   or as a woman, or whatever, if you're a man,
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.300]   and vice versa, right?
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.160]   So it was very interesting to see that.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.780]   But they did this before FaceApp was a thing,
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.940]   and they basically took yourself,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.820]   and they aged you to be older, and they said,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.700]   and after people that saw these photo-realistic,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.860]   older versions of themselves,
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.060]   they were more likely to save more
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.460]   and increase their retirement contributions afterwards,
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.500]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   So just from that little thing.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.260]   And they've done other studies where they ask people,
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.140]   what are you saving for?
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.100]   And they find that the only real saving motive,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.220]   whether you're saving for an emergency,
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.140]   saving for your kid's education,
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.540]   vacation, marriage, whatever,
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.660]   the only one that really causes people to save
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.820]   and can save consistently is saving for yourself.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.100]   So when it comes to saving money,
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.660]   be selfish is what I say.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.460]   So, and I think between that research
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.100]   and the other surveys they've done,
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.620]   I don't know how great, perfect they are,
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.140]   but I feel like it's a pretty good way to go with it.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.340]   - And if you're interested in that topic,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.500]   I'll put in a little selfish plug for our podcast.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.380]   We did have Hal Hirschfeld on "The Long View."
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.420]   We spoke to him, maybe it was earlier.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.700]   Yeah, it was not too long ago.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.820]   It's real interesting research that he's done
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.420]   and Nick does an outstanding job of walking through it
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.660]   in the context of the book.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.740]   I maybe wanted to sort of couch this
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.700]   in the experience that you're having.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.140]   You know, you're at an RIA, you're dealing with clients,
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.180]   they're being confronted, not only by a market downturn,
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.140]   but synchronous declines across asset classes,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.820]   except for things like maybe commodities related.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.540]   And so what are those conversations sound like right now
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.140]   when you have clients that are coming to you
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.380]   and questioning the virtues of diversification,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.020]   questioning the benefits that diversification
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.900]   might confer to them in light of the experience
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.620]   that they've been having recently,
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.100]   beyond sort of the obvious, which is, well,
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.740]   like you said earlier, it's only a year, you know,
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.260]   your time horizon is much longer than that.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.980]   What else, what else has been mentioned
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.780]   in talking to them about diversification
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.660]   and how to approach that?
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.300]   - So I don't talk to clients
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.980]   because I would say it's only been 10 months.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.260]   Why are you like freaking out?
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.180]   So there's a reason I'm in the back office,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.020]   if I'm being honest.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.300]   So, but I think in more seriously though,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.820]   like we are talking about these things.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.900]   We're talking about, you know, we have certain strategies.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.940]   I'm not trying to plug the firm,
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.820]   but we have certain strategies and things we use
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.820]   to kind of do risk off and trend following
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.580]   and stuff like that when necessary.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.740]   And so I do think it's about focusing
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.900]   on like the long-term plan.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.020]   I think Dan Egan said something very interesting yesterday,
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.180]   which is kind of also how we like to think long-term.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.820]   If you think about, you know,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.940]   every dollar that you have for retirement,
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.060]   that's eventually gonna be converted
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.460]   into some sort of income measure when you're retired, right?
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.260]   So let's just use a rough metric.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.780]   For every $100, you basically need 30,000.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.300]   You know, that's like rough 4% rule, right?
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.100]   $100 a month, you need 30,000 in capital.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.340]   So if your retirement account right now is down,
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.820]   let's say 90,000, what that equilibrates to in retirement
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.220]   is you just lost $300 a month for the rest of your retirement
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.900]   all else equal, assuming, you know,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.260]   the market would just stay like this forever.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.220]   So when you're thinking about that, you're like, okay,
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.860]   I didn't lose 90,000, I lost $300 a month
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.700]   for the rest of my life.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.380]   And I'm not saying that's trivial,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.660]   but it's just when you think of it that way,
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.620]   it's a little bit different.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.260]   You can kind of adjust that way.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.620]   And most retirees, if you actually look
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.740]   at how they actually spend their money,
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.060]   they're not using the 4% rule.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.500]   They just match to their income.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.780]   They have five grand a month in income,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.460]   they spend five grand a month at most, right?
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.180]   They don't say, oh, I have this much.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.340]   And most of them don't do this and say,
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.100]   oh, I have a million dollars, I'm gonna pull 40,000.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.940]   No, they don't do that.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.020]   They say, I have a million dollars.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.260]   How much income do I have plus all security?
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.740]   And then they adjust that way.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.060]   - Why don't we shift and we'll talk
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.380]   about retirement and taxes.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.260]   Recent retirees, as we all know,
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.420]   have been greeted by a painful market downturn
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.540]   and high inflation.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.060]   What do you think they should be doing
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.500]   to ensure they don't outlive their assets?
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.620]   And conversely, what should they refrain from doing?
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.400]   - I mean, I think this is kind of a misnomer
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   in the industry.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.320]   I think there's all this fear about people outliving assets,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   but I think it doesn't happen that often,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.160]   if I'm being honest.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.760]   Especially, as I said, once you look at how retirees
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.960]   actually spend their money
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.080]   and how people think about retirement.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.800]   Once I said, people use simple heuristics.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.020]   They use the payment on a mortgage,
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.600]   and in retirement, they use income.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.960]   So most people are not using the 4% rule.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.280]   Of the people, so 40% of retirees don't have any savings,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.800]   they're just using Social Security.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.480]   But of the 60% that have savings,
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.960]   which is probably everybody in this room,
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.360]   they only, one in seven actually pulls down principal
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.240]   in a given year.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.080]   Six out of seven do not pull down principal.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.440]   They just live off the investment income
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.640]   or even less than the investment income.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.560]   Most people who get RMDs,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.080]   the Required Minimum Distributions,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.660]   they reinvest most of that money.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.640]   I think there was a,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.960]   I can't remember which panel it was yesterday,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.880]   they said there was a Vanguard Payout Fund,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.840]   which is like, hey, you have to spend this money
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.140]   and it pays out to you.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.440]   And most people would just take that money
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.660]   and reinvest it in the fund,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.320]   and the fund manager was getting very frustrated.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.820]   So I think the idea that people,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.440]   I'm not saying people don't run out of assets,
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   I think that would be very foolish,
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.760]   but I don't think it's as big of a problem
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.080]   as people think it is.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.760]   People just adjust and they just cut back.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.600]   They're gonna tighten the belt
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.240]   and they're gonna say, hey, my income's down
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.440]   because the market's down, I'm just gonna cut back.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.820]   Or inflation's up, I'm gonna cut back in these areas.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.880]   And so people make do.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.080]   I mean, for most, retirees are just living
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.800]   off Social Security, which on average is $1,500 a month.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.840]   So it's not a lot, but you have two people,
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.680]   maybe you have a spouse there,
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   now you have three grand a month,
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.720]   assuming your mortgage is paid off,
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.040]   you can probably get by with that.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.200]   - Yeah, some of the other retirement myth-busting
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.320]   that you do in the book, you mention,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.800]   you think that probably people are overstating the risk
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.980]   that they'll outlive their retirement assets.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.880]   A couple of others that you mentioned are,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.440]   they'll be worse off,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.600]   and also that Social Security won't be there for them.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.760]   You wanna talk about those other two categories
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.500]   and why you think those are myths
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.820]   that probably need to be dispelled?
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.060]   - Yeah, so I think Social Security's gonna be there.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.820]   Even if the fund runs out of money,
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.100]   just from people who are paying into the system,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.820]   you know, younger accumulators,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.020]   they'll be able to pay at least 70% of benefits
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.500]   to like, I don't know, 2070 or something.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.720]   Of course, every year it changes.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.140]   I think there's gonna probably be some sort
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.600]   of reduction in benefits,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.120]   so they'll raise their retirement age or something.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.180]   But to think that when I hit retirement,
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.520]   it's gonna be $0 a month,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.220]   I would be absolutely shocked by that.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.320]   I don't think there's any evidence that's gonna happen.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.860]   I do think they'll have to reduce benefits
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.340]   or do something with retirement age
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.900]   to kind of make it work,
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.400]   but I don't think this whole idea
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.780]   that it's just gonna run dry
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.860]   and there's no one's paying in,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.280]   I think just doesn't make sense.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.140]   Now, in terms of some of the other things you said
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.020]   about people running out of money,
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.260]   I think one of my favorite studies that was done on this,
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.380]   Michael Kitsies, who many of you may know,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.780]   wrote a post about,
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.860]   they were just using a 60/40 portfolio, 4% rule,
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.820]   and basically over 30 years,
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.140]   you're more likely to 4X your wealth
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.300]   than you are to go below your starting principle, right?
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.260]   So if you have a million dollars
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.300]   and you're pulling, doing the 4% rule on a 60/40,
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.180]   historically, you would have had 4 million after 30 years,
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.220]   more likely to have 4 million than below a million,
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.720]   which goes to show most retirees,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.420]   your wealth just keeps going up in retirement.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.280]   Of course, this year, that's not true,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.700]   but generally, most of the time,
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.120]   if you retired in 2017,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.300]   you've probably done pretty well for yourself, right?
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.020]   So I think that's the thing to kind of keep in mind here.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.460]   And in terms of whether retired,
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.380]   future retirees are gonna be better off,
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.660]   this is a very interesting question.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.960]   I do think millennials have had it a little bit tougher
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.980]   than prior generations.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.060]   I know this is not me just saying this,
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.300]   'cause it's given I'm a millennial,
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.140]   but I mean, there have been differences
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.580]   in the housing market amongst other things.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.860]   Things are more expensive.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.940]   At the same time though,
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.780]   I think future retirees will be better off
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.500]   'cause all this wealth has to be passed down somehow.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.540]   More importantly, I mean,
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.260]   I don't think wealth is the only metric to look at.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.820]   I mean, the story I like to tell,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.660]   so Cornelius Vanderbilt, right?
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.540]   Everyone knows who the Vanderbilts are.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.780]   He was, in 1864, he was worth $40 million,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.500]   which is a couple billion when you change
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.900]   for inflation and everything.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.260]   His favorite son, who's gonna take over his empire
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.540]   and everything, died of tuberculosis.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.940]   25% of people in Europe died of tuberculosis
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.220]   in the 1800s, right?
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.540]   The richest man in the world couldn't stop a disease
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.500]   that today, basically, like 500 to 1,000 people
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.340]   in the US die of.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.700]   So we wanna talk about being better off.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.460]   I think stuff like that is completely,
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.100]   I think if you could, would anyone in here
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.660]   trade places with Cornelius Vanderbilt?
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.860]   I think almost no one would.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.100]   Maybe someone would, but I think most people would not.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.260]   And so I think that's something to keep in mind.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.820]   I'm not saying that those advances will happen
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.180]   in the next 30 years in that way,
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.060]   but over the next, our grandchildren
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.980]   and great-grandchildren should have much better lives
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.640]   than we did, I think, on average.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.980]   - I'm gonna ask you about 401(k)s,
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.500]   which you write about in the book.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.340]   You do warn about contributing too much to a 401(k),
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.780]   which is a somewhat controversial take,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.300]   and I actually think there was a thread
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.420]   on Vogelheads about this at one point.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.500]   Can you walk through your thought process on that?
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.740]   - Sorry, I said get ready for this one.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.300]   So I just wanted to start a discussion around this.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.660]   I think saying you should never max out your 401(k)
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.060]   is a foolish thing to say, but I also think the opposite,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.420]   you should always max out your 401(k)
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.580]   is also equally foolish.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.940]   And the reason I say that is because no one actually looks
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.820]   at what is the actual after-tax benefit
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.540]   of everything above the match, right?
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.740]   I think you should always get to the match,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.460]   there's no debate there, it's free money.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.980]   Everything above the match, no one's actually analyzed
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.540]   how much that after-tax benefit is,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.260]   and then adjusting for the fees
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.340]   you have to pay in your 401(k).
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.680]   So let's just walk through this very simply.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.060]   I'm gonna use a Roth 401(k)
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.060]   because I only care about the avoiding capital gains.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.520]   As you guys know, there's traditional 401(k)
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.260]   and there's Roth, and that difference
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.620]   is an income tax difference.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.660]   I don't wanna look at that, so let's put that aside.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.640]   Let's say you've already paid your income tax,
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.380]   so now you're in a Roth 401(k)
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.420]   and you're comparing that to a brokerage account,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.980]   that you have some discipline,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.260]   you're not trading in and out every year,
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.140]   you just have some discipline
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.740]   in a taxable brokerage account.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.660]   Okay, how big is the benefit of having the Roth
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.820]   against all those capital gains?
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.260]   At a 15% capital gains rate over 30, 40 years,
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.500]   the average after-tax benefit is about 73 bps.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.260]   Let's say 70 to 80 bps to make it easy, right?
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.900]   So if that's how much extra benefit
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.940]   you're getting in a 401(k),
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.300]   the question is, well, what about the fees?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.860]   The average fee in a 401(k),
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.020]   and this is not even the fund fees,
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.700]   this is just the all-in fees, is about 40 bps.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.460]   So half of that's already gone just from the 401(k).
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.420]   So now you're getting only about 20 to 30 bps a year
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.980]   in extra after-tax benefit by maxing.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.100]   And my question is, is it worth it
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.540]   for that extra 20 to 30 bps?
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.060]   And I know over a very long period of time that can add up,
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.560]   but is that worth the flexibility?
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   So I'm just running the numbers.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.660]   I'm saying, hey, when you look at these numbers,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.380]   it doesn't look like it's always worth it.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.100]   And then that doesn't even include the people
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.860]   that have like a 401(k) fee that's like 1% or more.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.900]   If your 401(k) fee's over a percent,
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.380]   all the after-tax benefit is gone, right?
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.340]   So if you have a good 401(k), you're young,
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.100]   you're saving a lot, it's probably fine.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.140]   But I kind of regret maxing for a few years
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.900]   because that money I could have had outside
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.380]   in a taxable brokerage account that I could have been using
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.220]   to maybe buy a house or afford a wedding
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.180]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.460]   And I think the flexibility and the optionality
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.420]   is more important than that 20 to 30 bps a year.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.300]   And I just want us to kind of talk about that
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.160]   because every personal finance expert
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.220]   says max out your 401(k) and I'm one of the,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.740]   I think there are others now,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.180]   but I have not met many that don't say that.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.860]   - Yeah, another piece of conventional wisdom
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.580]   that you challenge in the book very thoughtfully at that
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   is on asset location.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.940]   You argue for putting growth assets
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.860]   in tax advantage accounts and low growth assets
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.700]   like bond funds in taxable accounts.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.140]   Can you talk about why you hold that view,
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.460]   how you came to that conclusion?
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.660]   - So historically, bond yields and obviously distributions
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.820]   were much higher than they are now,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.100]   I mean, maybe not now now,
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.780]   but where they were when I was writing the book.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.820]   And so as a result, most people would say,
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.980]   oh, you wanna shield that income from your bonds,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.860]   you wanna put it in your qualified accounts
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.500]   and you wanna put your stocks,
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.740]   which don't have any payments, right,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.520]   besides maybe a dividend once in a while,
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.920]   into your taxable accounts.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.660]   But the truth is you wanna have your highest growth assets
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.140]   in your non-taxable and your qualified accounts, right?
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.980]   Now that's if you're just trying
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.980]   to maximize every dollar you can.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.500]   I personally don't do that.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.180]   I think the way to go is to have every kind of account
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.860]   be like a carbon copy of each other.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.380]   So if I have a, I'm gonna make this very simple.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.740]   I have a 60/40, I have a 60/40 in my taxable account,
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.900]   I have a 60/40 in my 401(k), I have a 60/40 everywhere else.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.900]   It also makes it very easy to rebalance across accounts
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.060]   because I don't have to take,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.540]   I can't get money out of my non-taxable
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.100]   and put it into my brokerage and vice versa.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.140]   So because of that, I just kind of have them
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.900]   be cookie cutters of each other.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.260]   But in theory, if you're trying to maximize every dollar,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.340]   you should put as much of your high growth assets
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.940]   into non-taxable accounts.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.460]   And I think the person that did this best
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.700]   was Peter Thiel when he put his PayPal shares
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.140]   into a Roth IRA and it's now worth $5 billion, so.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.800]   But we all can't be so lucky.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.460]   - We're gonna shift and talk about behavioral
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.420]   and maybe we'll get to trading.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.860]   I think you've said that around 90%
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.620]   of your personal investments are in traditional asset classes
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.380]   like stocks and bonds and the remainder
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.340]   are in what you term non-income producing assets.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.180]   So it could be stuff like art, crypto and the like.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.220]   How'd you arrive at that mix and do you view the 10%
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.940]   as a way of scratching an itch to play
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.700]   in more speculative fare without putting
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.180]   your financial future at risk?
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.460]   - Yeah, that's exactly what I would say.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.900]   Every person's gonna be different in terms
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.860]   of how much risk they wanna take in what I call
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.440]   non-income producing assets like gold, wine, art, et cetera.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.060]   I just came up with, I say 85 to 90% of your assets
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.180]   should be in income producing, they have cash flows,
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.780]   there's something, I think there's some fundamental weight
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.860]   to cash flows and even though yes,
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.380]   people can bid up and down prices,
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.380]   there's still something there.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.820]   It's like a suitcase with $100,000 in it.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.420]   People may not know exactly how much money's
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.700]   in the suitcase but they have an idea
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.280]   and so they will bid up and down the suitcase
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.580]   but there's still some sort of fundamental value
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.380]   in the suitcase and I think that's what cash flows
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.860]   represent in theory.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.600]   So that's why I'm a fan of income producing assets
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.140]   and why I recommend most people to,
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.060]   and I don't, I think most people in this audience
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.860]   would probably agree with that so I'm not worried about it.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.460]   - In the book, you write that just keep buying
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.660]   is easier to follow today than at any point in history
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.180]   'cause it's much easier to transact
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.120]   and you can diversify in a snap, to paraphrase.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.500]   The flip side is it's never been easier to sell
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.900]   and transact in general.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.060]   How confident are you that the benefits conferred
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.380]   by easier purchase of assets exceeds the cost some incur
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.340]   in opportunity buying and selling as we saw them do,
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.040]   unfortunately, during some stages of the last few years?
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.780]   - Yeah, so I think the benefits way outweigh the costs.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.700]   I mean, I think Jason Zweig said something yesterday
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.340]   that because of technology, it's the best it's ever been
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.500]   for investors and I completely agree with that.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.020]   Now, of course, does it make it easier to sell?
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.700]   Yes, but if you're disciplined,
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.420]   that shouldn't matter all that much.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.420]   I don't think a $15 trade cost is stopping,
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.120]   when the market's down and you're panicking,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.860]   I don't think it's like, well, I would sell
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.220]   but that $15, if you just lost 10 grand,
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.100]   oh, I don't wanna spend that 15 bucks.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.080]   I don't think that's enough of a barrier
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.420]   to stop people from selling personally
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.000]   but that's kind of how I look at it, so.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.420]   - I had a few more questions and then I think
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.780]   we'll throw it open to the audience for questions.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   Am I just gonna hand the mic to you and walk it around?
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.440]   Okay, sounds good, so if you do have sort of questions
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.220]   that you'd like to ask Nick, you'll have an opportunity
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   in the next few minutes to do so.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.860]   But Nick, I did wanna ask you about something
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.460]   you touch on in the book, which is the inadequacy
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.180]   of your education on financial matters
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.020]   during your upbringing.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.160]   Reflecting on that, what do you think is the best way
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.780]   to educate young people about finances?
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.460]   - I think it's a really difficult question
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.520]   but I think just exposing people to these things
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.980]   and kind of getting them out there,
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.880]   I think the Bogleheads does a great job at that
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.720]   and talking to people.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.860]   I know every one of you has networks,
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.220]   you can talk to younger people,
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.500]   people who don't know about this stuff
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.820]   and just knowing that, they'll say,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.740]   "Hey, I know that person, maybe I should look into it
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.900]   "or maybe you recommend a book or whatever it is."
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.780]   It's stuff like that that kind of gets people interested
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.220]   and the only reason I even learned this stuff,
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.820]   I haven't been in the financial industry that long,
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.980]   I've been here for four years,
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.340]   but I've been writing for about six now
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.140]   and the only reason I know is 'cause I read
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.700]   William Bernstein and Jason Zweig
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.060]   and I wouldn't be here without them.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.020]   That's period, end of statement.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.540]   If I wasn't reading Jason in the journal
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.860]   or wasn't reading Intelligent Asset Allocator,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.500]   I wouldn't care about the data and all this stuff.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.280]   So I think it's stuff like that
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.780]   that really can make an impact on people.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.060]   You can change people's lives, I think, in a very big way.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.420]   I think last night we saw that with Taylor Latimore,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.780]   he's like, "The house that Jack built,
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.020]   "there is something to that."
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.260]   And people, you don't realize the impact you have on people
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.780]   until it's already too late.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.900]   - So one more before we turn it over
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.660]   to the audience for questions.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.340]   Maybe we'll leave the audience with a parting gift.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.260]   Who's an under-the-radar writer or podcaster
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.300]   on personal finance or investing matters
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.620]   that you'd recommend reading or listening to?
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.500]   - So there's a woman named Katie, K-A-T-I-E.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.020]   Her brand is Money With Katie
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.780]   and I'm not just gonna tell you go read her,
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.620]   but I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.220]   So this whole idea of thinking about
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.060]   every $100 a month in retirement,
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.100]   that's $30,000 you need in capital, that was her idea.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.940]   And I took it from her and did not say that,
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.340]   but I would have told you guys.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.100]   So it was her idea and it's really great.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.280]   And it's a great way to think about,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.540]   okay, so let's say you need four grand a month in retirement,
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.940]   you get 1,500 from Social Security,
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.060]   that's the average benefit.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.500]   That means you need 2,500 a month extra.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.740]   Well, how much does that mean?
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.020]   If you're using 4% rule very simply,
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   you do 30,000 times those $100 units, and that's $750,000.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.220]   So you can now back out very easily
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.860]   how much you would need for your income.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.300]   So I think it's a cool rule, it's very easy to think about.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.660]   And it's also, when you're thinking about your retirement,
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.020]   you're like, oh, I'm down, as I said,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.980]   let's say you're down 30 grand,
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.820]   that means you're down $100 a month in retirement,
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.660]   although it's equal, right?
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.740]   If you're down 300 grand, that's $1,000 a month, right?
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.220]   So there's very easy ways to kind of think about that
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.940]   and how it easily translates into income.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.700]   And I think heuristics like that can be helpful.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.860]   - That's great.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.020]   So with that, why don't we go ahead
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.420]   and we'll open it up to questions from the audience.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.700]   - Hi there.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   Just a little bit of helpful basics of investing.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:48.020]   I wanted to discuss your maxing out your 401(k).
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.200]   I think we have a difference of opinion here.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.540]   But first thing is, you mentioned the word BIPs,
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.300]   BPS, to new investors.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.480]   You're talking about the basis point, initialized BPS.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.740]   That is 1/100 of 1%.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.820]   So that's to investors,
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.740]   just to explain a little bit about that.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.620]   But I didn't quite catch this,
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.100]   but you were, based on your assumptions, your comparison,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.260]   you are comparing, you don't want to max out your 401(k)
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.900]   because you'd rather put it in taxable.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.220]   To me, and you said you had like a 20 or 30 BIPs difference,
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.780]   and you were ignoring, you used the word 401(k)
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.340]   because you wanted to ignore income tax.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.580]   To me, this is a behavioral change
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.740]   because the reason you put money into a 401(k)
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.700]   is because you can't take it out until you hit 59 1/2.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.980]   If you do that trade now, while you're accumulating,
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.580]   there's that behavioral thing that says,
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.300]   oh, money's in taxable, I can use it to pay the bills.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.820]   No, it's for saving for retirement.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:52.220]   So I would disagree, or I'll make sure I,
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.060]   tell me if I'm misunderstanding anything.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.260]   But I would absolutely max out the 401(k)
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.020]   because of the behavioral aspects.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.260]   And besides, you don't know your tax rate.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.060]   I don't think you can ignore taxes.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.260]   You can't predict that.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.180]   So take the safe approach, conservative approach,
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.460]   and max it out.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.700]   And another promo for the wiki,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.180]   prioritizing investments is a very key page
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.820]   on how you should save for retirement.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.900]   So that's a little bit different
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.180]   from what you're discussing, but say,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.660]   use the wiki as prioritizing investments,
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.500]   and that will tell you how to save.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.140]   So that's what I wanted to say, just a difference, thanks.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.820]   - Yeah, so I think the behavioral benefits
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.960]   are definitely there.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.860]   I'm guessing, and I don't wanna,
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.420]   I don't actually have data on this,
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.300]   but I'm just guessing based on a lot of people
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.260]   I've talked to, so I will say this is anecdotal,
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.700]   but the people who are maxing their 401(k),
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.620]   I'm assuming most of those people are disciplined enough
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.060]   to, when they're saving in their brokerage account,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.660]   they're not, it's like, I have a brokerage account,
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.860]   why haven't I drained all that?
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.460]   It's because I put the money in there,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.740]   and I don't use it for bills or groceries and things like that.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.220]   I'm not saying that people don't do that.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.060]   That does happen.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.020]   So for some people, that is a feature, that's a benefit.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.160]   So I'm not saying for everybody that's not true.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.420]   So if you're someone who thinks you might touch the money,
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.740]   then yes, max, I agree with that completely.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.700]   But if you're someone who knows
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.860]   you're not gonna be touching that,
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.700]   then I would say, hey, you probably don't need to max.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.980]   I think the optionality is worth more than that.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.500]   But yeah, you have to be disciplined, I agree.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.700]   That is a condition I should have specified.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:23.340]   - Yeah, so when are, could you list some situations
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.620]   where you would recommend that an investor
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.460]   adopt trend following instead of a buy and hold portfolio?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.180]   And then what are some advantages and risks,
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.740]   and you can compare that to a buy and hold portfolio?
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.100]   - I think trend's really tough.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.380]   I think, I won't name names here,
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.300]   but one of the best trend followers in our industry's fund
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.900]   missed, sold in March 2020,
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.540]   and then bought back four months later
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.140]   after most of the rally happened.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.740]   I think it's really tough to know this type of stuff.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.740]   So I'm gonna be honest with you,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.500]   it's difficult.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.540]   If you're going to do it, I think behaviorally,
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.900]   you have to make it a smaller portion of your portfolio,
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.900]   so not all of your assets,
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.860]   'cause I think the whip sawing can really get you,
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.860]   and behaviorally, it's not great.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.020]   But I think having some of your money risk off
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.060]   while markets are crashing
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.020]   gives you enough of a behavioral hedge to say,
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.740]   hey, at least I got 10, 20% of it out
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.700]   before all this happened.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.100]   So I don't recommend it for most of your portfolio.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.460]   I think the swings are too violent,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.620]   but I think having a smaller allocation to it
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.700]   can be helpful.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.540]   How do you do it?
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.380]   There's a lot of ways,
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.660]   there's a lot of different arguments
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.700]   about which moving average you use and things like that,
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.540]   but most of the time it's just following price,
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.580]   and that tells you a lot.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.420]   - Thank you.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:35.220]   - I actually had a different follow-up
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.580]   from when Lady Geek had about the maxing out 401(k).
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.220]   I think one of the most important considerations
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.660]   is that for most people,
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.180]   you're not stuck with the 401(k) forever.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.660]   When you leave your employer,
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.660]   you can roll your 401(k) into an IRA,
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.780]   and at that point there's no extra cost,
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.780]   or if you retire on a lower tax bracket
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.900]   and it was a traditional 401(k) there's an extra benefit.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.860]   So I think that it is important to consider the cost,
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.780]   and it's something that sometimes does come up
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.460]   on the Bogleheads forum,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.500]   but unless you really expect you're gonna be stuck
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.340]   with this employer for 20 years,
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.700]   which happens unfortunately to a lot of teachers
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.780]   in particular who have high-cost 403(b)s,
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.780]   you need to look at the cost of the 403(b)
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.300]   or 401(k) is only compounded according
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.900]   to how long you expect to stay in the job.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.940]   And so I think that's a better number to look at.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.540]   - I agree completely.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.420]   I just wanted to open the discussion
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.380]   because a lot of people don't even look at their 401(k) fees
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.340]   and if you're paying over 1%, you're losing that benefit.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.220]   So it's really just about opening the discussion
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.140]   because if 10 out of 10 personal finance experts
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.540]   say max out your 401(k),
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.460]   there's a lot of people who are getting screwed over,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.300]   unfortunately.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.820]   And that actually comes up on the forum.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.380]   I have people who say I'm paying over 1% in this 401(k)
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.100]   and then I say, well, do you expect
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.140]   to leave this employer in five years?
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.740]   If so, you're losing 5%
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.380]   and it's probably worth losing 5%
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.460]   while if you're gonna be there for your whole career.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.300]   - You'd have to run the numbers on that.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.060]   - Yeah, if you're gonna be there for your whole career
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.500]   and you're losing 30%, - No, I agree.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.860]   - Then no, you don't wanna lose 30% of your,
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.020]   to that.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.180]   - Thank you.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.580]   - And a great job with the presentation
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.140]   and I enjoy your blog. - Thank you.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.060]   - One little thing that I wanna kinda just mention,
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.100]   you talked about like focusing on
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.820]   like the things that matter at the right time
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.260]   and I mostly agree with that,
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.340]   but there's like one little nuance
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.420]   that I think it's really worth pointing out
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.620]   'cause I'm kind of an extreme example of that.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.340]   So my wife and I, we figured out how to save
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.220]   half of our income from basically day one
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.580]   and we doubled our income within a couple of years.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.300]   So if you do that, you're gonna end up
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.980]   with a big balance really quickly,
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.140]   which is the good part of the advice.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.900]   We also were the extreme on the other side
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.980]   where we didn't know anything about investing.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.580]   And so we ended up with this like six figure portfolio
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.340]   and actively managed funds with huge taxable gains.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.860]   We had to figure out how to get rid of,
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.900]   and we had a, in a rollover account,
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   we had a variable annuity,
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.340]   we had to figure out how to get rid of.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.380]   And so that can be really expensive and painful.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.220]   So I think the beauty of the Bogleheads philosophy
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.340]   is like just not that you can focus
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.260]   on these big things early,
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.700]   and if you get those right,
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.900]   it can save you a lot of pain later.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.380]   So I agree with you, I think 98% of the way there,
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.180]   but I think that little bit of nuance
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.900]   of getting those things right early too,
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.300]   because if you don't,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.540]   you can find yourself in a lot of pain
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.180]   and it costs us a lot in opportunity costs to get there
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.340]   and then going forward, tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.500]   So it's really important to not totally ignore that either.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.620]   And I think that's preaching to the choir here,
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.700]   but just as we try to educate people going forward,
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.820]   I think that's an important point
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.620]   and love to hear your thoughts.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.460]   - No, I agree.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.740]   I mean, of course I would say,
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.740]   buy low cost index funds or ETFs, right?
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.300]   I'm never gonna stray from that.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.140]   I've been a Boglehead.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.740]   I used to be a Boglehead in the Boston chapter.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.700]   And so I don't disagree with that at all.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.540]   I would buy, of course,
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.140]   but there's so many people out there
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.780]   who spend so many hours analyzing their trading,
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.620]   this and that.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.540]   And it's like, okay, you made an extra $1,000,
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.580]   let's say you have a $10,000 portfolio
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.180]   and you had a 10% alpha.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.820]   So you 10% more than what the market earned.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.180]   You earned an extra $1,000,
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.300]   but you spend 10 hours a week doing that.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.380]   So let's run the math on that.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.740]   $1,000, 10 hours a week.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.660]   Let's say you took two weeks off for vacation.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.940]   That's 50 weeks, 500 hours, $1,000, 500 hours.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.020]   You made $2 an hour.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.980]   You better go into McDonald's and saving that extra money.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   So you start running these things very quickly
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.140]   and you're like, oh, wow, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.100]   So I agree with you.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.260]   Yes, you should have a low cost portfolio.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.780]   I agree with all that stuff.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.620]   Don't touch it.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.460]   Just keep buying.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.700]   That's the premise of the book.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.860]   The same time though, it's like how much does that matter
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.340]   versus just that person raising their income,
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.060]   even working at McDonald's would have been better
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   for that person than what they did.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.340]   Now, of course, if that person was managing a billion
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.940]   dollars, this is a very different story, but they're not.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.780]   - Hey, Nick.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.180]   Wondering, any advice on being a smart consumer
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.740]   of long-term capital market expectations?
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.900]   I see different models around.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.460]   Some of them have mean reverting valuations.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.100]   Some of them are simpler.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.940]   What works?
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.060]   - I think this is a tough question.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.740]   Once again, it's like trying to predict the future
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.380]   and it's like, I just assume, and I think everyone
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.860]   should be conservative in their modeling.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.900]   And so I try to assume a 4% real return going forward
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.940]   across a globally diversified income producing asset
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.300]   portfolio, that's what I assume.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.580]   And if you look at like the equity risk premiums,
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.380]   DFA has released some data on this across like
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.820]   most developed countries, it's like four to 5%.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.900]   Obviously the US, South Africa, Australia,
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.580]   there are exceptions to this rule that are on the high end.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.540]   And then there's exceptions on the low end,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.300]   which is like Russia this year, Greece, right?
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.660]   We can think about those, Japan a little bit, right?
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.140]   So I think for the most part, just try and find
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.500]   a good conservative estimate going forward.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.300]   And I think 4% real is the way to use.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.500]   Obviously everyone, we can differ on that and that's fine,
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.340]   but I just use that and I find it works well.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:43.100]   - Sorry, this is about the 401k, but I have two questions.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:46.580]   I think what you said is partially true,
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.060]   but specifically for the Roth, there are ways and tricks
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.700]   to get out the money before you reach 59 1/2,
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.180]   like rolling over the Roth IRA, that's the five year rule,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.740]   two five year rules, and you meet that,
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.980]   you wouldn't have this problem.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.340]   So it's partially correct.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.820]   The traditional one I think is a bit tougher to pull out.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.500]   There is one thing that you're missing though.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.420]   The 401k has creditor protection
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.620]   and you don't have any creditor protection in taxable.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.380]   And I think that is worth like the 20, 30 basis points.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.940]   And I think we also have to assume
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.540]   that the person doing this is somewhat intelligent enough
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.140]   to have extra cash in taxable assets
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.220]   in cases of emergency.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.460]   So like the wedding that you need the money for
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:29.340]   shouldn't be a thing.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.580]   Like this is something that you should be planning for.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.100]   So just my comments.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.540]   My other more important question is that
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.260]   I've noticed you have a 10% non-traditional assets
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.660]   where you put your fund money in, scratch your itch.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.740]   And I have something similar.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.100]   And I've tried for over 15 years
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.020]   and I could never get any asset
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.620]   that would do well in practice.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.540]   And I'm wondering if you have found anything
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.100]   that works well in practice.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.300]   Or if not, maybe we can go through the list of stuff
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.780]   that has utterly failed in your experience.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.580]   - I mean, I've gotten lucky, I will say that.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.340]   My most famous tweet, I think,
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.420]   besides I did this tweet about Leonardo DiCaprio
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.300]   and the women he dates and how old they are,
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.940]   but let's not get into that right now.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.140]   But my most famous, no, it was actually went
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.180]   like 30 million impressions.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.020]   It was crazy.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.060]   Anyways, I did not expect that.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.500]   My most famous tweet before that was I said,
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.660]   I sold my Bitcoin, half my Bitcoin at $52,000.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.580]   Ask me anything.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.940]   And I was draped over the coals.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.700]   Like how are you gonna tell your future grandchildren
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.700]   about this and like how disappointing they're gonna be
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.540]   and all this stuff.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.260]   So there are ways you can do it.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.660]   You have to obviously get lucky.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.540]   Like obviously I bought Bitcoin much cheaper
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.780]   and I sold half of it at 52K.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.820]   And so it's one of those examples where it can happen.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.260]   I think on net, I'm up, but wait, I also lost a bunch of,
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.440]   I lost 70% in a little bit of money,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.300]   but in altcoins this year, and that was stupid.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.460]   But on net, I'm probably up a little, but I agree.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.300]   It's probably not.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.500]   I should have just bought the S&P 500.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.060]   Every time I've regretted that, I should have just,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.460]   like I should have just listened to myself.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.860]   Why didn't I just, have I read my own book?
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   I'm an idiot, right?
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.340]   - Thank you for being here, Nick.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.860]   I've learned a lot from your writing
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.900]   over the last few years.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.700]   And I just, you've been very kind to us saying,
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.260]   this audience probably already knows this.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.180]   This audience probably already knows that.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.300]   What is a mistake that you would be afraid
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.380]   that we would make?
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.940]   The people in this room who are pretty knowledgeable,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.940]   what's something you would be afraid of us overlooking?
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.860]   - Yeah, I think the, it's not an investment mistake.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.980]   It's not a mistake with how much you're saving.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.420]   It's probably your spending.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.060]   I think a great book out there is "Die With Zero."
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.660]   I know that book has a lot of connotations
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.620]   and stuff out there with it.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.700]   I'm not saying people should die with zero,
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.420]   but I think that's a closer approximation
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.660]   to about how people spend money.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.160]   I think over-accumulation is more of the problem,
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.460]   I'm guessing, in this room than anything else.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.540]   And so I think most people have nothing to worry about
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.220]   in terms of financial things.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.660]   This is like the rock stars of the financial world,
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.900]   the people like, trust me, I'm a nerd.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.580]   I've had spreadsheets, I do all this.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.700]   I know people in here love spreadsheets, I just know it.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.820]   I can feel the Excel energy in here.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.100]   So I'm just saying, if I'm saying what's the thing in here,
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.820]   it's spending the money and figuring out
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.580]   how to feel comfortable spending the money
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.700]   and how you can live a life that you enjoy with doing that.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.080]   And so a lot of different discussions we can have on that,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.340]   but I think that's the big thing I would say.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.180]   - Thank you.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.740]   - Thank you, everyone.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:41.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
