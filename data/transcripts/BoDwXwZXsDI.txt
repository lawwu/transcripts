[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Hello there, and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.720]   My name is Jeremy Howard.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.440]   I am the co-founder of FastAI, and this is the other co-founder of FastAI, Rachel Thomas.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.680]   Hi, I'm Rachel Thomas.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.520]   My background is I have a PhD in math, and I previously worked as a software engineer
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.440]   and data scientist.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520]   More recently, I'm the founding director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.400]   University of San Francisco, and as Jeremy said I'm also the co-founder of FastAI.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.760]   So Rachel is a mathematician / data scientist / software engineer turned data ethicist.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.960]   I am the opposite.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.400]   My major was actually in ethics, and nowadays I'm a professional data scientist.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.720]   So we both together are super interested in combining data and ethics and policy and society.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   And we found ourselves in a funny position last week where we were starting recording
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.480]   our big annual course, which hundreds of thousands of people a year watch right at the time that
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.240]   the COVID-19 thing was exploding.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.720]   And so we did some work looking at COVID-19 in terms of from what the data looks like.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.360]   Much to our surprise, the report we wrote has been read by well over half a million
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   people.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   The video we created as part of this course is being watched by thousands of people.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.360]   And there's a request for us to do more of that.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.040]   So here we are doing more of that.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.600]   And today we're going to tackle a topic which I think is likely to be the most important
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840]   topic we've ever tackled.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840]   So let's jump in.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.720]   So this is I think the hardest situation I've ever been in trying to teach.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   And the reason why is because I am in the United States of America.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.920]   And here in the US over the last 24 hours, there has been this extraordinary new movement,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.160]   which is basically to say, let's just let people die on the assumption that that's going
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.120]   to help the stock market.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.160]   And so if I seem a little less than Jovial today, it's because I am less than Jovial
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.080]   today.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.400]   So I'm not going to be talking about that in particular.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.080]   Hopefully it's actually pretty obvious that well, I mean, economists are already saying
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   it would cost about $5 trillion before we even start taking account of the lost productivity
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   due to the fact that people would not be going to work anymore when all of their friends
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.400]   and family are dying around them.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.040]   So economically not a great idea and you know, societally, maybe one of the most evil things
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.280]   I've ever heard in history.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.040]   But we're going to not focus on that, we're going to focus on a potentially interesting
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   part of a really important possible solution to the longer term.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.120]   The first thing I wanted to mention is we've been talking a lot about the importance of
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.080]   stopping the spread and a key part of that has been locking things down as soon as possible.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.480]   And interestingly, we're already seeing in the US the impact of that in the US, Kentucky
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.000]   and Tennessee right next to each other.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.600]   They are testing at similar rates and so you would expect them to have a similar spread.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.320]   Kentucky got in ahead of Tennessee when it came to doing a lockdown in terms of the,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.720]   you know, they actually just declared a state of emergency back on March the 6th.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   And you can see already the difference between the number of cases in Tennessee, positive
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   cases, positive tests versus the number of positive tests in Kentucky is an extraordinary
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   big difference.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.480]   So, so the stuff we are now seeing starting to happen around the Western world with these
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   lockdowns again and again we're seeing the earlier the better.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.200]   The orange bar here is the number of positive cases in Tennessee and the blue bar here is
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   the number of positive cases in Kentucky, whereas the lighter blue and lighter orange
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.960]   is the number of tests that have been done.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.440]   There's still people saying that maybe not that many people are actually dying and finding
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.040]   all kinds of obscure ways to murder the data to suggest that even Italy is actually not
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   that bad.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.800]   But the, you know, the fact is if you look for example in the region around Bergamo in
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   Italy, the number of people who died last week was four times higher than the number
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.640]   of people that died a year earlier.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.000]   So like regardless of how you think about what kind of testing is being done or you
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.120]   know what kind of post mortems are being done or whatever, there's four times more people
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.040]   dying you know of all causes in this region.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.680]   This thing is killing people at an astonishing rate and it's not even close to peaking.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.240]   So obviously we need these lockdowns but the question is what happens next.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.640]   And we saw last week this tweet from the Surgeon General saying don't buy masks, they're not
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.560]   effective except for healthcare providers.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.520]   And this has been a kind of pretty common refrain, it's certainly not only the US Surgeon
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.920]   General that's saying that and there certainly is a big issue.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:01.320]   Doctors are saying there is not enough protective equipment including enough masks for hospitals.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   So PPE is referring to this protective equipment, masks, gowns, eye shields.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.840]   There is a huge shortage.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:21.200]   And so perhaps the reason that a lot of policy folks are saying masks are not useful is to
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.440]   stop people buying them, I mean this is what he's saying here don't buy masks in the hope
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:34.240]   that that will cause there to be more masks available for folks in hospitals.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.280]   You know interestingly when you actually look at what hospitals are doing they're saying
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.320]   please, please donate us protective equipment.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.480]   These are things we need, not just protective equipment but even testing equipment.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.720]   But interestingly they're even saying handmade masks would be useful.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.460]   So you know it's interesting to see what the actual hospitals are saying they want.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:08.200]   And so when hospitals are saying we need masks and even handmade masks would be useful it
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.080]   starts to question this idea that like they're not useful for the public like why do hospitals
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   want them if they're not useful to the public like how does this work.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.920]   There's also some interesting empirical data very rough empirical data but if you look
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:37.360]   at all the countries which have flat curves they are all countries actually where mask
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.320]   wearing is extremely normal and not wearing a mask in places like public transport would
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.220]   be considered very anti-social.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:56.020]   So there's this kind of country level data that suggests that well something's going
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.600]   on in these countries and is masks part of that.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:12.040]   Taiwan does not appear on this at all because this they basically didn't have enough cases
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.360]   to appear on this graph at the time that this tweet came out.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.200]   They only have 153 cases and two deaths in the whole of Taiwan even though they're right
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.240]   next to China where this thing blasted off.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.840]   So what happened in China in Taiwan they are making 10 million masks per day.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.360]   Now I thought that sounded crazy unlikely but actually this is the leader of Taiwan
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:49.760]   and here she is saying yes Taiwan is now making 10 million masks per day and they're a small
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   country.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.200]   I think they're like 30 million people or if you like a small region depending on your
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.980]   politics around this.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:06.280]   So that kind of got me interested like thinking well if masks are important and a small country
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:13.200]   like this can create so many you know what does that mean for a country like the US is
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000]   that something we should be doing.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.280]   And so I started doing some research and I saw for example University of Michigan study
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:31.840]   on pandemic flu not on COVID-19 but this similarities and they found that combining hand washing
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:42.800]   and using masks makes a huge difference to the spread of pandemic flu 75% reduction.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.440]   Now 75% reduction would be the difference between a pandemic and something that would
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.020]   just die out and fizzle away.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.920]   So this is again indicative it's not proof.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.760]   So I started digging in some more and I asked the wider community to help and we now have
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:11.080]   a list of 30 papers or nearly 30 maybe it's 28 papers that have actually studied the question
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.360]   of the efficacy of masks as a way to stop spread and transmission from many different
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:26.600]   angles and many different types of masks and all of the research I've seen points to any
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:35.640]   kind of mask as being helpful to significantly stopping transmission.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.160]   So this has been quite a learning journey for me and so I've really focused on what
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   is the data say and just looking at primary research papers not at government recommendations
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   not at blogs but at actual science and we'll provide the link to these papers with the
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   video.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.800]   One of the most interesting things I discovered is in the Czech Republic which has a really
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.200]   fantastic healthcare system and is doing a lot of testing they actually made mask compulsory
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   for the whole country since March 18th if you want to go anywhere you have to wear a
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:21.660]   mask outside the house and they have these little illustrations the Czech here means
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:27.320]   your mask protects me my mask protects you and they're really focusing on the social
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.000]   side that if I have a mask on I and I might be sick and I don't know about it I am actually
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.200]   doing a pro social thing by helping you to not get sick.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.920]   In the whole country there's only been two deaths and look at how the you know we're
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:51.640]   not seeing the exponential growth in new cases it's actually flattened out.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.680]   So this is a super interesting situation so I started wondering like well how did that
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:03.440]   happen how did this country like the like very unusual in Europe to see mask wearing
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.160]   so how did this happen.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.320]   And there is this fantastic story about what happened.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:18.080]   You can find it at tiny.cc/masksrule strongly recommend reading it.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:26.120]   But basically what it says in fact let me jump to it now.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:35.280]   What it says is this guy Peter Ludwig who is a kind of a social media influencer who
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:43.960]   focuses in science communication made a video about the importance of wearing masks and
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:53.200]   that kind of kicked off this huge community reaction.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.880]   It's an amazing story and this is this is the video this is this is Peter and I after
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:10.120]   really digging into the data and the virology and the science of this I am pretty convinced
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.320]   that everybody wearing masks could be a key or probably is a key part of the solution
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.400]   to stopping the lockdown eventually getting the economy back on track restoring normal
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.560]   normalcy to society and reducing the spread.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   I am not as good a science communicator as Peter is.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.240]   So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to tell you what he said with his pictures.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.080]   OK so I get no credit for this.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.040]   I'm just repeating what he said because maybe you don't speak Czech.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.360]   So Peter started out his fantastic video by pointing out Mongolia.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.840]   Now Mongolia is right on the border of China.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.920]   So lots of people moving backwards and forwards right and somehow at the time that he did
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.760]   this the 14th of March they had only one case.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.640]   Today it's gone up to four cases.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:09.880]   It actually turned out that one case checked themselves out of hospital and against the
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   law went and hung out with 200 people over the next few days which is a terrible terrible
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   idea.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.040]   But how come Mongolia had only one case.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.120]   And so Peter said he noticed that something striking about Mongolia was they had a policy
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:35.360]   that you have to wear masks since January which is pretty extraordinary.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.840]   So Peter went on to describe and I'm using some of my own slides now.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:45.160]   His slides are much more his presentation is much nicer than mine but I wanted to show
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   you some additional information here.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.840]   So he described how there are different kinds of masks there are what are called respirators
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   the most common type being the N95 to just a rating and they're they're full seal hospital
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:10.480]   grade things right versus surgical masks which are these just loose fitting pieces of cloth.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.760]   The key thing here is that these these different pieces of protective equipment protect you
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:27.520]   from from different things but what's interesting is as Peter mentioned there there is research
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   that shows that even the basic loose fitting pieces of cloth actually works super well
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.400]   against a wide variety of viruses.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.440]   So this is actually the research that he's pointing out and this comes from smart air
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.840]   filters dot com but the actual data comes from this report Davis Adele they've just
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:56.700]   made it into a nice picture and what they found is that against 0.02 micron particles
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.080]   surgical masks are super effective vacuum cleaner but bags are super effective dish
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.840]   towels are super effective cotton t-shirts are super effective and then and actually
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.620]   in this study they had two different sized particles they also looked at point one micron
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.000]   particles I think it was point one and they found the same things were even more effective
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.240]   because 0.02 is particularly small they also looked at kind of doubling them up and they
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.600]   also looked at how well can you breathe through these different materials and they actually
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   came up with some suggestions around things that are easy to breathe through so in this
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:41.360]   case two t-shirts easy to breathe through and end up being pretty effective so anyway
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.560]   you can check out this fantastic article or the original paper for yourself but basically
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:53.640]   the story they found in in this research and a lot of other research I've looked at is
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:17:03.200]   for stopping the spread of viruses you don't need and 95 respirator masks at all you know
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:12.880]   I mean they're great but lots of other things work great as well so what's going on here
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:21.080]   how does this work because covered 19 is a 120 nanometer sized virus so Peter points
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.260]   out that like oh how can these you know simple pieces of cloth protect from that because
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:33.880]   they don't they have bigger holes in 120 nanometers the point Peter made though and is described
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:42.040]   again and again in all the research I've looked at is that covered 19 is spread through droplets
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   in other words you cough and it goes into your face right and specifically it goes into
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.920]   your eyes or it goes into your nose or goes into your mouth also talking sometimes I've
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:01.040]   noticed when I talk little bits of spit fly out I'm sure we're all like that so these
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:09.400]   are droplets and the droplets is what the mask catches so there are three categories
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.360]   of transmission described by virologists says contact transmission droplet transmission
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.760]   airborne transmission so contact is when you actually touch someone or something with the
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.240]   virus and this is a big issue if you touch you know we talked last week about sanitation
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.600]   if you touch a surface which somebody who is infected is touched also and then you touch
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:38.400]   your face that can get you sick what we're talking about for masks though is the coughing
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.640]   and talking which seems to be such a common vector for spread because that's actually
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:54.080]   how on the whole this particular virus is kind of expelled airborne is a nightmare airborne
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.120]   is when things they say it's a aerosol eyes that here into it they turn into an aerosol
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:05.240]   they float in the air and tiny tiny tiny like a sub remember the was point five micron droplets
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.300]   for ages that can actually happen in a hospital there are certain procedures in the hospital
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:18.880]   which cause the droplets to aerosol eyes and and the kinds of masks we're talking about
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.600]   the basic masks don't really help there so in a hospital setting where there's potential
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.580]   aerosolization you need the good masks so actually Oxford University just published
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:39.240]   today a new report about this where they described how basic masks are fine except for if you're
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:47.160]   in a hospital around an aerosol generating procedure or AGP and this is a list of AGPs
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:54.240]   so you're probably not doing these things at home right so so you're fine to use whatever
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   couple of layers of t-shirt right in the hospital even unless this is what the University of
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.640]   Oxford is saying from their research it's this is with COVID-19 research this is not
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:13.280]   just any old research so like basic masks homemade masks this is why the University
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:20.560]   we looked at earlier is asking for homemade masks even because they they do really help
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   so there's been a lot of research already empirical research showing that these basic
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.040]   marks acts basic masks actually help in practice for example for SARS so this is from slate
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.240]   star codex.com a summary of some research they have a link to a paper about SARS which
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:50.720]   looked at how folks that were wearing even surgical masks got no infections at all.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.260]   This is the Oxford study that I mentioned and so their conclusion again standard surgical
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.520]   masks can be used for most community-level clinical interactions let alone at home right
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.120]   so they were explicitly looking at home but we've seen from the other research that basic
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   materials are just as good as surgical masks or very close to.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.880]   The research empirical research has also found that basic masks do help in practice empirically
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:25.920]   in practice they do help in non-healthcare settings again not COVID-19 but swine flu
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.720]   when they looked at the result of a flight in which there were folks with swine flu on
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:40.520]   that flight those people that wore a basic mask were 0% that wore masks got sick compared
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:51.120]   to 35% of non-wearers got sick so there are huge differences when you use even basic masks.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.240]   This is totally in line with what virologists say so this virologist says COVID exposure
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.320]   dose matters this is really important kind of when you're thinking about the science
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:09.680]   here masks can help anyone because they reduce the amount of virus released or taken in and
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.880]   the immune system wants a low dose so if you keep the dose low and the virus has to divide
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.960]   many times to get to high levels and then the immune system's got lots of time to kick
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   in right so this is like kind of counterintuitive but this is actually what the data is now
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:32.360]   showing us and the science is now showing us is that the transmission of this virus seems
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:39.880]   to occur primarily through sustained exposure right so in Hong Kong and Singapore they define
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:47.400]   that as less than six feet away from somebody for at least 15 minutes in Hong Kong or 30
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.160]   minutes in Singapore right so this is super important for like understanding how this
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.360]   virus works it's not about just passing somebody in the street unless they cough on you but
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:12.120]   actually being around somebody for an extended period of time and close to them so a key
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:18.960]   point which we absolutely know now we've got plenty of data to show this now is that many
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.360]   people are infectious before they have symptoms so it's not okay just to wait until you're
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:29.960]   coughing before you start putting a mask on something like 50% of people with the virus
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:39.040]   are asymptomatic and they are spreading it even then so this is a key reason why you
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.000]   have to get the mask on early so these little pictures here is Peter is describing how when
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.040]   you wear a mask you stop other people from infecting you but you might be infected with
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.840]   have no idea you might never get symptoms right but you could be spreading it to your
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:01.920]   friends your family your community your co-workers without knowing it so you need to wear a mask
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.480]   for that reason as well so he describes this as a selfless motivation and this has been
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.160]   a key part of the messaging in the Czech Republic is this idea that is this is such a pro-social
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.680]   behavior to wear a mask because you are protecting the people in your community the people in
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.120]   your workplace so if we look at it we saw that graph earlier that showed there's quite
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:36.200]   a few countries now that are controlling this without a lockdown like Korea and in every
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.760]   country that that has controlled it without a lockdown or isn't in a lockdown anymore I
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:48.680]   should say they're doing four things they're doing rigorous testing they're doing rigorous
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:55.360]   contact tracing so if you're tested positive who's everybody you've you've been near they
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:03.240]   quarantine anybody who's found positive and everybody's wearing masks on you know on public
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.640]   transport at work you know anywhere they're around other people outside of their family
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:18.400]   so like from a data science point of view this is you know we don't need proof right
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:25.600]   none of these are economy destroying levels of cost right masks I mean it can make our
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.380]   own masks for like 10 cents so you know these are things that allow us to get the economy
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:39.120]   going again and avoid people dying so we save lives and potentially trillions of dollars
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.880]   and it's not this is not like some crazy idea that might just work this is something that
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.840]   lots of countries have done and it's already worked so it's like why isn't everybody doing
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.920]   this we need the lockdowns to order get to the point because so many countries like the
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.440]   US and the UK are way too late but you know in a few weeks or a few months once we're
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.320]   past the apex this is what we need to be doing and it's going to be super hard to do the
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.840]   masks bit because we're you know our governments have been stigmatizing this you know they're
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.280]   saying you don't need them if you wear a mask you're taking it away from from hospitals
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.560]   so there are now all these Asian countries that acted quickly to contain the virus and
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.280]   you actually look at like just the traffic on the streets they're kind of back to about
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.300]   normal so there's lots of data you can look at in this case this is Tom Tom traffic congestion
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:43.680]   right and it's just fascinating to look at these countries where the last seven days
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.800]   versus historical average this is from the Financial Times I believe sorry for accidentally
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:57.040]   cutting off the citation which I tried to keep you can see how there are countries that
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:05.920]   are nearly back to normal people are moving around again so Peter used you know used all
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:12.200]   that to try to get rid of the first idea which is we don't need masks we do need masks so
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.680]   that was his cross that off so the second argument he dealt with is there's no point
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:26.440]   saying you need masks because there are no masks so his point was well make them go and
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.640]   make masks and so here are pictures of people in the Czech Republic after this video came
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.680]   out making masks and hanging them up on mask trees for anybody to come and pick up that
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.520]   needs one and one of the things you notice here is the masks don't look professional
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.640]   and I think this is really important right because if you have a polka dot mask nobody's
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.300]   going to come up to you and say you're stealing you know professional hospital grade masks
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.440]   you know that they're they're cute and so part of the the Czech community reaction was
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:07.280]   to have like you know humor and you know just make it as fine as possible get everybody
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.920]   involved so even kids have their koala I don't know why there's koalas in Czech Republic
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:24.400]   I guess it's just are there on a visit who has its own mask there are all kinds of interesting
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:31.200]   things you could use for these masks so one chap pointed out that 3m has a household filter
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.480]   which costs 22 bucks and gives you enough for 60 masks and it is actually officially
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:42.680]   virus rated so you know if you want to go fancy you can spend 30 cents and cut those
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:48.840]   up as we've already noted things like cotton should be just fine too but yeah string staples
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.680]   and hot glue $22 worth of this stuff maybe a bit of cloth on each side to make it more
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:02.520]   comfortable so the the call to action that Peter made was basically he said I want everybody
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:09.040]   in the Czech Republic to wear a mask everybody 100% of the country which I mean that sounds
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.840]   crazy to me that that could be possible because at the time this was something that had a
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.440]   social stigma around it so he pointed out something really interesting which is that
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.760]   this would not be if this was successful it would not be the first time that something
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:28.600]   with a social stigma turned around just like in most western countries when I remember
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.000]   when I was growing up dogs would poop on the sidewalk and you would leave it there and
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.160]   he pointed out that we managed to change the social expectation that if a dog poops you
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.480]   pick it up and before that changed no question people would have been like oh my gosh you're
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.280]   picking up poop that's gross whereas now it's like excuse me you seem to have left your
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.560]   dogs fecal matter on the sidewalk please pick it up thank you very much so you know these
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:03.480]   things can change social expectations can change and so he his his hope was that if
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:09.440]   you see somebody without a mask you know people will stare at them and think who is this anti-social
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:19.860]   person so he made three particular asks he said share this video take a selfie wearing
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:26.360]   a mask and use the hashtag masks for all well actually the Czech version but let's pick
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.240]   the English version and influence influences should set a good example for their followers
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:38.780]   and so I think it'd be super cool if like you know celebrities started rocking their
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:44.000]   own homemade colorful masks maybe pictures of them making them themselves you know I
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:55.200]   mean I think that would be super important and you know the point is that this is little
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.440]   word cloud of like the most important values to folks in the Czech Republic and the biggest
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.960]   one was kindness and so he is saying like this is this is the most kind thing you can
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   do is to have a little bit of inconvenience yourself in order to protect those around
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:19.940]   you oh my god it was successful so today when politicians appear in public they're all rocking
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:27.480]   masks people are putting mask pictures on the public transport on the statues it's it's
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:38.400]   extraordinary so there's a lot of recommendations out there for face masks Michael in who is
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:48.000]   a biochem researcher has lots of great information that we can share similar kind of stuff what
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:58.120]   we've described about but some some more links actually a article that just came out today
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.280]   we might need to update this is that actually this looks correct so he's actually already
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:12.480]   got a new thing if you put a mask in the oven at 160 Fahrenheit 70 centigrade for 30 minutes
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.300]   it sterilizes it and you can use it again as much as you like no alcohol so there's
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:26.120]   actually a new Harvard study I just saw today which actually has has has shown this interestingly
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.400]   you can see this is coming from a ways in QQ you know Chinese sites a lot of the best
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.440]   information we have is coming from Chinese sites because they're the ones with the you
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:43.080]   know months months more experience of this so a really interesting thing that appears
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:49.860]   all the time in like the training that doctors talk about for mask fitting is if you want
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.840]   to know if your masks working pretty well go somewhere like get something smelly like
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.560]   some sugary water or some smoke or something and see if you can still smell it with your
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:08.240]   mask on and if you if it's if you can smell it a lot less then you're blocking the particles
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:16.120]   so that's kind of the rule of thumb that you keep I keep seeing people talking about okay
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:26.120]   so that is what I wanted to say about masks I guess you know I I'm not a big YouTube influencer
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:31.400]   thought leader whatever I'm just a data scientist but I guess my job is to look at data and
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:39.840]   try to figure out what it says and the data is super super clear on this it's not like
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.520]   there's no 100% perfect proof randomized controlled trial for this exact illness disease such
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.440]   a thing would be impossible because it hasn't really been around long enough you can't really
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.560]   do a randomized controlled trial where you say hey you're not allowed to use a mask and
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:03.800]   you are but from a kind of a Bayesian prior perspective the evidence is so incredibly
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.760]   strong that this is a good idea the cost is so low the upside is so huge in terms of lives
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:17.840]   saved and the economy being able to get back up and running again it seems like madness
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:25.920]   to me not to do this so I will repeat Peters cold arms here and say let's make this happen
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.840]   and particularly you know let's see influences come out wearing masks start start making
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.360]   masks we're going to have links with this video to how to make them at home it's very
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:46.520]   cheap it's very easy and let's hope that we can make happen in the US and the UK and other
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.960]   countries what the what the Czech folks have done so incredibly well
