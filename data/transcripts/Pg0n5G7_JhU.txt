[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   what makes teeth white and will supporting the oral microbiome make our teeth whiter yeah and
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.800]   by the way there are some folks out there whose teeth need to be less white in my opinion agree
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.780]   totally agree now we're being somewhat facetious but not really um but i think most people would
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.780]   like to have teeth that are uh would be uh characterized as mostly white yeah we want to
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.400]   look good i mean i appreciate and respect that i do think we've moved a little away from reality
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.120]   with some of that so i agree with you i think there's there are um teeth out there that could
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.060]   could not be quite so bright but you do you i think everyone should do what makes them happy
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.100]   so what makes teeth white so interestingly if you look at a baby tooth next to an adult tooth and i
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.640]   get this call all of the time from parents so the child loses their first baby tooth the adult tooth
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.320]   starts to come in and adult teeth are quite a bit darker than baby teeth which are very white and
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.900]   bright and they're worried what's wrong with my child's teeth they're so yellow that's actually
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.620]   a very natural shade of enamel and why is that it all has to do with that crystalline structure in the
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.320]   mineralization so baby teeth are less mineralized and the crystalline structure is a little more
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.580]   haphazardly arranged it's not quite as organized so instead of like lincoln logs lined up it's more like
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.220]   pickup sticks to some degree why is that baby teeth are meant to resorb dissolve and fall out okay so this is why
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.520]   baby teeth are also much more susceptible to decay so the whiteness is coming how the light reflects
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.420]   and refracts off the teeth which is a lot of times while you why you hear if you use hydroxyapatite
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.940]   or even coconut oil is changing the surface surface modification so it's changing the way light reflects
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.940]   and refracts off that tooth to make it seem whiter and brighter now certainly with adult teeth if you're
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.280]   using bleaching agents you know hydrogen peroxide or um carbon mine peroxide some of the stronger
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.240]   bleaching that's actually penetrating into the tooth and changing the structure pulling out stain do people
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.860]   do that they gargle with hydrogen peroxide well they do bleaching trays essentially um i don't well people
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.120]   will rinse with hydrogen peroxide yes and it will make your teeth brighter and whiter but i'm telling you
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.940]   it's going to do a number on your oral microbiome so i suggest it very in a very limited fashion the only
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.940]   time i ever had a bad canker sore was because i gargled with um 50 water 50 hydro hydrogen peroxide
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.600]   because an acupuncturist recommended it i he looked at my tongue and then he said you should do that you
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.340]   know and then i did that and then you know four or five days later i had this like you know nickel sized
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.120]   canker sore on the roof of my mouth and i was like oh and um i will say and i have no product
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   affiliation whatsoever but um to any any specific products by but by switching to hydroxyapatite
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   containing toothpaste my teeth they definitely have gotten whiter i drink a lot of yeah yerba mate and
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.120]   coffee and um and i brush but that that was it it was it was sort of a progressive issue of my teeth
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.780]   dimming um so that's been been great i also used to get cavities fairly often when i was a kid we i'll
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.100]   talk about that a little bit later um but since switching to hydroxyapatite toothpaste i've had like
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.200]   stellar um dental reviews assuming my dentist is looking carefully i believe he is but we'll see
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.900]   and to me it just makes so much more sense like give teeth the mineral that they normally use to re
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.800]   mineralize um it just makes sense like it's biomimetic it depends on how you look at life
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.820]   i think i prefer biomimetic materials personally it's again it's a personal choice but i agree with
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.220]   you my patients who have switched to hydroxyapatite and i'd like to point out not all hydroxyapatite
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.520]   toothpaste are the same it depends on sourcing and the other ingredients that are in there but
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.620]   generally speaking their teeth look healthier stronger whiter and brighter they're they just
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.560]   look more nourished more hydrated their microbiomes look more balanced too you're talking about kids
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.840]   and the fact that sometimes if their teeth are a little bit yellow that's normal one thing um that
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.760]   i've been really struck by as the discussion around longevity seems more and more prominent these days
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.180]   is um occasionally i'll run into somebody who's in their 70s or 80s um even 90s and it's very rare
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.120]   to encounter somebody in their 80s or 90s whose teeth are not like the color of this tea and for those that
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.500]   are listening it's like a very dark brown um i've never seen somebody unless they're doing something
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:49.840]   highly artificial with bleaching um i've never seen somebody 75 or older whose teeth aren't basically
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.800]   yellow to brown darker and when you look at people when they're very close to death their teeth often
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.760]   look uh very opaque uh what is that is that a blood flow issue is it um what's going on there yeah it can
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.340]   be a zero stoma dry mouth so we definitely lose salivary capabilities as we age very likely more
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.580]   mouth breathing so mouth breathers will tend to have darker teeth because the teeth desiccate they dry
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.680]   out and over time you will experience mineral loss um decades and decades of coffee tea wine will do it
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.060]   too well i don't drink the wine but i'm definitely coffee tea since i was a little kid i've been drinking
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.240]   bata since i was like five it's good yeah it's delicious yeah gotta live life yeah but um yeah
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.080]   and so they're and they they're losing minerals too you know over time your teeth take a beating i mean
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.060]   they're we're living to be a hundred now that's a long time to maintain this non-shedding surface in
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.560]   our body you know so um and then it depends on the generation too but some some generations especially
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.580]   as you mentioned 70s 80s i'd wonder about tetracycline exposures when there's certain
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.140]   antibiotics that we don't use anymore that can um were known to darken the teeth which is why they
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.700]   pulled them from common prescription
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.900]   which is why they're living to darken the teeth which is why they're living to darken the teeth which is why they're
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.000]   living to darken the teeth which is why they're living to darken the teeth which is why they're living to darken the teeth
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.200]   which is why they're living to darken the teeth which is why they're living to darken the teeth which is why they're living to darken the teeth
