[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   On March 6, 2019, I released a podcast episode entitled "Federal Debt, the Ticking Bomb
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.800]   that No One is Willing to Diffuse."
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.560]   It was episode 628 of the podcast.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.000]   The following day, March 7, 2019, I released episode 629, which was called "In-Depth
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.760]   Version, Federal Debt, the Ticking Bomb that No One is Willing to Diffuse."
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.600]   I explained very carefully and in great detail the exact numbers of the fiscal situation
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   in the United States.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   I closed those podcast episodes by explaining to you why I was actually taking so much time
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   to explain it.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.940]   I explained to you that it's my opinion that inevitably the U.S. government will default
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.800]   on its obligations.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.640]   And by the way, default happens in various forms.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000]   I think the United States will continue to be strong, continue to be successful, but
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100]   it will default on its obligations.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940]   But I explained to you why that's not a crazy outlandish theory.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.460]   And I said, "Here is what the government will need to do in order to bring its financial
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.400]   situation back into a position of fiscal sustainability."
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   I explained the numbers of exactly what you would need to see.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.600]   That was four years ago that I made that podcast episode.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.140]   And I thought it would be useful here, four years later, to talk about the improvements
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.480]   in the situation.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.220]   Hopefully you just fell off your chair laughing.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.360]   Short story is there are no improvements.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.320]   Everything has gotten worse over these intervening four years.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.100]   Of course, we've faced the COVID crisis and all kinds of things that have gotten worse.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.160]   And in that episode I quoted extensively from Brian Riedel from the Manhattan Institute
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.020]   his paper called "A Comprehensive Federal Budget Plan to Avert a Debt Crisis."
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.000]   And in today's episode I want to begin with some comments from a recent op-ed that he
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.660]   wrote in the New York Times because he gives a good and accurate look, a very short and
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.680]   accurate look at the current numbers facing the US-American situation.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.480]   The op-ed was entitled, published February 21, 2023, entitled "Biden's Promises on Social
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.100]   Security and Medicare Have No Basis in Reality."
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.040]   In his State of the Union speech this month, President Biden pledged to block any reductions
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.280]   in scheduled Social Security and Medicare benefits.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.760]   He also promised that any tax increases would be limited to families that earn more than
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   $400,000, roughly the top-earning 2% of American families.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.280]   Together, these promises are almost certainly economically impossible.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.680]   Over the next three decades, the Social Security system is scheduled to pay benefits $21 trillion
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.980]   greater than its trust fund will collect in payroll taxes and related revenues.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.120]   The Medicare system is projected to run a $48 trillion shortfall.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.600]   These deficits are projected to, in turn, produce $47 trillion in interest payments
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.540]   to the national debt.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.200]   That is a combined shortfall of $116 trillion, according to data from the Congressional Budget
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Office.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.440]   The inflation-adjusted figures trim by roughly one-third.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   These unsustainable figures result from demographics, rising health care costs, and program design.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.920]   The ratio of workers supporting each retiree, which was about 5 to 1 back in 1960, will
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.680]   fall to just over 2 to 1 by the next decade.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.320]   People who live until age 90, a fast-growing group, will spend one-third of their adult
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.480]   life collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.920]   Today's typical retiring couple will receive Medicare benefits three times as large as
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.360]   their lifetime contributions to the system, and also will come out ahead on Social Security,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.320]   adjusted into present value, according to the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   Now, pay very careful attention to the next paragraph I'm going to read to you.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.960]   I'm going to read it slowly so that you can follow the numbers in an audio format.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.520]   Pay careful attention.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.400]   The President's implication that full benefits can be paid without raising taxes for 98%
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.920]   of families has no basis in mathematical reality.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.480]   Imagine that Congress let the Trump tax cuts expire, applied Social Security taxes to all
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:42.280]   wages, doubled the top two tax brackets to 70 and 74%, hiked investment taxes, imposed
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:52.320]   Senator Bernie Sanders' 8% wealth tax on assets over $10 billion, and 77% estate tax
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.160]   on estates valued at more than $1 billion, and raised the corporate tax rate back to
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.040]   35%.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   Combined federal income state and payroll marginal tax rates would approach 100% for
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.520]   wealthy taxpayers, and America would face among the highest wealth, estate, and corporate
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.760]   tax rates in the developed world.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:32.960]   Yet, total new tax revenue, 4% of GDP, would still fall short of Social Security and Medicare
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:46.080]   shortfalls that will grow to 6% of GDP over the next three decades, not even having the
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.560]   defense budget would close the remaining gap.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.080]   More realistically, if these programs aren't reformed, the middle class will have to shoulder
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.280]   the burden, just as they do across Europe.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.440]   And the burden is massive.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.540]   Closing with taxes the aforementioned Social Security and Medicare shortfalls would more
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.960]   plausibly mean raising the payroll tax by 9 percentage points and imposing a 20% value
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.120]   added tax.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.440]   Taxes haven't been raised that dramatically since World War II, back when tax revenues
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:32.560]   consumed a much smaller share of our economy and there were many more untapped revenue
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.240]   sources.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.280]   If such tax increases sound painful, Congress could close as much as two-thirds of the Social
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.840]   Security and Medicare shortfalls by increasing program eligibility ages and paring back the
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.960]   growth of benefits for non-poor retirees, according to my research at the Manhattan
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.280]   Institute.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.880]   Perhaps the President assumes the federal government can just borrow $116 trillion over
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.760]   three decades, on top of the current roughly $25 trillion in federal debt held by the public.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.200]   But who will lend the government this much money?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.400]   China and Japan are already paring back their roughly $2 trillion in American debt holdings.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.880]   It seems unlikely that other countries would step up to take on much more.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.760]   The Federal Reserve is trying to reduce its own more than $5 trillion in Treasury holdings
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   that temporarily soared during the pandemic, and cannot monetize $100 trillion in debt
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.880]   without hyperinflation.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.240]   That leaves America's banks, corporations, and investors, which almost surely lack both
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.280]   the capacity and willingness to lend $100 trillion to a government that cannot control
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.460]   its own finances.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.320]   At some point, the bond market will likely tap out, forcing Congress to finally confront
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.360]   its soaring deficits.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.800]   The danger is that waiting for a debt crisis will make the inevitable reforms so much more
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.040]   drastic and painful.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.180]   At that point, retired baby boomers will be too old to absorb benefit changes.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.820]   The bloated national debt will bring colossal interest costs, and years of automatic benefit
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.560]   expansions will be even more politically difficult to pare back.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.780]   The responsible alternative would bring Democrats and Republicans together and put everything
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.580]   on the table – Social Security, Medicare, taxes, and defense – to build a balanced
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:33.560]   solution that gradually phases in reforms and exempts low-income seniors while we still
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.360]   have time for this gentler solution.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.440]   Social Security and Medicare sustainability is not merely a future challenge.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   Their annual program shortfalls – forecasted to rise from $426 billion to $2 trillion over
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.400]   the next decade – are the main driver of budget deficits, expected to head well past
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.960]   $2 trillion in a decade.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.440]   Social Security and Medicare are vitally important programs that represent a commitment between
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.700]   generations.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:09.840]   No White House has seriously entertained addressing their unsustainable costs since the 2011 deficit
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   negotiations.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.880]   Back then, Vice President Joe Biden courageously put all taxes and spending on the table in
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.060]   hopes of a grand deal on deficits.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.880]   With the Social Security and Medicare trust funds headed toward insolvency within 11 years,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.280]   that courage is needed again.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.360]   And thus concludes Brian Riedel's Op-Ed from two days ago.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.800]   I don't have a ton to say on this subject because my major intent is simply to keep
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.880]   you informed.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.280]   In terms of solutions, I have none.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.800]   There really aren't any.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.100]   When you look at it, it's a fairly simple situation.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.380]   Either you have to increase government revenue, increase the income for the government, or
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.860]   you have to decrease the expenses.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.280]   And so, as I see it, there are four basic options.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.740]   And these are the only four that I can come up with that will eventually be a pathway
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.420]   out of this situation.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.620]   Option number one is raise taxes or government fees.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.140]   The sources of revenue to a government are taxes, government fees, and inflation.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.140]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.700]   But it's taxes and government fees.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.620]   So you have to either raise taxes or government fees.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:36.860]   In terms of how to raise taxes, there are a couple of basic ways to raise taxes.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.620]   Number one way is you can increase the rates of tax.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.980]   The taxes are charged at increased tax rates.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.580]   So you were going to be charged 35%.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.420]   Now you're going to be charged 45%.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.820]   That's the way, number one.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.740]   A second way to raise taxes is to increase the base, the tax base that is charged on.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.940]   So for example, right now, Social Security and Medicare wage base is, what's it, $120
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.940]   something thousand dollars?
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.800]   Just a little bit, somewhere in that range.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.060]   And so that amount can be increased.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.700]   You could say, well, all of your wages are now subject to Social Security taxes.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.060]   And so previously you were making $400,000 a year and you were paying Social Security
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.580]   and Medicare taxes, employment taxes, on $100 something thousand.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.380]   But now we're going to charge that on $400,000.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.380]   So there's a major tax increase, but they didn't change the rates.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.060]   They changed the base, the wage base.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.600]   Alternatively, the government, in order to raise taxes, can impose new taxes.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.920]   So you saw this with various, you see this with various surcharge taxes and special taxes
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.020]   that get levied on certain activities.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.740]   Those are the three basic ways that you can increase taxes, is number one, increase the
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.740]   rates.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.220]   Number two, change and increase the tax base.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.700]   And then number three, impose new forms of taxes.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.500]   Or you can raise government fees.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.260]   And so for some services that government provides, the government can charge fees.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.300]   This is negligible in the modern age, but it can be done.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.900]   So either the country can raise taxes or government fees, or number two, you can lower government
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.900]   spending.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:22.320]   So the government can choose to lower spending and say consciously, "We're going to reduce
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.980]   our spending."
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.100]   This is different than default, which is number four, but reduction of spending would say,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.540]   "This year we were planning to spend a trillion dollars on this government program, but what
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.900]   we're going to do is we're going to cut that budget and beginning three years from now,
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.820]   we're going to spend $500 billion on this government program."
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.020]   So you can lower government spending.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.340]   The third thing that you can do is inflate the currency.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:55.220]   So when you inflate the currency, it allows government to satisfy its technical obligations
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.060]   to say, "Look, we paid our bills."
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.340]   But because you're paying those bills with inflated currency, you're getting a discount
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.780]   versus what you would have had to pay if the currency had not inflated.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.700]   And then number four is you can default on obligations.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.460]   Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:17.260]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.740]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere from King of the Hammers to Uncle
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.540]   Ned's Backcountry Rally, you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.140]   a championship winner.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.220]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.820]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.820]   Offer in soon.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.340]   See dealer for details.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.020]   And default can take many forms.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.540]   So it can take the most drastic form when a government just doesn't make its interest
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   payments on its debt.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.700]   I think that's unlikely for the United States, but it has happened all around the world with
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.820]   many governments all around the world.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.420]   They just simply flat out default.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.660]   They don't pay the interest payments on the bonds that they owe.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.040]   Default can take other forms as well.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.780]   So default can include things like raising the age of retirement.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.060]   When you started working as a 20-year-old worker, you were promised that at age 65 you
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.180]   would be able to retire.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:17.900]   But now the laws have changed and you have been promised that now your age of retirement
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.340]   is now 75.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:26.020]   I consider this to be a form of default because it's a changing or renegotiation of promises.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.180]   There are other forms of default that are also again softer.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:35.460]   So a number of years ago on the podcast I profiled an extensive article on Medicaid
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.840]   beneficiaries in Maine.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.300]   And these are people who are entitled to government benefits to pay for their health care.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:48.000]   The problem is quite simply the rates that the government is willing to pay to nurses
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.140]   to provide the care.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:57.320]   The market conditions do not make it possible for there to be health care workers available
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.840]   on those systems.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.540]   And so although technically the government says, "We'll write the checks," there's
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.140]   no one who wants to work and there's no one willing to do it.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:10.100]   And so the person who is eligible for benefits doesn't get those benefits.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.500]   And this is again another form of default.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.900]   There are other things as well.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.780]   Basically default means government renegotiating its commitments, changing the terms of the
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780]   alleged contract.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.020]   Because there is no contract.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.980]   Remember that what the government says and does is not a bilateral contract.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.980]   They're not obligated to do it.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.420]   It's a unilateral agreement where they set up a program and they say, "This is what
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.500]   we're going to do."
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.040]   And then if they want to change it 10 years later, they change it.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.300]   And other than a ballot, a vote in the ballot box to vote for one representative over another
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.820]   representative, you have no say in the matter.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.020]   You can't affect it or change it.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.940]   So those are the options, right?
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:55.260]   In order for the United States government to deal with its fiscal problems, or any government,
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.020]   they have the option to, number one, raise taxes or government fees.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.940]   Number two, lower government spending.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.260]   Number three, inflate the currency.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.260]   Number four, default on obligations.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.940]   And so you say, "Well, what's going to happen?"
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.160]   None of us know.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.060]   We are in genuinely uncharted territory.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.500]   We don't know.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:17.060]   And what I find very difficult is while the fiscal situation of the US government is bad,
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.100]   it is by no means worse than many other governments in the world.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   There are many, many major leading governments that are in far worse shape.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:33.380]   Simultaneously, while the US fiscal situation is bad, the US economic situation is better
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.300]   than, again, virtually anywhere else in the world.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.740]   And so I myself don't know how to reconcile this paradox.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   All I know, what I believe, is that the fiscal situation is a separate and while connected,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.740]   it's not a directly influential force on an economic situation.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:01.420]   The fiscal situation does matter, but the economic situation is a separate animal.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.340]   And so I don't try to connect them.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.940]   I recognize that they influence one another, but I don't try to connect them directly and
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.140]   say that because the US fiscal situation is bad, that that automatically means that the
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.060]   US economy is heading into the tank.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.540]   To me, that's an unwarranted claim.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.780]   What can you do to protect yourself?
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.620]   Well, the first thing you can do is be informed.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.660]   That's why I'm trying to inform you about the situation.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.500]   If you understand the facts, the mathematical facts, without even touching on things like
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.780]   the whole concept of trust fund, right?
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.780]   There is no trust fund.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.220]   It doesn't, the money doesn't exist.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.700]   It's a bunch of IOUs traded between government entities.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.180]   There's no money.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.940]   It's all made up in the first place.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.940]   So first is understand.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.700]   Understand that no matter what the politicians say, the politicians are trying to get elected
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.140]   and gain power.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.300]   The math is undeniable.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.220]   It's inescapable.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.220]   And the math is devastatingly bad.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:07.700]   So as once you know it, then you can press forward and provide for your own solutions.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.740]   As I see it, that's the starting place.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.660]   So be informed about the situation.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:19.220]   And that none of the policies or proposals that I see recommended currently are in any
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.020]   way mathematically sound.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.580]   You hear someone say, "I'm going to come out."
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.700]   Or you hear that the government just changed something and they increased it by 1%.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   Just ignore it.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.700]   It's all noise.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:37.100]   If at some point in time you get a bipartisan collaborative effort to make significant changes
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.020]   on government spending or on these programs, pay attention.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.460]   And then go and look for an appropriate analyst who will look and say, "What kind of impact
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   do these make?"
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.660]   Again, I find Brian Riedel to be an extraordinarily knowledgeable, useful analyst.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.020]   And he has plenty of information available for those who wish to dig into the numbers.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.260]   So if something like that comes along, great.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:07.500]   But as you heard in the paragraph that I read in his op-ed, and as you heard in the podcast
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:14.100]   episodes four years ago, these proposals need to be very, very significant in order to move
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.580]   the needle in a meaningful way.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.580]   So pay attention.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:23.980]   Number two, don't expect any government promise to be there for you.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.900]   It'll be nice if they are.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.500]   And if you're 70 years old, file for Social Security and take it, obviously.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:40.660]   But if you are 40 years old, don't expect the government to hold good on its promises.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:47.580]   Which means you have a responsibility to provide for yourself those things that previous generations
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.220]   voted that the government would take care of them for themselves.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   What are they?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.360]   Well, the big ones are health and health care.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:01.340]   You have a responsibility to take care of your health so that you will be in good health
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.020]   in your old age.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.380]   Remember that Medicare and Medicaid are not health care programs.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.740]   They are health cost payment programs.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:19.380]   Getting access to Medicare and Medicaid is not going to be the key thing that helps you
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.740]   to be healthy.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:26.740]   No question that they can pay for many things that will help you to enjoy a stronger quality
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.740]   of life.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.860]   But you need to focus first and foremost on developing and maintaining your physical health.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.960]   That's the fundamental thing to begin with.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:44.140]   So if you go into old age as somebody who has lots and lots of health conditions and
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.900]   is dependent upon a government program to gain access to a doctor and gain access to
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.820]   a doctor, there's a very strong chance that you're going to die much earlier than
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.420]   otherwise you would.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.940]   But if you're someone who goes into old age in vigorous personal health, able to enjoy
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:05.780]   all of the benefits of good sound health, being free of sickness and disease, etc.,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.940]   then you can enjoy your old age regardless of what government programs are doing or not
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.940]   doing.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:21.860]   So we all have a basic limit to our experience of life and genetic potential and health history,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.860]   etc.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.300]   But today you should be focusing on maximizing your personal health to the highest degree
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   possible.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:35.780]   Assume that you're not going to receive any health care from others and recognize
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.180]   that you need to care for your own health.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.860]   That's to me the fundamental thing.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:48.180]   Related to that, with regard to government income from government pensions, be it social
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:53.940]   security or be it other forms of government pensions, just pretend that those things don't
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.940]   exist.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.180]   I don't think it's warranted to discard 100% of it.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.580]   To me that seems extremist.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.060]   I wouldn't tell somebody who has a military pension, "Oh you should just pretend you
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.060]   don't have one."
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.340]   No, to me that's silly.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.580]   Social security is much more questionable, but again I think there will always be some
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:21.340]   expression of social security because our entire country in the United States has systematically
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.220]   – number one, we accepted and voted for these programs, we voted for the politicians
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:30.980]   who established them, and they've become so interwoven in the American fabric that
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.860]   this is a fundamental part of what it means to be American, is to have access to these
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:40.860]   welfare programs that there's no serious politician or no widely accepted politician
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:47.140]   who is seriously running on the idea of discarding these things.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.540]   So if you're a hardcore libertarian, no government programs, no welfare programs,
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.740]   it's a pipe dream.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   Get out of here.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.740]   It's not going to work.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.740]   It's silly.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.940]   I'm with you ideologically, but practically there's no point in even talking about
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.940]   it.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:07.500]   These programs are here to stay, but they're not going to be as significant to most beneficiaries
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   as they once were.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.140]   There's going to be some form of default.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.700]   So you're going to be expected – you're not going to retire at 65 or 70 years old.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.940]   You're going to be expected to work from 70 to 80 and then file for social security,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.020]   etc.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.420]   And in order for that to be successful, you will need to accomplish a couple of personal
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   things.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.260]   One, you need to increase your personal health so that you can work effectively.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.180]   Number two, you need to pay careful attention to your career choices and you need to choose
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.960]   a career into which you can grow and flourish for the long term.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.780]   And so that career should have a few basic features.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.860]   Number one, it should not be a career that's physically damaging to your body.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.500]   It should not be a career that grinds you down and you're going to reach 50 years
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.980]   old and you can't do it anymore physically.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.700]   So if you're in a career that is grinding down your body, dump it.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:05.340]   Number two, it should not be a career in which you will be subject to heavy, unrelenting
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.280]   pressures of ageism.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.840]   The most accepted forms of discrimination in the United States today involve discrimination
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.660]   based on age, ageism, discrimination against the young and the very young and discrimination
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.820]   against the old and the very old.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.380]   And so recognize that you, as you age, are going to face significant levels of discrimination
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:35.020]   and you need to make sure that your career is one in which your wisdom and your judgment
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:41.620]   and your skills and your faculties, etc. will become more valuable as you age rather than
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.060]   less valuable.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:49.380]   A career that involves you being able to use your physical body and be stronger and have
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:55.340]   better eye-hand coordination, etc., this is not a career that has a good long-term potential
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340]   for you.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.380]   On the other hand, a career that involves perspective, judgment, wisdom, etc., is a
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.660]   career that does have a long-term potential for you.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.540]   So there's plenty of time for you to orient yourself and orient your long-term career
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:17.220]   thinking in the direction of something that you will succeed with until you're very, very
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.340]   old.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.940]   Another important component of your career choice needs to be for you to choose a career
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:31.000]   that you find personally fascinating with the goal of being engaged in it over a long
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.820]   period of time.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.640]   And there are many careers that are so vast in their scope that you can press forward
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.020]   and continue to learn and develop other things and explore other aspects of it.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.860]   You don't want to have a career that maybe if you're not mastered it today, let's say
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.020]   you're 40 years old and you look down and you recognize that at the age of 50 I'm going
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.860]   to have mastered this career and there's going to be nothing left for me to learn.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.100]   Well, that's a problem.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.900]   So now you need to create something that's going to put in place for you a 30 or a 40
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.460]   or a 50-year learning scope so you can be engaged with it and interested in it and be
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.820]   challenged in your career in a significant way.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.860]   So those are some things you can consider on the income side because the most obvious
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:21.940]   way to thrive when government pensions are breaking down is for you to have private sources
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.980]   of income.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.780]   Work is the most reliable way for you to handle that.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.820]   On the expense side of things, you want to take careful thought for how you can protect
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.380]   yourself against needing a lot of money.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.820]   I've already mentioned health care expenses, which wind up being a significant factor in
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.020]   most retirees' budgets.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.180]   And if Medicare or Medicaid or other, whatever the replacement government programs are, if
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.700]   those programs are insufficient to pay for your health care expenses, then you need an
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   alternative.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.020]   And again, I've emphasized, do everything you can to achieve and maintain the highest
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:09.460]   personal level of health possible to minimize your need for physicians or medical intervention.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.580]   You also want to control your other personal expenses so that you have money available
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.220]   to purchase outright and directly the kinds of medical care and intervention that you
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.460]   need.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:27.940]   So put yourself in a situation where your need for money is much less significant.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.420]   Most of us have an actual need for money that is very low.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.100]   But what we do is we make lifestyle choices that result in our needing higher amounts
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.100]   of money.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.980]   And so it's important that you recognize these are choices.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.660]   These are choices that we make.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:49.460]   We could live very comfortably in a simple one-room cabin on a little parcel of land
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:55.760]   somewhere with very, very modest expenses as an individual or as a couple.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.200]   We could live that way.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.720]   But most of us don't choose to live that way.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:07.140]   So you might want to have multiple plans that result in your being able to live a life of
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.420]   very low expenses if you needed or wanted to.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:18.540]   I consider it a sign of weakness for a man to not be able to adapt very comfortably to
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.360]   multiple lifestyles.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.180]   If you're in a situation where you just have to spend the amount of money you spend right
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.100]   now and there's no way to do it, I cannot possibly spend less than $15,000 a month,
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.020]   then that's a sign of weakness.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.820]   Strength means that you can live very well on $15,000 a month and you can live very well
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.300]   on $1,500 a month and you can live well on $150,000 a month.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:48.340]   As human beings, we can adapt both up and down the scale of hedonism.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:54.220]   And what I think is a very rewarding thing to do is to create multiple lifestyles in
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:00.060]   your mind that you would be very content and happy living.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.980]   And find your version of that.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:08.620]   To me, if I had a little cabin or if I lived in a little RV or something like that, just
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.460]   the amount of intellectual goals and hobbies that I have that are unfulfilled are things
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:22.060]   that could occupy me very happily for years and years and yet cost no money.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.520]   And so I could happily live in a little one-room apartment somewhere or a little studio somewhere.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:34.360]   Maybe I'm taking care of, living in my RV, watching A Christmas Tree a lot during the
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:40.320]   season to make a little money or maybe I'm a building super.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.000]   I become the little old guy that sits at the front of an apartment building and says, "Welcome,"
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.560]   and make sure that everything's okay with the building.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.980]   But give me a stack of books.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.000]   Maybe you want to learn math and you just are frustrated and upset so you buy yourself
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.400]   a stack of math textbooks that you're going to spend five years working through or reading
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.960]   all the classics or whatever your version of that is or mastering anything that you're
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   interested in, but mastering it.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.720]   And in our modern world, you can live well on little money.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.160]   And so put yourself in a situation where you can do that.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.760]   In addition, I think you should think very carefully about family structure and about
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.760]   community.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.720]   Again, my ambition when I'm old is basically the same as what my dad has always said.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.200]   He's like, "If I can't live well alone, just give me a tiny little bedroom in your house
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.240]   and I'll be happy."
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   To me, that's the thing as well.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   At this point, I have five children.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   Assuming my children survive to adulthood, if I have a little room in my children's houses
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.880]   and I bounce around among them, I'm happy as a clam.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:46.340]   And to me, the importance of community is a very important thing for you to consider.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.840]   So that may involve having children.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:55.080]   If you don't have children, then you need to pay very careful attention to how you can
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.360]   build and cultivate that community.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.320]   It takes years to build community and you're going to need to build community across generational
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.560]   boundaries.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.400]   You can't just be friends with a bunch of people who are your age because when you're
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.120]   all old and half your friends are dead, you need someone who's going to care for you.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.400]   So you need younger friends, which means you're going to need to find people to sow into and
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.200]   mentor and care for, etc.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.620]   I don't think that children are the guarantee to community in your old age.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.240]   Those without children can do that, but you do need to be intentional.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.120]   You need to be intentional about finding young people and mentoring them and loving them
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.520]   and sowing into their lives.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:40.160]   And with luck, they'll reciprocate and care for you as you age.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:47.440]   The growth of government welfare programs has enabled many of us to walk away from the
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.040]   community binds that sustained us in the past.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.960]   Being a single man or a single woman in the world has only truly become possible with
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.080]   the growth of welfare to provide for you.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:10.680]   So if welfare is under attack and welfare is not working as well as it once did, that's
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:17.280]   where it will be increasingly important to provide for yourself and also to revert to
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.840]   the ancient practices of living in community.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.940]   So you want to develop that.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.240]   If you have children, you need to make sure that you have a relationship with those children
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.680]   that will stand the test of time.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.540]   And if your children watch you not care for your parents, then there's a good chance
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.760]   that you have modeled for them what they're going to do for you.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.560]   If you don't have a close and warm relationship where they want to be with you, there's a
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.200]   good chance that they're not going to want to be with you.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.800]   And so as a parent, it should be an important focus for us to focus on building those values
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:56.320]   and developing the relationship with our children so that in our old age and potentially in
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:06.600]   our poverty, we have the ability to live out our years in love and in community.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:12.200]   With regard to other things, I think it behooves you to make backup plans.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.720]   And so I've talked a lot about backup plans.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:22.240]   Remember that these particular issues that we've discussed are primarily related to the
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.080]   country of the United States, the fiscal situation of the United States.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:33.040]   And so I think it makes sense to diversify out of one specific country.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.240]   And again, this is hard because I believe that of any country in the world, the United
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.120]   States probably has the best potential future.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.960]   But I think it makes sense for you to not be reliant on one country.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.800]   And so if you're a high income earner and you expect taxes to increase, you obviously
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.180]   want to do everything you can to protect against that with normal traditional financial planning.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.880]   And I think you'd protect against that by being able to escape the US tax net entirely.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:04.480]   I don't expect there to be large and significant changes in US taxation broadly.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.300]   It's my opinion.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   It's a studied opinion.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.480]   I have arguments for it, but it's my opinion that the US government won't make significant
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.560]   changes with regard to tax collection.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.600]   And primarily, I think this is due to simply market pressures.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:26.200]   And in an increasingly mobile world, and in a world where there are much, much lower tax
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.560]   jurisdictions, I think that if the US government increased its tax collections beyond what
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.680]   it is now, there would be increasing levels of pressure and increasing amounts of people
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.080]   just simply leaving and escaping the US tax jurisdiction.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:49.480]   The US government, I think, has done a remarkable job of dialing in its spot on the Laffer curve.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:56.120]   The Laffer curve is the curve that illustrates where the optimal level of tax collection.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.740]   You want to tax your citizens as much as you can in order to receive the maximum revenue,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.800]   but not tax them so much that they actually do something different and leave and go somewhere
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.120]   else or change their behavior in order to minimize taxation.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.040]   And I think the US has pretty well dialed that in.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:20.060]   And so I think that if they increase tax rates much or made big changes other than the small
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:25.160]   changes they always make at the margin of satisfied political support, then I think
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.440]   that they would lose tax revenue significantly.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.120]   But I always want to have a backup plan.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.880]   And so I want to make sure that I have the ability to go leave the United States, go
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.860]   to another place if that were smart for my business, etc.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.560]   And so you can think about that and engage in international planning.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.960]   By the way, internationalescapeplan.com is your starting point.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.560]   I have a course on this and most of the course is dedicated to a plan B. It's not dedicated
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.800]   to saying, "I'm going to teach you how to leave the United States and move to Dubai
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   today."
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.440]   It's more about, "Wouldn't you like to have a backup plan?"
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.960]   Although I don't live in the United States at the moment myself, I think that it's very
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.720]   probable that I myself will return to the United States in coming years.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.280]   Because I think economically and etc., I think the United States has the most to offer from
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.060]   most places as compared to most places in the world.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:20.160]   But what I feel very good about today that I didn't feel very good about five years ago
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.800]   was that now that's an option.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.320]   I'm not stuck in the United States like I was five years ago.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.920]   Today I could leave and I could sever my relationship with the country at any point in time.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.480]   It's not always free to do that.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:37.000]   There are exit taxes etc. that have to be planned for and considered.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.400]   But to me that has helped me to be much more relaxed and sanguine about this entire situation.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.020]   And I would encourage you, so if you'd like to know how to create a plan B, go to internationalescapeplan.com,
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.480]   take my course and I'll explain it to you very carefully.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.960]   It's something that everybody should do.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   Even if you say, "Joshua, for the rest of my life I'm going to live in the United States."
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   Great.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.480]   I'll probably be there with you in the future.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.160]   But still you should go and you should do the stuff that I explain in that course.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.120]   It makes all the sense in the world and it's really, really important.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.320]   And it will bring you a sense of freedom.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.440]   You won't care about politics nearly so much.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   You won't argue about this stuff nearly so much once you know that it's all optional.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.940]   Your participation in it is optional.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:24.960]   So making a long-term plan in terms of taxation could be important because if government raises
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.600]   taxes that could cost you quite a lot of money.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.900]   In terms of spending, again I don't think the government is going to lower spending
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.080]   much until it has to.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.640]   But remember that default is always an option.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   They could default.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.700]   And so if there are things that you yourself are particularly concerned about, you may
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.200]   wish to establish redundancy.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.880]   So if you think that Medicare and Medicaid are facing really bad situations, then it
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   might behoove you to go ahead and make a plan to have access to another government's welfare
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.960]   programs.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.480]   So I think it makes a lot of sense to be a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.580]   And that way if the welfare system in the United States is breaking down, you gain access
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.720]   to the welfare system in Canada.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.440]   If you're not getting the treatment that you want in the welfare system in Canada, then
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.160]   gain access to the United States.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.220]   At the moment, and then the other thing is in addition to government welfare programs
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.120]   or government health care programs, etc., health insurance programs that you may gain
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.920]   access to, you might want to consider the place of medical tourism.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:36.060]   And so in North America, we basically have this perfect trifecta at the moment where
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.320]   you can get incredible medical care at a much lower cost in Mexico.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.640]   So you can go to Mexico for medical tourism.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:47.440]   You can gain access to all the benefits of the United States.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.240]   And then if you also have access to Canada, you've got a great trifecta.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:56.120]   You've got two governments with strong welfare programs that if you satisfy the relevant
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.960]   requirements and laws, etc., that can provide you with the government benefits that are
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960]   useful.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.680]   And then you can gain access to Mexico, which does not have a strong government welfare
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.360]   program, but does have a great private market for you to simply pay for the care that you
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   need.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.240]   And so you may want to think about some form of diversification for that.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.440]   I've worked with many clients who, for example, have maintained Canadian residency for this
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.640]   purpose.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.180]   And I think it makes a lot of sense for you to consider what are those things that I would
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.240]   need and how do I provide for them.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.880]   And again, internationalization is not the only thing, but it can be an important thing.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   Maybe you live in a downtown area in the United States, but you go ahead and you buy a humble
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.160]   cottage in a rural area knowing that if I couldn't maintain my expensive lifestyle,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.880]   this would be my backup lifestyle.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:49.720]   I think many people overestimate the benefits of retiring to a so-called cheap country,
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:54.520]   but there is no question that many people have improved their lifestyle by making that
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   move.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.560]   So as long as you have community and your consumption needs are modest, having a plan
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.800]   for an international retirement to a lower cost of living place where you can get better
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.600]   health care, etc., I think is a smart move.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:15.960]   There is a bustling retirement, basically we call it retirement tourism, medical tourism
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.160]   market in many places.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.800]   Some in Central and South America, in Southeast Asia, there is a bustling market where you
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.920]   can go and for very modest amounts gain access to basically a continuing care retirement
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.080]   community, etc., that's beautiful and luxurious and where you have care that you need and
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:40.280]   good medical care, but the cost differences between those countries and the United States
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:46.080]   are so significant that you can really afford it in a strong and excellent way.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:53.480]   So these are the basic strategies to think through and then watch the situation over
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:23.440]   the coming years.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:34.120]   I'm not a skilled prognosticator or predictor of events, but it sure seems to me that at
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:43.640]   the moment in the US system, we don't engage in much excellent long-term strategic planning.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:50.760]   And so until we get to the point, and because the baby boomers hold so much political power
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:56.560]   and because the younger generation, which is increasingly a sizable voting bloc, tends
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.800]   towards big government left-wing thinking, I don't expect these programs to be cut in
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:09.560]   advance of, I don't expect them to be cut proactively.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.000]   It's just so obvious, right?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.040]   President Trump, or former President Trump, forgive me, I don't like to refer to former
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.560]   politicians.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   Presidency is not a kingship, so forgive the slip.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.000]   You're not a president for life.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.120]   Former President Trump, who's been, I guess, campaigning recently to be re-elected, represents,
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.400]   I think, the perfect kind of populist argument to say, "No, we're not even going to talk
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.240]   about cutting Social Security, Medicare, etc."
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.860]   I don't expect, I haven't heard of any kind of right-wing Republican who's even been willing
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.000]   to propose anything like this.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.360]   And then on the Democratic side, the idea of cutting these kinds of programs is just
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.680]   a non-starter.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.000]   So maybe at some point in time, there could be some cuts in defense spending, things like
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   that.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Who knows?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.920]   But at the end of the day, Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security are the huge issues, and
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.480]   since there's no political will to trim these, I don't think there'll be any meaningful political
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.800]   action until we get into a crisis point.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.480]   And at that point in time, who knows?
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.620]   Who knows what happens?
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.620]   Could tax rates change?
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:29.080]   Of course they could, but again, I think that if they changed, they would be fairly short-term
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.760]   in change.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.160]   When you look at some of the examples that we have around the world, whether it's the
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.200]   Connecticut millionaires tax or the Massachusetts millionaires tax or what the French tried
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.760]   when they said, "We're going to raise all these taxes," the big money has global options
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.200]   in a way that never before existed.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.400]   And while the United States is a great place to make a lot of money, it is not the only
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.860]   place that offers a great lifestyle.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:00.640]   And so big money has tons of global options today that never before existed.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:06.480]   And in an increasingly connected world, it's incredibly possible.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.760]   And there's so many great lifestyles that you can live tax-efficiently, that I think
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.840]   that if they doubled tax rates or doubled tax collection in some way, I think that would
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.560]   be a major flaw.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.160]   And of course, it would have massive economic harm, etc.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:29.080]   So I think the most likely solution is various forms of default and inflation.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:38.280]   That to me seems like the most probable scenario, because you can justify various forms of default,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   trimming back programs, etc.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.920]   And I think most people are willing to accept that.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   If you talk to most retiring millionaires, and you said, "We're going to impose means
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:45:00.640]   testing on Social Security," I don't hear strong rebuffs against that, at least in my
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.360]   personal conversations.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.200]   Regardless of someone's political convictions, I say, "Yeah, you know, that makes sense.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.900]   These programs are to protect the poor and indigent.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.520]   So if I don't get mine, that's fine."
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.760]   That seems to be more common in terms of what I hear.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:19.120]   And then inflation, broad levels of mass inflation will also reduce the bill for the government
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.340]   over time.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.720]   But your guess is as good as mine.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   That's the situation.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.280]   Those are Brian's, Brian Riedel's current up-to-date numbers on it.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   I will link in the show notes the previous episode, if you want to go back and listen
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.360]   to what I did on this subject four years ago.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.640]   I don't think that this means that an economic crisis is upon us.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   I don't even think it would stimulate a broad-scale economic crisis.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:49.160]   I think that these are long, slow-moving targets, and I'm just focusing on building a life that
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:55.800]   is independent of these programs, and hopefully I'll be able to be in a strong enough situation
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.140]   to then help some of the poor people who wind up getting hurt the most.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:08.920]   To me, what is, I think, most harmful about these programs is we see, if there were a
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:16.260]   collapse, and I try to hesitate using that word, but what happens, why is that so destructive?
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:24.620]   These forms of welfare programs build an expectation into people's lives that relieves them of
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.620]   personal responsibility.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.460]   And I've known many people who lived exclusively on Social Security, and they said, "Why should
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.460]   I save money?"
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.460]   "Oh, because I've got Social Security."
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.460]   And so they start to count on Social Security being that thing that's going to provide them
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.200]   with their income.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:48.740]   And so what was a well-meaning program winds up creating more demand for its program.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.300]   And so there are people who just don't save money proactively.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.260]   Maybe there are indeed fewer poverty-stricken people living on the street in our communities
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.900]   because Social Security is there.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.420]   Maybe that's the case.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:04.060]   I think it's probably the opposite, though, meaning that, yes, they can live on Social
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.620]   Security, but there would have been more people who would have taken responsibility for themselves
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.860]   previously.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:18.060]   In addition, these government programs cut down on localized community levels of charity.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.300]   And people say, "Well, I'm not going to.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.500]   Why should I give?"
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.340]   If you go to the United States, where social welfare programs are abundant, and you see
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.740]   people begging on the side of the street, at least a lot of people I hang out with say,
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.340]   "Well, that guy is just there to make money.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.340]   He doesn't need it.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:33.580]   There's plenty of stuff available to him."
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.500]   Or you go to places with a strong welfare state where there's guaranteed—I guess the
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.380]   Swiss maybe, I'm not super informed—but places like Switzerland, where there's clear
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:48.140]   government programs, I don't think the Swiss give a lot of money on a personalized basis
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:55.300]   to local people because they know that if somebody genuinely doesn't have it, the welfare
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.020]   program is there, and it's strongly run by the government to alleviate those situations,
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.900]   and I pay taxes and that cares for it.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.060]   Now flip that on its side, and you can see in other places where those programs don't
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.860]   exist, then people are much more giving in terms of, "This is my charity giving.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.980]   I need to make a donation to this poor person because clearly he has no legs.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.740]   He can't work," or etc.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.660]   And so while I think it certainly feels more comfortable for most of us to not be in a
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:30.900]   situation where there are beggars, that lack of local community expertise and skill of
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:36.180]   taking care of poor people, etc., I think leads to a lot of hardship over time.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:43.620]   So at the end of the day, I don't worry myself much these days about having opinions at all
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:49.060]   on these broad scale levels because not my circus, not my monkeys.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.540]   I can't do anything about it.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:55.820]   But what I can do is try to take care of my family, myself, prepare as I've told you.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.900]   I can inform you about it, and then you can do it, and then that'll have a ripple effect
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:05.980]   through some other people, and at least our families can get through the hard times.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.020]   And if we can get through the hard times, then we may be able to reach out a helping
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.540]   hand to those who need it as well.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.100]   So I hope this information is useful to you, and I wish you well.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:14.860]   Be back with you soon.
