[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We come this evening to a consideration of the words that are to be found in the ninth
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, beginning at the sixth verse.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.080]   Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect, for they are not all Israel,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.200]   that are of Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children;
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.400]   but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.080]   Now here we start a new subsection of this ninth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   You remember that in our general analysis of it at the beginning of the session we indicated
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.240]   that the first five verses constituted a subsection on their own, and that here another section
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   starts which runs on to the end of verse 13.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.440]   And it's at this point, of course, that the apostle proceeds to take up the real argument
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.120]   in verses one to five.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.680]   He's been merely introducing the subject.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360]   So that now as we come to the sixth verse in which he really gets down to the argument
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.160]   that he's concerned about, we must remind ourselves of what in general that argument
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.000]   is and as to what it's about.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.680]   And this, of course, applies not only to this section and to this chapter, but also to chapters
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.800]   nine and ten as well.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.040]   Now the problem with which he's dealing is this.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.720]   He's dealing with an objection which he has no need to imagine because it was an objection
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.600]   that was actually being brought against him and his teaching, an argument which was being
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.960]   brought against the preaching of the gospel in general.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.000]   But it is an objection and an argument in particular against what the apostle has just
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.440]   been saying at the end of chapter eight, and particularly there from verse 28 to the end.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.240]   There, you remember, in that glorious passage, he had been dealing with the final perseverance
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.080]   and the eternal security of the Christian believer, and he bases it ultimately upon
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   this one great thing, the purpose of God.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.600]   Verse 28 reads, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   to them who are the cold, according to his purpose."
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.880]   And it all depends upon the purpose of God.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   And we followed him as he worked out the argument in detail.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.440]   His argument there was that nothing could make God forgo his purpose.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.160]   Nothing could ever frustrate the purpose of God.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   So he ended off in that tremendous climax, "I am persuaded that neither death, nor life,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.160]   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.600]   height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680]   of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.720]   The absolute security of the believer because of the purpose of God, which never varies
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   and which cannot in any way be opposed or frustrated.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.120]   But immediately, the objection, the difficulty arises.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   That's all right.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.240]   But what about the case of the Jews?
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.160]   Are they not an immediate example of the very failure of God's purpose?
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.320]   Because here are people who were set into this unique position by God and to whom, as
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.480]   he has been reminding us in verses four and five, these covenants were made, who had the
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.600]   adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.400]   and the promises, whose are the fathers and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.440]   who is over all God blessed forever.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   Now here are these people, with all that we read about them in the Old Testament, people
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.640]   of God and the covenants and the promises and so on.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   But at the moment, according to this Christian preaching, they're outside, they're cast
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   away, they're unbelievers.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.160]   Doesn't this therefore prove that God's purpose can either change or else something
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.400]   can frustrate it?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   The whole case of the Jews says this objection.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   Sure, it is in and of itself sufficient to show and to prove that the purpose of God
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.760]   is not secure and safe, as the apostle has been arguing at the end of chapter eight.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.120]   Now that is the case which he is dealing with here.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.000]   Here are the Jews, rejected outside the kingdom, according to this teaching and according to
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   this preaching.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.120]   How, therefore, can one still go on talking about the certainty, the absolute certainty
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.160]   of the purpose of God?
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   Now that is the point with which the apostle proceeds to deal.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.840]   It looks on the surface as if God had abandoned his own people and all the promises that he'd
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.480]   ever made to them.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:31.000]   Now the apostle, I say, had been introducing that whole matter in the first five verses.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.840]   And there we saw that he puts the case with great sympathy and with great sorrow.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.120]   And he's anxious to show that he knows all about the promises to the Jews and their privileged
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   position.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.360]   That's why he gave us verses four and five.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   Very well, what is the answer?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.160]   What is the explanation?
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.920]   Can he still maintain this doctrine of his that the purpose of God never changes and
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   that nothing can ever hinder it or frustrate it?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.520]   Can he still go on saying that in the light of the position of the Jews?
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well now, here he begins his answer to that very question.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.520]   Now it is very interesting to notice that actually in these verses the apostle doesn't
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.680]   describe in detail the actual position and casting away of the Jews.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.280]   He doesn't actually say that until you come to chapter eleven, which is a very, very striking
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.720]   and interesting thing, a thing from which we should all, I think, learn a very great
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.000]   lesson.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   We observe again the delicacy, the sensitive nature and character of the great apostle
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.200]   and his tenderness.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   He doesn't say here immediately out at once that the Jews have been cast away.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.480]   That I say he reserves until he's almost finishing his argument in the eleventh chapter.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.720]   And that, I think, is the lesson we must all learn that when we are handling a difficult
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   matter like this, that we should always do so in a manner which is calculated to win
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.960]   people and to persuade them.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.680]   We don't start by denunciation.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.960]   Our Lord, you remember in his ministry, was exactly the same.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.760]   He didn't start by denouncing the Pharisees, though he knew all about them.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.640]   That is reserved again towards the end.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.720]   You'll find the great denunciation of the Pharisees in chapter twenty-three of Matthew's
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.080]   Gospel, not in chapter one or three.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:38.440]   In other words, state the case with tenderness, with affection, with love and with a desire
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.760]   to win.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.400]   Very well.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.320]   Nevertheless the apostle makes it quite plain and clear.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.720]   His continual heaviness, continual sorrow and great heaviness really tell us everything.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.400]   And it's quite enough.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.360]   He doesn't need to bring out the ultimate truth about them.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.800]   He's in great heaviness, continual sorrow because of them and because of their condition.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.240]   But the point that he's concerned about is not even their case and condition, but how
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   can he justify his preaching about the purpose of God?
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.540]   As I indicated in the first evening on this ninth chapter, this is a theodicy.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.640]   This is a defense of God and a justification of his ways to men.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   How does he do it?
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.880]   Well, now, then, this sixth verse is the key verse to this particular section.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   Indeed, it's the key to the whole section, right away to the end of chapter eleven.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   It's the most important verse, this.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.840]   Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect, for they are not all Israel that are
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   of Israel.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.280]   There, if you like, is the text.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.000]   Then in verses seven to thirteen he explains and expounds and elaborates his text.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's his method.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.600]   We've seen it so often.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.800]   And it's the ideal method.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.160]   Put down your principle, make your big statement, then come along, demonstrate it, illustrate
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.480]   it, show it, prove it, establish it, and then gather it all up and wind it all up again
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.120]   at the end.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.640]   Now, the key verse, therefore, I say, is this sixth verse.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:28.240]   And verses seven to thirteen are an exposition of that, and especially of this last phrase
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.520]   in which he says that they are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   There he is, as I'm going to show you, giving us the true meaning of the term Israel.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   And his argument, for me to just state it tersely before we come into it in detail,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   is this.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.480]   His argument is that God's word has done, is doing, and will do what it is meant to
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   do.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.880]   So the question is, what is it meant to do?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:07.080]   And the answer is that it was only meant for the elect in Israel, and not for all who are
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   in Israel.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.280]   That's what he's setting out to prove.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   See that's the reply to the argument and the contention that are brought against him.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.480]   So he lays it down, he makes his blunt statement, the word of God has not failed in its purpose.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.320]   So the question is, what is its purpose?
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.040]   Very well then, let's follow him now as he works out his argument.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.920]   You notice the first thing he does is to make a statement.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.480]   And the statement is just a categorical assertion, not as though the word of God hath taken none
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   effect.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.000]   Now let's be clear about the translation of this.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.080]   Incidentally, let's observe that here he is more or less repeating what he's already
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.240]   done in chapter 3 and in verse 3.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:02.120]   You see, having proved in the first two chapters, and especially in chapter 2, that the Jews
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.000]   were in as bad a case as were the Gentiles, he then raises the question, what advantage
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.960]   then hath the Jew?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.760]   Or what profit is there of circumcision?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   Much every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.920]   Then, for what if some did not believe?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.560]   All their unbelief make the faith of God without effect.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.240]   That's more or less what he's going to do again.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.400]   But there he just threw it out, leaving it to be worked out in detail until he comes
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.580]   here to this ninth chapter.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.560]   But it's the same essential point.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.600]   And what he says is this, having described the condition of the Jew, the privileges in
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:53.280]   verses 4 and 5, and his terrible heaviness and constant sorrow because these people were
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   up there, it's all implied, are not believers and are indeed cast out.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.040]   He says, "Not of course, not of course that the word of God hath taken an effect."
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.640]   Or, you can translate it like this, "The case is not as though the word of God hath
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.080]   taken an effect."
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.400]   That's another translation.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.680]   Literally, more or less literally, it is this.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   But the thing, that's to say the state of the case, is not such as this.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.920]   That is perhaps the most literal translation of all.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.040]   Well now, he says, "Let's be clear about this.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.480]   The fact that they are there and that I am troubled about them does not mean that the
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.000]   word of God hath taken none effect."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.760]   Now what does he mean here by the word of God?
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.160]   Well it's important that we should be clear about this.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   Everywhere in the New Testament, I think you will find, with one exception apart from this,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.120]   the word of God stands for the gospel.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.440]   Now let me give you some illustrations of this.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.480]   Just to show you that generally speaking in the New Testament, the word of God means the
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   gospel.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.760]   We read, for instance, in 2 Corinthians 2 and in verse 17, "For we," he says, "are
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   not as many as corrupt the word of God.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.440]   But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ."
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:35.240]   You've got the same thing precisely in the fourth chapter of that second epistle to the
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.120]   Corinthians in the second verse.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.160]   "But we have renounced," he says, "the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:49.560]   nor handling the word of God," that's to say, the gospel, "deceitfully, but by manifestation
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.400]   of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.040]   You've got exactly the same use of it in 2 Timothy 2.9.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.280]   I don't trouble to read these passages.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:11.360]   2 Timothy 2.9, Titus 2.5, Hebrews 13.7, Revelations 1.9, 6.9, and everywhere in the book of the
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   Acts of the Apostles.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.960]   The only other exception, in addition to the one that we have before us this evening, is
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.280]   in the gospel according to St. Mark, chapter 7, and verse 13.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.760]   And there the context makes it quite plain.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:37.640]   He is again dealing with these Jews, and he says, "Making the word of God of none effect
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.880]   through your tradition which ye have delivered, and many such like things do ye."
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.680]   Now remember that the context is this.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.320]   "Albeit in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.380]   For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.200]   pots and cups and so on, and many other such like things ye do."
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.960]   And he says, "Full well ye reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.320]   Moses said, 'Honor thy father and mother, and whosoever curseth father or mother, let
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   him die the death.'
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.680]   But you say, 'If a man shall say to his father or mother, 'It is Corban,' that is to say
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.480]   a gift, 'by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, he shall be free.'
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.440]   And you suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother."
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.800]   Making the word of God, that is to say the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.120]   It means there the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.440]   Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered, and
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.480]   many such like things do ye.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.960]   Now there, it refers to the Old Testament, but here, again it doesn't mean gospel, the
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.080]   gospel.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   What does it mean then?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.560]   Well here, quite clearly, the word of God at this point means the purpose of God, the
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.520]   declared purpose of God.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   Whether it be promise or threat or decree or whatever it is, that is the word of God,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.480]   something God has stated, something God has proposed to do.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.840]   It includes the covenants, it includes the promises, and all these other things that
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.440]   we've been looking at together.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.560]   So when he says here, "Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect," he's not saying
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   that the gospel has had none effect, he doesn't mean that.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:33.280]   What he's arguing about here is this great purpose of God, which he started dealing with
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.320]   in the 28th verse of the 8th chapter.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.880]   Very well, that's the definition of what is meant by the word of God.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.640]   And he says, "Not that the word of God hath taken none effect."
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.280]   And this is the striking word that he uses here.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:58.160]   It means it hasn't fallen to the ground or been ineffective or ineffectual.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.280]   And what is again interesting is the tense which he uses, "Not as though the word of
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.560]   God hath taken none effect."
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:15.640]   He uses the perfect tense, which means this, "Not as though the word of God has failed
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.520]   in the past or is now failing."
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.240]   It includes the past and the present.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.800]   The particular tense that the apostle used quite deliberately is a tense that carries
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.040]   the double meaning in it.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.200]   "Not as though the word of God has failed in the past or is failing or falling to the
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   ground or being ineffectual in the present either."
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:44.760]   Now then, here then is his great fundamental statement and proposition.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.560]   But let's be clear about it.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   And here again is a very valuable point for us to observe as we in turn are put to it
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.680]   by modern detractors or those who come to us asking questions to defend the truth of
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   God.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:08.040]   Now, he's not saying that the word of God cannot fail.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.440]   What he's saying is that it hasn't failed.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   Why do I take the trouble to point out that?
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.080]   Well, for this reason.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.520]   That so many of us, if somebody tackled us along these lines and said, "Now look here,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.600]   you say that this purpose of God is absolutely sure.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.440]   You quote Toplady and say that nothing can make him, his purpose, forgo or sever my soul
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   from his love.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.880]   How do you prove that?"
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.400]   Well, our tendency would be to fall back at once upon the sovereignty of God and say,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.040]   "Because God is God, it cannot fail."
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.800]   Now, that isn't what the apostle is actually saying.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.040]   He believes that, of course, but he's not saying that here.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.000]   He is going to prove it in another way, and he's going to prove it in a very much stronger
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.320]   way, especially in view of the fact that he's dealing with and arguing with Jews.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:02.640]   Now, the lesson, therefore, that I would suggest is this one.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.560]   Always try to answer the people who are putting the question.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.080]   I mean by that that if you're dealing with a Jew, as the apostle is dealing with the
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.560]   Jews and their objection primarily here, well, try to give it in a form or to use an argument
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.480]   which will be particularly effective with Jews.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.640]   Now, this is his method, as you know.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   He preached like that.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   He did everything like that.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.200]   "And to the Jew I become as a Jew, to the Gentile as a Gentile, to the one who is under
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.240]   the law I speak as a man under the law, to the one who is outside the law as outside
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.240]   the law.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.640]   I have made all things to all men that I might by all means save some."
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   So he doesn't just fall back on the general argument of the sovereignty of God.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.760]   He meets them on their own grounds and takes the ground from beneath their feet.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   He believes in the absolute sovereignty of God, and that is a final answer.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.040]   But in addition to that, I say, he works it out in this way.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.400]   The state and the condition of the Jews, he's going to show them, does not imply any change
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:12.720]   whatsoever, still less any failure with respect to God's eternal purpose.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   Now then, how is he going to do it?
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.240]   Well immediately he puts it all in a nutshell.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.720]   Here it is.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:30.560]   "Not as though the word of God hath taken an effect, for they are not all Israel, which
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   are of Israel."
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:37.480]   Now then, there is the fundamental proposition.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.800]   Now a better way of translating that perhaps could be something like this.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:55.000]   Not all those who are out of Israel as a source, these are Israel, the true Israel.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.160]   That's more or less a literal translation.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.920]   Not all those who are out of Israel, these are Israel.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.280]   So that our authorized translation here is quite a good one.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.840]   They are not all Israel, who are of Israel.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.580]   It does really convey the meaning.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.280]   Now then I say, here is a very crucial and fundamental statement.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.760]   Once more, let me show you.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.400]   Now the apostle has already said it.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.600]   He said it a long time ago, but he comes back to it.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.800]   When did he say it before?
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:35.560]   He said it before at the end of chapter 2, in verses 28 and 29, where you read, "For
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.920]   he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:48.960]   flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.560]   the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God."
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   That's it.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.840]   Same point, same point exactly.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.880]   But there of course, let's try to learn from this man how to conduct an argument.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.520]   There you see, there was no need to say more at that moment.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.880]   He was now there just dealing with this one great point of justification.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.200]   So he asserts it as the truth, but he doesn't elaborate it.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.120]   It's here he's going to elaborate it, where he takes this whole question of the Jew and
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.080]   really goes into it thoroughly.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:29.320]   In the same way, he's hinted at it in chapter 4 also, where he's dealing with this whole
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.920]   question of the case of Abraham that he took up from the standpoint of justification.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.080]   So that he says in verse 11, "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:45.560]   of the faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all them that
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.240]   believe, though they be not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed unto them also,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.040]   and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:03.240]   also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.280]   For the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.920]   through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.600]   All right, it's essentially the same point, but he takes it up here and now he's really
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.840]   going to give it a very thorough and exhaustive treatment.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.680]   Now why do I say that this is such a vital and all-important statement?
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.400]   I don't hesitate to assert that in many ways this is, from the standpoint of understanding,
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.520]   one of the most crucial statements in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Why do you say that, says somebody?
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.680]   Well, let me answer the question.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.360]   It is an absolutely essential statement if we want to understand properly the Old Testament
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   history.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:54.200]   Now, it's so easy to get lost in that Old Testament history and to fail to understand
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   exactly.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.960]   Here is God choosing one and not another, two brothers and so on, and the whole nation
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:08.200]   of Israel, and the point of all those genealogical tables that we have there, and one line being
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.800]   worked out and the others having been mentioned dropped, and you hear no more about them.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.680]   Now, all this can be very confusing.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.880]   Here is the key to the answer.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.840]   Here is the key to the answer of all that.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.960]   It is also the key to the answer of the checkered history of the children of Israel, of their
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.800]   constant disobedience, their constant complaining to God and grumbling to God.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Here is the explanation of why eventually they found themselves in the captivity of
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   Babylon.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:46.600]   You see, it was all due to the fact that they kept on assuming and thinking that because
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.320]   they were the children of Israel, nothing could go wrong with them, and that God must
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.520]   always bless them, so that when he didn't, they couldn't understand.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.160]   And they suggested that God was going back on his promises, that he wasn't fair, and
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   so on.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.800]   It was all due to the fact that they did not realize that they are not all Israel, but
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.480]   are of Israel.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:16.120]   So you see, it is a wonderful key to an understanding of the history unfolded in the Old Testament
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   pages.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:24.520]   But come along, it is also a vital principle in the understanding of the four Gospels in
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.800]   the New Testament.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   What is it that you find in the pages of the four Gospels?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   Well, have you ever noticed the amount of time and space that is given to the various
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:46.320]   arguments and wranglings in which our Lord had to be involved with the Jews, the Pharisees
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.400]   and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law?
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.800]   People have often complained about that.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.000]   Why can't we have the simple teaching, they say?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.480]   Why can't we have the direct message?
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.160]   Why have we got to have all this about the Jews and their questions and their oppositions?
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   What's it all about?
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   What does it all mean?
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   People don't understand it.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.680]   That's because they don't understand this principle.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:14.640]   The key to the understanding of all the attitude of the Jews, especially the religious leaders,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:21.400]   to our Lord himself, is to be found in this phrase, that they are not all Israel, but
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.320]   are of Israel.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.920]   The first man to make this point, of course, was John the Baptist.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.440]   He was the forerunner.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.480]   He was the first preacher.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.560]   And you remember how John the Baptist puts it.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.400]   Here he is, you see, out in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.960]   remission of sins.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   And the people came crowding out from all parts to listen to him.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.000]   And this is what we find John saying.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.560]   He faces a congregation of Pharisees and scribes and all sorts of people.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.920]   And he looks at them and he says in Luke 3, 8, "Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.400]   repentance.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:09.360]   And begin not to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:17.080]   For I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:22.240]   You see, John, with his spiritual insight, he knew their attitude, their mentality, and
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.360]   their whole outlook.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.400]   He knew that they were saying in their hearts, "Why do you call us to repentance?
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   We are the children of Abraham.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.960]   Go and preach something like that, if you like, to Gentiles, but not to us.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.400]   We be Abraham's."
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.160]   So he says, "Don't begin to say in yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:50.440]   I say to you that God is able to raise up of these stones children unto Abraham."
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.920]   What he's saying in effect is this.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.060]   I know that you're the children of Abraham.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.480]   I know that you're Israelites, but they're not all Israel that are all Israel.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.560]   And then, of course, we have that other illustration of it in that passage which we read at the
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.960]   beginning from the eighth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, where our Lord puts
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.640]   it very explicitly indeed.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.040]   And he has to because of what they say.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.760]   Here is our Lord preaching, and we are told that as he spake these words, many believed
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   on him.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:29.320]   "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, 'If you continue in my word, then
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:38.880]   are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.360]   But instead of thanking him and thanking God, this is what we read.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.320]   They answered him, 'We be Abraham, see, and were never in bondage to any man.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:56.120]   How sayest thou ye shall be made free?'"
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.720]   And then he answers them, you remember, and amidst the things he said to them is this
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:07.080]   in verse 37, "I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill me because my word
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.920]   hath no place in you."
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.400]   And then he goes on to say, "They answered and said unto him, 'Abraham is our father.'
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.720]   Jesus said unto them, 'If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.080]   But now you seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.480]   This did not Abraham.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.680]   I know that you are Abraham's seed.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.320]   Then at the same time, if you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.'"
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:45.000]   All that is just another way of saying, they are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.080]   So you see, it is essential to an understanding of all this disputation and misunderstanding
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:59.160]   that takes place right through the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.360]   In exactly the same way, it is the essential key to the understanding of the treatment
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.240]   that was meted out to the apostles as they went out preaching the Gospel, as it is recorded
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.840]   in the book of Acts of the apostles.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   The trouble they had when they went and preached in the synagogues, the way they eventually
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.280]   had to leave and go to the Gentiles, Peter and Paul and so on.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.360]   All this trouble, the story in the book of Acts again, is rarely understood as we grasp
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.920]   this fundamental principle that is laid down here.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   Now what was the trouble?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.760]   Well, the trouble was this.The Jews at the time of our Lord and the time of the apostles
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.320]   were making the same fatal assumption that they had made right through the Old Testament.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   What is it?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.660]   It is this.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.320]   They were assuming that the mere fact that they were Jews, that they were descendants
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:55.780]   of Abraham, they were assuming that that fact alone saved them in and of itself.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.160]   They needed no new salvation.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   They had no need to believe on Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God and one who was to die for
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   them.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   They were already saved.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.520]   Hence the fury of the Pharisees when he convinced them of sin and promised them that he would
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.440]   set them free.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.920]   That is the whole explanation.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.240]   They said, "We are Abraham's seed.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.200]   We are the children of Israel and you must not speak to us like that."
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.400]   It is still the trouble with Pharisees, whether they be Jews or Gentiles.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.840]   It is the cause of the offense of the cross.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.960]   It is why they always get annoyed.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.880]   It is what makes such people say, "This man preaches to us as if we were sinners."
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.960]   They do not think they are sinners for various reasons.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   Very well.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   So you see how important it is.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.680]   So I go on to this.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.760]   I say in the fourth place that this great principle laid down here by the apostle is
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.520]   absolutely essential to the whole doctrine of salvation.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   What do I mean?
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.880]   This is where it becomes very urgent and very practical for us.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.840]   That is why I am elaborating it as I am doing this evening.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.480]   Somebody may say, "What has all this got to do with me?
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.960]   They are not all Israel that are of Israel."
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.440]   All right, it may have been a wonderful argument with respect to the Jews at that time, but
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.720]   where is its relevance to me?
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.440]   Well, let me try to show you.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.680]   Here is the key to two questions.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:29.880]   How is the salvation that has been worked out by the Lord Jesus Christ applied to anybody?
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.440]   That is one question.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.600]   Secondly, to whom is that salvation applied?
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.200]   Now then, let me subdivide that second one.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.120]   To whom is the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ applied?
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.920]   Let me ask four questions.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.360]   Is there such a thing as a Christian country?
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.920]   Does the fact that you are born and brought up in a country that is called Christian mean
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.480]   that you are a Christian?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.680]   Whereas people born and brought up in what are called pagan countries are not Christians?
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   Do we believe that?
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   That is what this principle deals with.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.480]   There are many people who think that everybody born in this country is a Christian.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:22.640]   Secondly, are the children of Christian parents of necessity Christians?
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.480]   There are many who believe that, that the children of Christian parents are ipso facto
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:36.720]   of necessity Christians, because their parents were Christians, and that there are promises
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   to this effect.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.280]   Therefore, every child born to Christian parents is already a Christian.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.400]   Some would argue that that is why he should be baptized, because he is already a Christian.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   People have argued that.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.720]   There are people still arguing that.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:34:02.200]   Thirdly, are baptized children of necessity Christians because they have been baptized?
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.560]   The Jew argued that anyone who had been circumcised was therefore an Israelite and therefore a
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   Saint.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:16.640]   There are people who argue still that every child that is baptized is of necessity a Christian.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   That is raised here.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.760]   They are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.920]   These have all been circumcised, but they are not all Israel which are of Israel.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:34.640]   And so my last question, my fourth question, is this one.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:43.120]   Is anybody who is baptized, whether as a child or as an adult, is anyone, are all who are
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   baptized and all who are church members of necessity Christians?
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.760]   Those are the questions, and they are very important and they are very relevant questions.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:07.880]   I was reading an article by an evangelical writer a few weeks ago in which he referred
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.780]   to the many people in this country today who never darkened the doors of a place of worship,
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:21.200]   but who were baptized when they were infants as lapsed Christians.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.320]   He called them lapsed Christians.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   They have no interest in Christianity at all.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.120]   They never go near a place of worship.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   They say they don't believe in it.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:38.000]   But because they were baptized when they were infants, they are described as lapsed Christians.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.440]   You see, this is a very tremendous question, a most important, a most urgent question at
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.000]   this very time.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.080]   This is, I'm putting it in its modern form now, it's the same principle exactly as
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.240]   the apostle is laying down here.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.480]   Very well, how does he deal with it?
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.320]   Well, this is how he deals with it.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:04.440]   He says the important thing to concentrate on is the meaning of the term Israel.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.640]   And so he says the following things.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:17.480]   One, the term Israel has two connotations, a general one and a particular one.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   Of Israel, Israel, external, internal, physical, spiritual.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   That's his first point.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.040]   This term Israel, he says, now there is a whole confusion, he says, has arisen.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:38.440]   People say that God's purpose has gone astray or that it's fallen to the ground simply because
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.440]   they have not understood the meaning of the term Israel.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.000]   They say God's promises are to Israel.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   There, he says, is the bulk of the nation outside, therefore the promises have fallen.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   He says it's just a failure to realize that this term Israel has these two meanings or
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.720]   connotations, general, particular.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.520]   Of Israel, Israel.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.600]   External Israel, internal Israel.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.280]   Physical Israel, spiritual Israel.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:12.200]   So that secondly, he suggests that there are then two Israels.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.880]   One is the nation as a whole.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:27.120]   The other is those who are the true spiritual descendants of Jacob, the first Israel, and
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.480]   true heirs of the promises.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   May to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as we've already seen.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:44.640]   So that's his second deduction, that there are then these two kinds of Israel.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:54.480]   Thirdly, all belong to the former, to the general, to the external, to the physical,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.520]   but only some belong to the second.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.720]   All the children of Israel belong to the nation.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.440]   They all belong to the physical nation.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.560]   They all are in physical descent from Abraham.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.320]   Everybody is included there.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.760]   But they're not all included in this second meaning, this special meaning, this internal
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.280]   meaning, this spiritual meaning.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.880]   Now this is the most important point.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   All are in the one, but only some are in the second.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.360]   The ones in the second are in the first, but there are many in the first who are not in
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   the second.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.320]   Very well, there's the third deduction.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:49.640]   Number four, God's purpose and promises have reference only to the second group, this Israel
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.680]   as he calls it.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.520]   All who are of Israel are not Israel.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.600]   All who are of Israel, who belong to the nation, are not in this real Israel.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:10.280]   Now then, he says, God's promise, God's promises and purpose have reference only to the latter,
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:17.080]   this inner Israel, this special Israel, this spiritual Israel, not the Israel according
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   to the flesh.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:24.040]   That is the real scope of the promise and the purpose of God.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   So that he arrives at his fifth and final deduction, which is this.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:38.320]   The promises of God have never failed with regard to the true Israel, and they never
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.520]   will.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.640]   Not as though the word of God had taken any effect, for they are not all Israel that are
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   of Israel.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:54.880]   The promises of God have never fallen and never will with regard to Israel, truly understood.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   They were never meant to apply to the generality who are merely of Israel.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:09.240]   They were meant for this peculiar group only, and in their case, they have not failed, they
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.640]   are not failing, and they never will fail.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.720]   So that as I close this evening, let me apply this to the four questions that I've already
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.360]   put to you.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.040]   Is there such a thing as a Christian country?
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   The answer is no.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.260]   Secondly, are children of Christian parents of necessity Christian?
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.680]   The answer is no.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.740]   Are baptized children of necessity Christian?
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.800]   The answer is no.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.720]   Are all who are baptized, whether children or adults, and all who are church members
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.440]   of necessity Christian?
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.120]   The answer is no.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.080]   Why?
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:41:01.160]   For this reason, that there is this essential and vital distinction which the Protestant
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:09.280]   Reformers rediscovered in the Scriptures and reemphasized as over against the Roman Catholic
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:20.920]   Church and her teaching, the distinction between the visible and the invisible church.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   All belong to the visible church, but all do not belong to the invisible church.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.040]   A man who belongs to the invisible church of necessity belongs to the visible church
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:38.200]   also, but you can belong to the visible church without belonging to the invisible church.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.120]   That's the distinction.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:45.960]   All are not Israel, but are of Israel.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:53.400]   All are not really in the church of God and of Christ, who belong to the visible church
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.040]   of God and of Christ.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:07.120]   All are not truly members of the body of Christ, who belong to the visible, external, organized
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.440]   church.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.880]   Very well then, we must leave it at that for this evening.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:20.360]   But you see the vital importance and relevance of this principle, not only with regard to
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.520]   the case of the Jews at that particular time, nearly two thousand years ago, not merely
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.200]   and not only in its precise relevance with regard to the argument about the purpose of
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   God.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.840]   Can't you see that our whole position as Christians depends in many senses upon this?
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:44.360]   There are many who come to the place of worship regularly every Sunday, here and elsewhere,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.000]   and hear the gospel, but have never believed it.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.760]   And it's generally because they've never seen that they need it, and they resent it.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.960]   It's because they haven't realized this truth.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:07.080]   There are many relying upon birth, upon baptism, at any age.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.880]   There are many relying on parentage.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.480]   There are many relying upon church membership.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.720]   Here once and forever the principle is laid down that ought to disabuse our minds of all
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.900]   such error.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   They are not all Israel.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.600]   They are not all of Israel.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:37.060]   Thank God the apostle goes on to show us the difference between the two, and what it really
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:46.440]   means to belong to the true Israel of God, to whom the promises belong, and in whose
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:54.400]   case the purpose is operating, and in whose case alone the purpose was ever designed and
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.840]   meant to operate.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.480]   The word of God has not fallen to the ground.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.560]   Let's be clear as to what it was meant to be.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.600]   At the moment we are clear about that, we shall see that it has done it, is doing it,
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.840]   and always will do it, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   Let us pray.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:25.320]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee and bless thy great and holy name for these things.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.680]   We marvel, O God, at it all, at the wisdom, the greatness, and the glory of it all.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.080]   We rejoice in it humbly before thee.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:43.680]   We thank thee, O God, that our safety and security depend upon thy purpose.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:50.480]   Thy strong grasp of us are not our frail hold of thee.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.680]   Lord, make us more and more wise, we humbly pray thee, unto these things, that we may
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   ever give thee all the praise and all the honor and all the glory, who alone art worthy
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.520]   to receive it.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:12.040]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.720]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:23.960]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   and evermore.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   Amen.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   Amen.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:32.040]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
