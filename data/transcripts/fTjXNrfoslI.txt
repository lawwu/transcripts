[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.140]   Pastor John, what would you say to a pastor who uses his church on Sundays as a studio?
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.640]   Essentially, he preaches past his people into a video camera, into a microphone,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.120]   with the main goal of producing online content.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.920]   In other words, his church is just a mechanism, just a studio for him to address an online audience through them.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.600]   Well, I would try to encourage him first that it's not wrong to have a wider ministry,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:43.200]   but it is wrong to pretend that you have a flock that you shepherd when you don't have a flock that you shepherd.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.080]   You have a studio, or you have a stepping stone, or you have an excuse.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:59.880]   And if that's true, you shouldn't presume to say you have a flock because God has some really, really serious things to say about that kind of shepherd in Ezekiel 34.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.680]   He says, "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.080]   Prophesy and say to them, even to the shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.200]   'Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves, should not shepherds feed the sheep?
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.240]   You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with wool, you slaughter the fat ones, and you do not feed the sheep.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.760]   The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled over them.'"
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   Those have always been unbelievably serious words to me as a pastor.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   And I think Peter picks it up in 1 Peter when he says, "So I exhort you as a fellow elder,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:03.160]   shepherd the flock of God that is in your charge, exercise oversight, don't rule with compulsion, do it willingly, set a good example for your people."
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:13.080]   So it seems to me there is a profound inauthenticity about preaching past your people in front of you, past your flock.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.640]   And that inauthenticity, I think, may get a crowd in the short run, but will not be blessed by God in the wider church in the long run.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   Instead, I think the mindset should be—this is what I'd say to anybody who's being tempted this way—
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:40.120]   serve your people with your best energy, serve your people with full affection, serve your people with focused attention, feed your flock with the food they need.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.840]   Don't give them generic messages for a generic audience.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   Let the extent of the ripple effect of serving your people be the impulse of others, not yourself.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:05.480]   In other words, if God means for you to have a wider impact because of what you're saying to your sheep, let others draw that out.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.080]   You just be so faithful. Love your people. Serve your people. Feed your people.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.680]   Beware of the addicting dangers of being widely known.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:26.120]   Don't pursue that. Pursue truth. Pursue edification and worship. Pursue your flock and let the ripples take care of themselves.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:38.200]   If other people want to draw that out, maybe one illustrates, you know, Spurgeon, his sermons were published in goodness, I don't know how many dozens of newspapers around the world.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.840]   Well, my best reading of Spurgeon is he didn't even know about some of those, and it wasn't his business to try to make that happen.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.800]   He wasn't getting up on Sunday saying, "Okay, I got to preach in a way that more newspapers will pick this up."
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   That's just not the way he thought. He fed his flock in front of him, and because that was so authentic and so helpful to that flock, others picked it up.
