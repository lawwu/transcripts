[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   Today is Saturday, August 22nd, and this morning around the country, Christians gathered together in cities to protest the activities of Planned Parenthood
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   and to protest government funding for the organization.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.900]   Early reports say that pro-life groups gathered at 320 different clinics around the country.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.700]   This marks one of the largest coordinated protests against Planned Parenthood,
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.800]   and this includes the Planned Parenthood in St. Paul, Minnesota, where John Piper participated.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.300]   Pastor John was asked to pray for the gathering, which he did, and what follows is a field recording of his prayer.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.300]   [Applause]
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:53.800]   Father in heaven, it's a sober moment to be this near to this place, and I pray that there would be in my heart and all of our hearts a kind of earnestness about what we're doing here.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   We want to just pause and stand in awe of you for a moment because you made us.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.800]   You made all the children. You made all the abortionists. You are our creator.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   You uphold all things by the word of your power.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   You sustain all things. You govern all things.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   You say, "I am God and there is no other."
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   I am God and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   saying, "My counsel will stand and I will accomplish all my purpose."
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   You are God and we are not.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   We humble ourselves under your mighty hand and we stand in praise and awe of your justice and wisdom and goodness and truth and power and eternal mercies towards your creation.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   And we acknowledge in the face of your holiness and power that we are sinners.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Everyone standing here in this gathering is a sinner in desperate need of salvation that you offer in Jesus Christ.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   We know that our consciences condemn us, and if our own consciences do, how much more your holy law.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   So we have not lived up even to our own standards, let alone to your standards.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   We confess our sins corporately before you as individuals, as churches.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   We have not given heed to your word as we ought, as a nation.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   We have not listened to the word righteousness exalts a nation and a sin brings reproach to any people.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   And we are a sinful people.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   We have gloried in our shame and inverted your law and made good what you call evil.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   We confess corporately that we are not what we ought to be and therefore we fly to Jesus Christ.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   We love your son.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   What would we do, we sinners here on this street, what would we do if there were no redemption in Jesus?
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   We would thank you for putting him forward to bear your holy wrath and take our punishment and put our sins on his back.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   That we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   And that's why we're here, Lord.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   We want to dedicate ourselves afresh and we want to pray for Planned Parenthood.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   That they might live to righteousness.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   We want to ask, Lord, that according to their title, which is on the wall, Planned Parenthood,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   that they would bring about nurturing parents, rather than helping parents stop being parents by killing their children.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   We ask that you would help them create and bring about nurturing parents by not taking the lives of future parents in the womb.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   We ask that you would grant that they would see, along with our nation, that killing children is not an acceptable solution to a crisis pregnancy.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   There are other ways forward. You are God.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   You make ways for people out of difficulties and killing is not one of them.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   So God, grant, I pray, that because of this event and all these videos and other things that you're going to be doing in our days,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   that truth would hold sway.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   We're not eager to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   We just want to see truth hold sway.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   So bring out of this building here all the truth that goes on in there.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   Let it be seen for what it is.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   And so, Lord, when you do these mighty works, may your name be honored and may Christ be exalted.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   May the gospel advance in our land.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   Amen.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   That was John Piper praying on site at a Planned Parenthood protest this morning in St. Paul, Minnesota.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   For more information, see John Piper's recent article, "Planned Parenthood, Invitation, Explanation, Indignation."

[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to this special weekend episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
