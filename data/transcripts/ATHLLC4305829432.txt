[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.840]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel,
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.740]   all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.100]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and today I want to talk about
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.860]   one of my favorite hacks of all time, credit card points.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240]   Thanks to this hack, I've been taking at least one free vacation
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.940]   every year for the last 10, 15, maybe even 20 years.
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.800]   And these aren't small trips, like, we're talking two-week trips
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.260]   around the world, luxury hotels, flying first class,
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.960]   loving every minute of it, all for free.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.260]   And if I added up the cost of all these trips,
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.140]   I probably saved hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.800]   In fact, I'm such a credit card optimizer
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360]   that I thought about doing this whole episode just by myself.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.900]   And then I met Alex.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.760]   Not only is Alex just as obsessed with credit cards and travel as I am
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760]   and helping make sure everyone he knows takes amazing trips
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   and earns as much as they can,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.740]   but he turned that passion into a site called Upgraded Points that he runs,
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.360]   where you can learn about the best cards, the best tricks to earn the most points,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.100]   travel hacks, reviews of hotels, and more.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.460]   So I thought it'd be even more fun and valuable to everyone listening
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.340]   if we do this show together.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.760]   And not to mention his accent makes everything we do sound better.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.100]   So let's get into it.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.960]   But first, a message from a guy I hired online to read this disclosure.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.940]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.500]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.040]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.260]   This podcast is for informational purposes only
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.240]   and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.960]   Alex, thanks for being here.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   Thanks so much, Chris, for inviting me. I'm super excited to chat with you.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.900]   Yeah, so credit card points are near and dear to my heart.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.060]   I'm really excited for this episode.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.440]   And I thought it'd be good to go back to early stuff.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040]   So for me, it turns out this started before I even remember it.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.800]   The picture I have of childhood, everyone has that photo
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.340]   that their parents are like, "This is my child."
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.600]   Mine was a picture of me sipping a bottle of apple juice
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.700]   with a pair of headphones on in a British Airways first-class seat
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.360]   on the way to London when I was 11 months old.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.240]   And that's been my ethos before I even knew it was my ethos.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.940]   And it turns out my parents schlepped me around the world
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300]   on various trips they took with points.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.760]   And so this started early for me before I even got into it.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.240]   Ultimately, in college, I was like, "I can get credit cards and earn points."
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.560]   I took my first trip and it all spiraled from there.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460]   But I'd love to know, how did you get into this game?
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.740]   Yeah, so I have a very clear memory of this.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.940]   10 years ago or so, end of 2011, I moved completely over to America from the UK.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.600]   And so obviously, I had to get on a flight to do that.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.640]   And I was traveling from London into Chicago.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.200]   And my life was like three big suitcases and that was it.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   And I booked this economy ticket.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.600]   I knew nothing about points.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.500]   Like the UK, there's three frequent flyer miles
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.300]   that are being split between the entire country.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.940]   There's no bonus points.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.440]   There's very little incentive for people to get excited about it.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.140]   So I knew nothing, got to the airport, I was booked for economy.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.800]   And basically, I turned up looking scruffy.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.340]   I used to always wear like a Superman t-shirt.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.240]   I like it, it wasn't great looking back.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.740]   But I rocked up to check in my bags.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.400]   And the lady who was serving me took my details.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.600]   And then she looked at me, she wasn't very impressed.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.740]   And once she had put all my details into the machine,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.400]   like she basically looked at me and said,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.900]   "Okay, it seems that you've been upgraded to business class."
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960]   And she said it with a snarl.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   She wasn't happy about it.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.960]   And I was thinking, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.860]   - How did that happen?
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.800]   - So no one ever told me in the end.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   Luckily what I had done,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.040]   and this is the only logical explanation for it.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.660]   I had signed up to the British Airways Executive Account membership
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.300]   and attached my number to the ticket.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.440]   That was the only thing I did.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.700]   I had no status, I had nothing.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.900]   And they upgraded me and she was so annoyed about it.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.500]   And then she was like, "Oh, but wait,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.100]   I see you've got some big bags there.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.660]   It's going to cost you 40 pounds to check."
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.400]   I was like, "Just take my wallet immediately.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.740]   This is not an issue."
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.240]   And inside I was rejoicing, got onto that flight
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.900]   and I got a taste of business class.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.700]   And so that was a double upgrade, by the way,
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.000]   like skip premium economy.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.100]   They were like, "Boom, you're in business."
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.600]   And the flight was super busy.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.900]   So I think what happened was that
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.400]   because I happened to have a loyalty count,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.040]   even though there was no status,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.360]   they decided to upgrade me.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.000]   So there's probably a lot of people on that flight
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.260]   who just didn't have a loyalty program
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.340]   attached to their booking.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.640]   So there's a lesson there.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.960]   Which we can talk about later.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.200]   But anyway, that's how I sort of got a taste
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   of business class.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.860]   I was like, "Oh my God,
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.760]   I don't want to do like economy again."
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.740]   So really when I got into America,
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.400]   starting up businesses and like points
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.160]   was just promoted on billboards, like everywhere.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.040]   Everyone's talking about them.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   Credit cards are absolutely everywhere
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   with these bonus promotions and things like that.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.040]   And I was so intrigued.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.800]   So I was spending money in my business,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.240]   obviously spending money to live and everything.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.760]   And I was like, "I'm an optimizer."
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.960]   So I was like, "I've got to dive into this world."
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.800]   So I followed a couple of blogs,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.860]   realized that this was actually something I could be doing.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.840]   And then I was completely addicted.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.900]   So basically for the last 10 years,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.460]   I've been researching it pretty much every day.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.000]   And then obviously now I run this site
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.060]   that I've had for like five years, that launched in 2016.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.760]   I'm fully immersed in it.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.800]   And a couple of years after coming to America,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.160]   like I took the first amazing sort of like redemption,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.540]   like first class and business class
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.840]   and all this sort of stuff.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.540]   And yeah, that's what like fed the addiction
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.600]   was that like free upgrade,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.500]   combined with the fact that like in America,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340]   like people just talk about this stuff like all the time.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.460]   It's so, I don't know if you spend a lot of time
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.300]   in the UK and everything,
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.960]   but people just don't talk about that stuff.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.200]   Like it's not promoted.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.000]   - It sounds like there aren't a lot of options
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.440]   to earn points there, like there are here.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.360]   - Exactly.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.900]   The competition is nowhere near as fierce as over here.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.940]   So yeah, it's-
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.340]   - Yeah, here, when you accept a credit card,
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.000]   you're paying like 3% almost fees to the processor.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.560]   And that money makes its way back
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.800]   to the credit card company in some format.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.960]   And then they say, we wanna get more people spending money.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.160]   So we'll give people points and it's this cycle.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.560]   And I always tell people,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.060]   if you're not paying with your credit card,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.800]   you're leaving money on the table.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.160]   And I think of it as a way to just get more money
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.700]   from banks, airlines.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.300]   These are hated industries.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.140]   - No, totally.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.460]   And yeah, it pains me as well.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.760]   When I see someone using a debit card, I'm just like,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.200]   okay, give them the benefit of the doubt.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.260]   Maybe they feel like they wouldn't be able
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.160]   to pay off their credit card if they had one
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.960]   and the temptation is too much.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.000]   But I think I'm too kind.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.200]   I think there's too many people there
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.740]   who just have not delved into that world a little bit
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.460]   and realized that debit cards,
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.160]   they offer such little value and the credit cards really,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.900]   I mean, the rewards and the bonuses and the perks
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.060]   that you can leverage from them are absolutely incredible.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.400]   And the only thing you have to do is make sure
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.260]   that you pay off your statement every single month.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.120]   If you do that, then all of those benefits are so worth it.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.320]   - Yeah, all the benefits of everything we'll discuss today
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.520]   never come close to being better than paying off your debt.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.060]   So if you have credit card debt,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.800]   focus on getting that down to the point
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.360]   that you can pay off your bill each month
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.520]   before you get into the credit card game.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.800]   Okay, so using a debit card is an obvious red flag
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.600]   that you're not optimizing your cards and points.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.700]   What else?
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.100]   - Actually, another red flag is when someone is using,
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.540]   I don't know, like an American Airlines card
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.240]   at a supermarket or when they're going out
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.700]   and having something to eat
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.140]   or buying some drinks or something,
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.900]   because a lot of the airline cards
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.860]   reward you really poorly for those transactions.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.840]   Whereas the flexible points,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.160]   like you can get three, four, five points per dollar spent
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   at supermarkets or filling up gas or dining out and stuff.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.580]   So you've got to look at where you're spending your money,
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.800]   the majority of it.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.900]   I take things to extremes.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.540]   I've got like 19 credit cards.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.840]   I've gone a bit mental with it.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   - More than me.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.800]   - I actually consolidated.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.900]   I was like, okay, once you go over 20,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.580]   like that is legitimately mental.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.440]   So I got rid of four recently,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.880]   but I staggered over to not hurt my credit too much.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.500]   But yeah, you wanna look at where you're spending your money.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.600]   So if you like going out and you like dining
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.540]   and you spend money at bars or whatever,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.900]   then you should really get a card
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.660]   that gives you like what we call like a multiplier bonus
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.600]   for those transactions.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.200]   - So how would someone even figure out
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.260]   where they're spending money
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.360]   to figure out what kind of credit cards might make sense?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.940]   Is there something you do to evaluate your spending?
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.000]   - You can use like a simple sort of like budget tracker,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.340]   like mint.com where you can connect all your cards
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.160]   to that account.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.800]   And then it automatically figures out
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.760]   where you're spending your money.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.100]   So you can just have a quick glance at that
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.740]   at the end of month and be like, huh, wow,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.340]   I actually spend like 35% of my money at restaurants.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.460]   So I should probably make sure that I'm getting a card
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.540]   that gives me, the general rule of thumb is
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.740]   I'm pretty annoyed.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.860]   I'm very annoyed if I'm only getting one point
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.060]   per dollar spent.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.000]   For me, it's gotta be like a minimum of one and a half
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.040]   or two.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.900]   And so yeah, mint basically is like a good option for that.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.100]   What do you use?
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.700]   - So I used to use Mint
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.160]   and there's a bunch of cool budgeting apps out there
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.040]   that are like Mint.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.840]   I just was playing around last night
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.200]   in advance of this conversation.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.700]   And I saw that both Chase and Amex have a spending report
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.940]   and they used to do these as like a PDF
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.000]   at the end of the year, only for the last year.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.200]   And now both of them have a look at the last few months,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   look at last year, and they'll just break it down
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.140]   by category.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.500]   So it's a little more work.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.700]   And that if you have two credit cards
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.040]   or one of them is at a bank that doesn't offer this,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.300]   you might have to look across all of them
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.540]   in multiple places.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.040]   And in that case, it might be way easier
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.860]   to just sync everything to Mint
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.760]   and then go look through all those transactions
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   and see where they are.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.160]   But I will say Mint sometimes gets the category wrong.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.900]   And I think the credit card companies
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.140]   get the category right a lot more.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.400]   So if your credit card company today
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.360]   offers one of these spending reports,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   I feel like it's the most accurate data.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.860]   But if you have credit cards at lots of places
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.760]   or they don't, Mint I think is still a great place
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.260]   to link an account and look at all the different
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.100]   budgeting things.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.260]   But don't look at Mint's credit card recommendations
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.940]   because not only are they incentivized
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.740]   by whoever's paying them the most,
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   but I swear every time I've logged into Mint,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.500]   they say, "You need an Amex Platinum."
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.000]   And I'm like, I have my and my wife's Amex Platinum
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.840]   linked to Mint.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.800]   Like, I don't need a third Amex.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.860]   I can't even get a third Amex Platinum.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.700]   So ignore the recommendation.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.660]   - Me and my wife both have a Platinum,
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.000]   like two Platinums each.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.860]   Like, I don't think we need any more.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.540]   - Yeah.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.460]   And you did mention credit earlier.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.640]   Let's talk a little bit about credit.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.380]   - Yeah, so when I came here from the UK,
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.920]   I had no credit at all.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.460]   The bank that I still have in the UK,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.420]   they were like, "Sorry, we can't transfer your credit
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.260]   "to the US."
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.060]   So you're basically like a 17-year-old in a hoodie
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.500]   with some shades on, walking around, like looking shifty.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.540]   - Well, it sounds like you actually were dressed like that,
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.180]   even though you might not have been 17.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.420]   - Yeah, just slight modification.
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   I had a Superman t-shirt on and that was it.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.260]   - Okay.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.460]   - Yeah, I was actually very lucky,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.900]   but this could be an option for many people.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.900]   My wife is American and her parents very generously,
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.440]   I needed a car when I got to America.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.280]   I was like, "Oh my God."
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   And I need a truck as well.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.560]   Like something that I don't, that's way too big,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.600]   but it's really cool.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.440]   And so I was like, "Okay, need a truck.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.040]   "Haven't got any credit.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.280]   "What do I do?"
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.720]   And her parents co-signed for me, which is amazing,
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.800]   because it was their credit, basically,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.280]   that I piggybacked off.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.240]   And so what I did was I purposely paid it off
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   over like 12 to 15 months to show the banks
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.080]   that I could pay on time and that I could do this regularly.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.420]   It wasn't just for one month, but it was 15 months.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.540]   And my credit rating like literally just skyrocketed
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.440]   into the 700s.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.700]   It was so fast.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.100]   - Something that people always ask me like,
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.540]   "Oh, isn't opening a bunch of credit cards
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.940]   "gonna hurt your credit?"
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.980]   It turns out that almost 65, 70% of your credit
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.200]   is your payment history.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.940]   So one, make your payments on time.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.540]   And if you didn't make a payment on time in the past,
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.060]   you can even go back and dispute it
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.740]   and maybe get that overturned.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.220]   And then it's actually your kind of debt to credit ratio.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.980]   So when you have a new card,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.060]   banks don't like lending money to people
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.100]   that are using all of their credit.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.980]   So if you have three cards,
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.540]   you actually have a whole lot more credit.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.500]   As long as you don't increase your spending three X,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.140]   it can actually help your credit.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.780]   Now, I know part of that credit score
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.180]   is inquiries against credit.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.020]   So when you open a card,
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.500]   you will lose five or so points each time,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.660]   but having more credit, paying on time,
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.820]   having a long history really adds to it.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.760]   So it can hurt your credit a little bit,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.380]   but the long-term benefit,
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.820]   and especially if you don't have a lot of cards,
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.620]   opening a new card can actually bring it up.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.460]   - Yeah.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.740]   And like you said, you might get dinged five points
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.580]   or something when you open a new card,
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.180]   but that is super short term.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.060]   Like in a couple of months, it will restore back.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.300]   As I said earlier, I got 19 or 20 credit cards
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.220]   and credit score is not crazily high
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.420]   'cause I don't have a mortgage yet,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   but it's 770, 765 because my credit utilization
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.180]   is something like $200,000.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.380]   Well, like my available credit that I could use,
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.740]   but clearly I'm not spending anywhere near that per month.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.980]   If you're the type of person listening here
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.940]   where having $200,000 of credit means you'll spend it,
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.180]   this is not a good episode for you.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.960]   - Yeah, I agree with that one.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.860]   - It's a shame when you came over to the US at the beginning,
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.300]   there's a company now, a guy I know actually started
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.900]   this company called Nova Credit,
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.740]   and they partnered with Amex
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.540]   and a few other credit card issuers,
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.080]   and they actually will use data from overseas agencies,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.020]   convert it to a format that the banks here understand.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.940]   And so if you go to Nova, you can say, I'm from the UK,
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.580]   here's all my UK information, and Nova will bridge the gap
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.380]   so that you can open up a card in the US,
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.300]   even though you have no credit history.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.940]   I know that didn't exist when you came over,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.580]   but if anyone here is new to the US right now listening,
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.300]   Nova Credit is a great company
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.580]   that lets you leverage your overseas credit
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.860]   to open cards up here.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.020]   - That's really cool, and it'll make your life a lot easier.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.700]   The other option, just real quick,
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.820]   is that secured credit cards are really good.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.260]   So I was helping out a business friend the other day
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.300]   who was like, "Ugh, English guy, my credit sucks."
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   And I was like, "Well, you could just get
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.260]   "a secured credit card," which basically means
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.860]   that you put down this deposit that you give to the bank.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.260]   So if things go bad, they know that they can take your 200
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.860]   and pay off whatever you charge to the card.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.820]   But if you basically just use that,
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.500]   even that small credit limit, 200, it's not super useful,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.820]   but if you put $50 on, pay it off.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.340]   You put $100 on, pay it off.
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.180]   If you do that for under a year,
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.060]   that will really increase your credit score as well.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.660]   - Yeah, it's effectively a debit card
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.940]   in that you can only spend the money
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.540]   you've put on deposit with the bank,
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.980]   but it builds your credit in a way
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.260]   that a debit card doesn't.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.300]   - Yeah, 'cause debit cards never help with credit.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.620]   - You all know I love credit card points,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.540]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.180]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.940]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.100]   all of your credit cards in one place
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.220]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.840]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.060]   You can also load it on your partner's phone
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.040]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.020]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.420]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.260]   and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.620]   Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.100]   to save even more money every day.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.620]   And with their browser extension,
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.220]   you can actually activate every single Amex and Chase offer
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.820]   in just one click.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.300]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.340]   you can do all of this without having
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.340]   to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.140]   The app is free to download,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.540]   and many of the features are free as well,
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.300]   but if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.620]   there's a free trial.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.420]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.100]   which you probably will,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.060]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.760]   to get 20% off.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.780]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.620]   I get it.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.300]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.180]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.260]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.220]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.140]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.100]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.860]   take care of the supplies.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.680]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.540]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.940]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.920]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.380]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.460]   that you got through another week.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.580]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.100]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.880]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.980]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.620]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.200]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.180]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.220]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.060]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.100]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.760]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.240]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.880]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.180]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.400]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.340]   So before we jump into points cards,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.740]   which I think offer tremendous value,
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.040]   I meet a lot of people who,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.700]   they think they're playing the rewards game
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.460]   'cause they have a card that earns them
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.180]   one or 2% cash back or 1.5% cash back.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.140]   I know points can, you know,
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.580]   flexible points, transferable points,
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.460]   they can earn a lot more than that.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.700]   But is there a type of person
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.900]   where earning 1.5, 2% cash back
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.180]   is actually the right path forward for them?
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.500]   - Yeah, I think it's good for people
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.500]   who just want things to be ridiculously simple.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.780]   Like, there's no way of turning cash back
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.060]   into something complex.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.940]   When you get the cash back,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.700]   you can use it for either travel or non-travel.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.540]   But if, and especially,
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.620]   I think cash back is useful for those who,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.300]   and maybe not too many of those
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.580]   who will listen to this podcast,
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.620]   who don't actually want to earn points for travel
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.420]   or don't want to travel that much.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.900]   But yeah, it's really just simplicity.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.940]   Like, you know, the Citi double cash card,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.660]   like 2% on any purchase, no limitations.
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.980]   It's super duper simple.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   - And it's just not the way
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.940]   you're going to earn the most points, right?
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.060]   - No, you can't, like, you can't get, you know,
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.820]   outsized value with cash back.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.780]   Like, it's not a great tool for me
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.940]   and for many optimizers in this kind of space.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.820]   Yeah, it's not going to get you too far.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.940]   - I think points have had a reputation in the past
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.620]   of the only way you can use a point
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.380]   is if you fly on this one day in this one way.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.620]   But even most of the points cards these days
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.580]   offer some way to use your points
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.700]   towards reimbursing yourself
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.780]   or booking through a travel portal.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.980]   So you end up getting some of the benefit of cash back
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.780]   in that you could just buy a ticket and reimburse yourself
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.220]   or you can buy it without waiting
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.700]   for award space to open up.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   But you also get the huge bonuses
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.100]   when you're spending on these points cards,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.260]   which there's no cash back card I'm aware of
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.460]   that's giving you 5X back on your dollars.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.780]   - Exactly, so like, I was going to say,
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.340]   if you had, to add to your point,
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.220]   like if you had the Amex Gold, for example,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.660]   and you could earn four times points supermarket purchases,
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.740]   then if you wanted to use those points in the portal
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.340]   and you get one cent per point,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.540]   you're basically earning 4% cash back.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.060]   - Yeah, so even the points cards
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.620]   can be better cash back cards than the cash back cards,
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.100]   as long as you're spending money in one of these categories,
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.900]   which the biggest bonuses are in travel and dining
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.180]   and groceries and shop gas are big ones.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.540]   But yeah, I always tell people
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.740]   my favorite cash back card is my points card.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.580]   Now I just don't happen to use it like that.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.500]   But one thing, are all miles and points the same?
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.220]   I tend to think they're not.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.260]   And I'm curious if you have an attitude
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.860]   towards certain miles being more valuable
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.300]   to accumulate or points to accumulate than others.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.060]   - Yeah, so for me, flexible points and transferable points
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.260]   are by far the most valuable
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.620]   because you're able to not only use those
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.020]   for buying flights or hotel stays through portals,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.340]   through travel portals,
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.460]   but also this is the biggest takeaway,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.100]   like you can transfer those to their airline partners
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.060]   or hotel partners.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.940]   So Chase have 10 plus airline and hotel partners,
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.860]   Amex have considerably more,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.460]   Citi have their own bunch and so do Capital One.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.780]   So if you guys have any points that are sitting
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.820]   with Chase, Amex, Citi or Capital One now,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.580]   you can literally transfer them
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.100]   to a bunch of different airlines and hotels
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.820]   and get incredible value that way.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.100]   Most people are spending them in the portal
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.500]   or redeeming them terribly for gift cards.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.260]   - So gift cards aren't a good use of points?
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.140]   - Terrible, it's literally the worst thing you could do
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.300]   because you're getting less than one cent per point
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.580]   in redemption value.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.860]   So my general rule of thumb is that
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.020]   you wanna be getting about two cents in value per point,
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.900]   but the gift cards, I think you get 0.7 of a cent.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.860]   So a friend told me last year actually,
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.460]   he was like, "Oh, you'll be proud of me, Alex.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.060]   "I just redeemed 100,000 points for Amazon gift cards."
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.420]   I'm like, "I'm definitely not proud of you.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.020]   "That was a terrible decision."
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.060]   So yeah, the most amount of value
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.380]   is definitely with flexible points.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.060]   If you've got the less valuable ones,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.420]   they're definitely with the airlines
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.860]   because you can't transfer.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.260]   So many people think you can just transfer American Airlines
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.620]   to some other airline.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.500]   I'm like, "No, you can't."
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.940]   - If I have United Miles, I can book on their partners,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.900]   but if I have Chase Points,
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.820]   not only can I transfer them to United
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.340]   and book on their partners,
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.660]   but I can also transfer them to six or seven other airlines
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.900]   or hotel chains.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.740]   Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.420]   I always think I'd much rather have a Chase Point
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.780]   than a United Point
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.340]   because a Chase Point can be transferred
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.300]   to be a United Point.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.980]   You get all the benefits of a United Point
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.340]   with a Chase Point plus more.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.540]   - And the cool thing is, so this is a common one.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.700]   Most people who fly Southwest love Southwest.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.660]   It's just like this lovable brand.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.900]   And most people who fly them commonly
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.820]   will have a Southwest credit card and be like,
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.500]   "Okay, yeah, got the bonus.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.220]   "Using the card, life is great."
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.460]   And I'm like, "Do you want more Southwest points
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.940]   "because you like to fly with them?"
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.100]   And they're like, "Yeah, obviously I do."
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.060]   Why don't you sign up to a Chase credit card?
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.540]   You could use a Chase Alpha Reserve card, for example,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.420]   for getting 3X on dining expenses or travel expenses.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.100]   The Southwest, even if you book with Southwest,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.460]   they only give you two points per dollar spent.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.460]   So you can immediately add 50% more points
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.100]   by booking with the Chase Alpha Reserve.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.980]   If you got a Platinum, then you could get 5X
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.380]   by using that card to book your Southwest flight.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.860]   So you're just accumulating tons and tons of points
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.700]   through little adjustments like that.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.940]   If you love an airline,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.740]   don't think that having that airline credit card
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.860]   is all that you can do.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.660]   It's very common that you can collect transferable points
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.300]   and then transfer those directly into your airline account
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.900]   and top up your balances that way.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.420]   So, I mean, that's a real big one
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.340]   and something I've done for years.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.260]   - Yeah, I often tell people,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.620]   "Look, if you're really loyal to an airline or a hotel
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.820]   "and the card gives you tangible benefits for that,
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.620]   "whether it gives you access to the airline lounge
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.940]   "or it gets you free upgrades or free check bags,
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.740]   "those are things that you often won't get
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.260]   "with the Chase Ultimate Rewards card or the Amex card.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.180]   "But if you wanna earn the most points booking flights,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.140]   "it's almost always with a card
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.100]   "that isn't the airline's card."
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.900]   - Yeah, there's very few occasions
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.260]   where you want to use your airline card to pay for a flight.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.220]   Like you just said, you may get additional perks
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.900]   like lounge access or like priority boarding and stuff.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.740]   And that's cool.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.020]   That makes sense for people who regularly fly
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.220]   with an airline, but that card is not your strategy
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.740]   for accumulating the most valuable points.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.500]   It's going to be, in almost all scenarios,
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.340]   it's going to be collecting these
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.620]   or earning these transferable points instead.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.700]   That's how you can accumulate so many of these points.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.860]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.220]   And hotel cards, I think, are depending on the chain.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.100]   Like I know with my Marriott card,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.980]   I actually earn more points when I'm staying at a Marriott
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.860]   than I would if I used any other card and transferred back.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.940]   So I think that's one of a, you know, look into it,
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.140]   but for airline cards, it's pretty bad.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.980]   - Like hotel cards, you get that like free annual stay,
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.020]   like one night.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.940]   So if you've got one of the Marriott cards,
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.780]   they'll allow you to redeem for one night
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.180]   at any hotel in whatever category it might be,
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.700]   category one to four or something.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.100]   And that can have quite a lot of value, you know?
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.460]   That's often valued at double of whatever the annual fee is
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.660]   for most of the cards.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.900]   - You brought up a really good point there,
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.380]   which is a lot of people look at cards with annual fees
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.580]   and they think, "Gosh, this card's really expensive."
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.140]   And one thing, in the example you just gave,
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.340]   you might have a Marriott card that has a $95 annual fee,
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.460]   and you might say, "Oh, I'm not staying at enough Marriotts
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.340]   that the spending makes sense."
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.780]   But every year they might give you a free night
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.180]   that's worth two or $300.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.380]   And I often say, "Don't look at the annual fee.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.420]   Look at the annual fee minus whatever benefits you get."
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.180]   And so cards like the Chase Reserve card,
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.260]   it's an expensive annual fee,
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.700]   but they'll knock off the first $300 of travel spend.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.060]   So you can't really look at it as the whole fee.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.180]   You kind of have to look at it net
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.140]   of all of these things that come with it.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.220]   - Yeah, yeah, and that's what puts people off
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.300]   getting those more "luxury cards."
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.660]   People think, "Well, only rich people have an Amex Platinum.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.060]   That card isn't for me."
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.700]   And with a $550 annual fee, I mean, that is a lot,
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.540]   but it shouldn't be seen as this sunk cost
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.260]   that you can never get back.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.380]   First off, the sign-up bonuses for most of them
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.460]   would pay for the annual fee for several years,
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.580]   the value from that.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.740]   And then the Platinum, for example,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.460]   comes loaded with benefits.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.100]   And these cards make a lot of sense to a lot of people.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.380]   I mean, at the moment,
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.140]   because of obviously pandemic and everything,
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.740]   they're giving you credits, things like Uber Eats,
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.020]   and you get elite status of Hilton and Marriott,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.860]   like Gold Elite.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.700]   That's pretty cool.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.220]   If you stay at any of those hotels regularly,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.500]   then just instantly get Gold Elite by signing up.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.660]   That has a lot of value.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.180]   And then, yeah, some of those cards can give you,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.020]   like I said, like the Platinum,
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.020]   you can get 5X on booking flights.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.140]   If you book flights regularly,
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.020]   you're gonna get a whole ton of points from that,
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.460]   and that's extra value.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.460]   So try not to, yes, the annual fee is a real thing,
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.380]   you have to pay it.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.260]   But that card makes a lot of sense for people
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.700]   who can utilize those benefits.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.220]   And we easily get four times the amount of value back
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.020]   per year by using like the Platinum card, like effortlessly.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.020]   So yeah, like annual fees,
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.340]   like quite rightly put people off,
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.820]   but you gotta look at the benefits and the perks
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.100]   and see if that makes sense for you,
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.020]   'cause often you can just get
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.660]   so much more value back from them.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.980]   - And I'll just say one quick thing.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.060]   If you said the annual fee, you have to pay it,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.780]   but if you've had a card for a few years
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.020]   and you found that right now
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.020]   you're not getting a lot of value out of it,
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.180]   and you're thinking of canceling it
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.020]   before you do,
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.500]   it's always worth calling the credit card company
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.620]   and just saying, hey, look,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.460]   I didn't get a lot of value out of this.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.980]   I'm thinking of canceling
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.100]   unless there's something you could do.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.180]   And I've had annual fees refunded.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.060]   I've said, oh, go spend $1,000 in the next month
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.820]   and we'll give you 20,000 points.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.580]   And I'm not a fan of calling every year to threaten,
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.060]   but if I'm actually thinking of canceling something
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.940]   and there's an offer that's worth keeping it,
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.140]   I'm definitely all ears.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.180]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.900]   Like my strategy is very similar.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.500]   Basically within about one or two weeks
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.180]   of the annual fee kicking in,
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.500]   give them a call.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.540]   It helps you to actually use the card.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.020]   If it's $5,000 you've got to spend
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.860]   to get the signup bonus,
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.020]   don't spend 5,001 and then call them up
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.100]   and expect them to give you free statement credits
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.940]   and everything.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.700]   You want to use your card fairly regularly,
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.180]   but I'll phone up and I'll say,
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.340]   I'm not a hard baller either.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.180]   I'm terrible at that.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.340]   So I'll be like, you know what?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.260]   I love this card.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.780]   Once I had to phone up Amex because I needed some help.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.780]   The customer service agent was like amazing
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.700]   and it was great.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.140]   And yeah, I do use it, but you know what?
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.660]   I spend money in this certain category
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.140]   and this card doesn't really give me too much value back.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.660]   What can you do to sort of help me renew this?
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.740]   And if you just have a nice conversation
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.100]   and I find if you're not hard balling them.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   Yeah, I got like the first time I phoned up
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.140]   after getting the platinum,
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.820]   I phoned up and used the strategy.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.260]   I got 50,000 points for staying on.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.660]   And I was like, yes.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   - That was better than me.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.580]   I just got my $550 annual fee refunded.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.900]   - Well, that's super cool as well.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.140]   - I would have taken 50,000 points,
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.500]   which actually is a perfect segue.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.260]   So before we jump into just the best credit cards,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.620]   I'm curious if we could give people some examples
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.060]   of how valuable points can actually be.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.740]   When we talked about cash back,
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.260]   sure, you can get one, 2% cash back.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.220]   If you're accumulating points, I think it's possible.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.580]   You mentioned that platinum card
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.820]   can give you five points on travel.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.580]   The reserve can give you three on dining.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.260]   But the real magic I think comes from spending those points
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.340]   by transferring them to airlines or hotels
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.740]   and taking really epic adventures.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.380]   And I think it's cool to really make it clear
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.980]   how valuable that can be.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.060]   So I'll give one example and I wanna hear what yours are.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.420]   And maybe we'll just share a few
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.740]   to give people an idea of how cool this can be.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.780]   Mine is my honeymoon.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.220]   We wanted to go to the Seychelles,
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.420]   which we'd never even heard of,
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.900]   but we were, let's take the most exotic crazy trip we can.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.540]   And it's an island off the Eastern coast of Africa.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.300]   And we booked it on Air France in business class.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.580]   The flights were about 11 or $12,000 round trip
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.980]   if we wanted to pay for them.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.820]   And they were 120,000 points
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.020]   for us just buying them with dollars,
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.500]   which that's gone up a little bit since then,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.900]   but that's almost 10 cents per point.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.460]   So if you look at a card that's earning four points
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.300]   per dollar, if you can earn 10 cents
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.580]   for each of those points,
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.180]   you're effectively getting 40% cash back.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.940]   And we took it one step further.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.260]   We knew that this was such a good deal
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.620]   and we wanted a wedding videographer
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.620]   and our wedding videographer, we couldn't afford.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.540]   And so she had told me in passing
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.100]   that she also wanted to go to the Seychelles
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.940]   and we didn't go on a trip with her,
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.620]   but we said, what if you do the wedding videography for free
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.460]   and we'll send you and your husband
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.860]   to the Seychelles as well on a future trip.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.180]   And so we ended up spending at that time,
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.260]   it was like 480,000 Amex points,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.860]   but we got about $48,000 of value,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.180]   which for me was like the best redemption of all time.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.020]   What about you?
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.340]   - Yeah, and you said 10 cents per point of value.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.020]   Remember the portal gives you a whopping like one.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.860]   And gift cards.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.100]   - Don't buy gift cards, don't buy gift cards.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.460]   - Gift cards is even worse.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.900]   So yeah, I've been very fortunate.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.500]   Like I've done a ton of business first class travel.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.340]   Certainly a memorable one is a round the world trip
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.420]   that I did with my wife.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.100]   My oldest brother actually lives in Vietnam.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.700]   So we went to go see him
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.060]   and then went to go see some friends in Sydney, Australia,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.580]   and then also combine that with going to the Middle East.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.580]   And basically for 310,000 miles per person,
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:49.460]   we paid just over a grand in taxes and fees.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   We got to fly Singapore Suites First Class.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.520]   - By the way, for anyone listening,
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.400]   Singapore Suites First Class is not a bigger seat, right?
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.480]   This is a bed.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.560]   - Yeah, a double bed. - And a chair.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.400]   Yeah, a double bed.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.360]   You could put these together
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.040]   and you have a double bed on an airplane.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.960]   So for anyone who hasn't had the chance
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.960]   to see these kind of really ridiculous
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.240]   international first class,
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.360]   this is nothing like the first four seats you walk by
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.120]   when you get on a domestic flight.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.240]   This is a whole nother level.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.920]   - So yeah, Singapore Suites was absolutely incredible.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.040]   We also got to fly Etihad's apartment,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.200]   which words can't even describe
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.920]   how ridiculous that cabin is.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.520]   And they got showers and everything,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.160]   and butlers and all this stuff.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.760]   - Is that the one with the door,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.600]   and then you have a little living area,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.020]   and then you have your own bathroom and your own bedroom?
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.680]   - Yeah, so well, that's the residence
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.160]   where you got the bedroom as well.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.080]   - Oh, okay, okay.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.840]   - It's everything you just said, minus the bedroom.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.800]   It's so ridiculous.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.480]   And actually for that specific flight,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.160]   it ended up being 100,000 points and $500 in cash.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.600]   Like who would not pay $500 to like fly 14 hours?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.840]   We were just like, this can't be happening.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.120]   This is so ridiculous.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   - And not only by the way, on these flights,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.360]   are you getting these amazing,
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.480]   like you have a chair, you have a bed,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   they're usually pouring you like Dom Perignon,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.120]   like you're getting like more value than just that.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.200]   And in some of these airlines,
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.040]   they will pick you up at home in a town car or a limo
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.720]   and bring you to the airport.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.240]   You'll get the lounges at the airport.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.700]   Some of the lounges I've been in have massages.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.680]   So like some of these real premium
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.760]   international first-class trips
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   are way more than the mind can sometimes imagine.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   - And for all those miles, so it's 300,000 each,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.600]   but so not quite done yet.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.400]   So we did the Singapore suites,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.960]   we did the Etihad apartment,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.720]   and then on my birthday from Dubai back over to,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.920]   we flew back into LAX, it was my 33rd birthday.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.320]   We flew Emirates first,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.160]   and that is the most blingy over-the-top experience.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   The cabin crew are just incredible.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.360]   You can go up to the bar
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.600]   and start ordering Dom Perignon champagne cocktails,
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.000]   which is completely unnecessary.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.840]   If you can do it, why not?
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.920]   - And by bar, like this is a bar on the plane.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.320]   - A bar on the plane, yeah.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.840]   It's like at the back
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.560]   and business class and first class can go there.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.320]   But if your first class are like,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.200]   "Oh, make sure he gets the Dom Perignon."
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.880]   It's just so over the top.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.920]   And they have showers too, with like heated floors.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.480]   And it's just way too much space.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.880]   The size of the bathroom
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.640]   is probably the equivalent of like nine economy seats.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.560]   So it's very, very luxurious and very amazing.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.600]   So the cost of all of that for two people,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   it would have cost us $55,000 if we had paid in cash.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.080]   It ended up being $2,000 between us
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.440]   for all the taxes and fees.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.480]   And by the way, all of those flights,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.520]   and there was a few I didn't mention,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.800]   like Singapore business,
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.360]   the economy price of them was over 4,000.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.440]   So we actually paid half of what it would have cost
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.200]   to have flown all of those in economy.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.240]   So it just blows my mind.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.480]   And actually a lot of those,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.080]   people might look at that trip and be like,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.000]   "Well, that's just, that's pretty aggressive.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.840]   What can I do with that bit of information?"
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.400]   So you could take one of those flights.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.320]   Okay, my goal is to fly Emirates first.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.560]   I wanna go from say Houston or Boston over to Dubai.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.920]   Let's do it.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.760]   You can totally, that's so achievable.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.600]   That actually, since we're talking about it,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.240]   like that Emirates flight might cost about,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.520]   at the moment, it's about 130,000 points each way.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.800]   So it's one of the more expensive ones,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.120]   but it's $56 in taxes and fees.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.160]   They've just reduced those massively.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.760]   And you can transfer your points from Chase, for example,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.600]   like over to Emirates, or you,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.800]   or these are like $10,000 flights.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.600]   Oh, these are not cheap flights with dollars.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.120]   It's, even if you could afford that,
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.600]   like me and my wife play this silly game
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.880]   when we're waiting to get on a flight.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.480]   We're like, it's called points or cash.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   It's a very simple game.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.360]   We literally look around and we're like,
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.920]   "Oh, that person looks like, you know,
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.800]   wearing a suit and stuff, looks smart.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.920]   Clearly going to business class
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.000]   'cause he's lining up for business.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.840]   What do you reckon?
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.680]   Points or cash?"
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.960]   To me, it's so obvious when someone is using cash
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.640]   'cause I don't know.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.400]   I feel like that person is just not like an optimizer.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.240]   And-
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.040]   Anyway, has there ever been a contentious episode
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.680]   of points or cash where both of you
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.240]   were so sure you were right,
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.400]   but you thought the opposite,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.040]   that you had to ask the person?
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.880]   (laughs)
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.720]   No, yeah.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.160]   We've definitely had a little bit of an argument about it,
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.200]   but I didn't have the guts
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.440]   to actually go and ask the person.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.160]   I was like, "Hey, yeah, I hope you enjoy your first class."
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.120]   Leaning over, trying to look at his ticket,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.720]   see if you could glance a view.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.400]   But yeah, like just,
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.480]   you could book like that Emirates first.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.360]   If you find a what space where you could book it
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.520]   for 130,000,
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.840]   if you've got a big signup bonus
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.520]   or you've been using a card that rewards you
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.040]   for the areas that you spend the most money in,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.720]   like these are super attainable.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.080]   It's almost like they're so over the top, these products,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.840]   that you look at people in them in images or videos
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.640]   and you think, "Categorically could not do that."
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.600]   Like, you know, I run my site, Upgrading Points,
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.160]   and we get comments from people saying, "You're just rich."
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.520]   That doesn't work.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.360]   I'm like, "Oh, could you just check out this article
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.280]   where we do literally like a step-by-step,
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.480]   this is how you book Etihad or Emirates
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.040]   or Singapore or something."
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.320]   And then they come back and they're like, "Oh, okay, amazing.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.480]   Like I didn't actually realize that this was attainable
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.760]   or the conversation goes very quiet."
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.040]   - Yeah, I always say once you get a taste of business class,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.160]   it's like, God, business or first
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.880]   is the only way I want to cross an ocean.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.640]   But if you don't play the points game,
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.920]   that can be pretty expensive.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.800]   If anyone's listening doesn't have a good sense
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.680]   that you can go on amazing vacations for free,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.080]   then, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.200]   So is there any trip you like really want to take
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.680]   with your points?
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.640]   - Yeah, funny you asked that, Ashley,
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.720]   because I'm in the middle of trying to find
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.640]   some award space to get onto ANA's first class products
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.840]   and then fly back in business
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.200]   'cause I want to experience both.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.000]   They have a new products for business and first,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.880]   and there is an amazing,
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.440]   this is probably like the best redemption option
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.600]   out there at the moment.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.560]   So even though this doesn't make any sense
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.320]   and it's feasible because of the partnerships
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.040]   that airlines have with each other,
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.320]   you can transfer from Chase 120,000 points
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.520]   to your Virgin Atlantic account
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.880]   and book ANA first class round trip.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   So 60,000 points each way to Japan from the US.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.080]   And literally like if you go and Google
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.840]   like an ANA first class cash price,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.440]   I don't think you'll ever find one
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.120]   that's under 10 grand like each way.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.640]   Like it's obscenely expensive.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.560]   And for 120,000 points, again, I don't fly ANA.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.840]   So I haven't earned those points by flying them
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   or using their credit card.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   I've transferred them from Chase,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.240]   these transferable amazing points.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.720]   And that's what I'm looking at.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.040]   I've also got a Singapore first trip booked
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.320]   for like later this year.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.520]   I don't know whether I'll take it or not
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.320]   'cause of obviously the current environment,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.840]   but I booked that a while ago.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.400]   So I'm super excited if that materializes.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.240]   - Yeah, so it's clear that there's incredible value
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.160]   from credit card points
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.600]   and using them to take amazing vacations.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.680]   I feel like now's the time to ask,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.080]   what are the best cards now?
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.440]   I've been so out of the loop for the last 18 months
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.760]   with a new child, a new job, the pandemic.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.800]   You run a site about this.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.160]   What are the best points cards right now?
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.360]   - Yes, I really like the Amex Gold card.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.040]   I think they've done an amazing job
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.400]   with it over the years.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.480]   So the Amex Gold will get you four times points
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.880]   when you're spending money at supermarkets,
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.320]   but also restaurants.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.360]   And then you'll get three points per dollar spent
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.960]   flights and travel if you book through their portal.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.160]   But you also get Uber Eats free pass
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.640]   and then $10 a month credit.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.080]   And the signup bonus is pretty generous
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.160]   at the moment as well.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.400]   So the Amex Gold is like a great kind of everyday
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.800]   because I feel like most people shop at grocery stores
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.000]   like somewhat regularly and go to restaurants
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.480]   and so forth and obviously book travel.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.000]   So the Amex Gold I really like.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.680]   And again, remember like Amex have a ton
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.600]   of airline and hotel transfer partners.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.640]   So you're earning points fast
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.440]   and then you've got so many different ways
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.920]   that you can use those.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.040]   I also like, like on the Chase side,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.200]   I do the Chase Afro Reserve.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.600]   You get three points per dollar spent
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.200]   on like dining and travel.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.960]   When people start like using Lyft
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.880]   and things like that a lot more,
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.600]   you get 10 times points per dollar spent on Lyft travel,
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.920]   which is really cool.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.040]   And then as you mentioned earlier,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.160]   as part of the annual fee,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.320]   you get $300 that you can use towards travel.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.680]   But actually at the moment, they've sweetened that deal.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.400]   You can use that towards grocery and like gas expenses.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.480]   So it's really easy to use up that $300,
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.520]   which is eroding that annual fee.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.120]   So those are some really good cards.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.400]   If you wanna step it up,
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.760]   oh, by the way, the Sapphire Reserve
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.840]   is great for lounge access.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.680]   You get into those,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.640]   you've probably heard of like priority pass lounges.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.920]   There's 1,200, 1,300 of them around the world.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.920]   So that's great if you want to be relaxing in a lounge
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.160]   when you're at the airport.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.520]   And then to be honest,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.560]   like one of my favorites for sure,
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.320]   and I can't not mention is the Amex Platinum
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.280]   because it is the best card for lounge access
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.040]   because not only do you get access
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.000]   to all the priority pass,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.640]   you get into the amazing Centurion lounges,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.160]   which I absolutely love.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.520]   They're just super crisp, run very well,
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.000]   really delicious food and unlimited drinks.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.720]   And even some of them have like spas
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.320]   and showers and so forth.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.400]   And they've got a bunch now.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.960]   I don't remember specifically how many,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.320]   but it's at least a dozen
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.200]   and they keep popping up everywhere.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.880]   I'm waiting for one to come to Austin,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.400]   but fingers crossed on that.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.560]   - I have the Platinum.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.880]   And the only caveat I'll say is,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.720]   I view it with the exception
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.920]   of getting five points on flights,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.960]   which is huge if you book a lot of flights, right?
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.760]   Other cards you might earn three,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.560]   five is definitely the most that I'm aware of.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.560]   But other than that, I think the Platinum card,
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.960]   I view it more as a perks card.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.000]   There's a lot of credits for things that you can buy.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.880]   Right now, every month you get $30 off PayPal,
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.400]   you get $50 or off at Saks Fifth Avenue.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.360]   So there's just credits and perks and lounge access,
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.080]   but I don't actually, other than flights,
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.200]   put any money on my Platinum card.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.640]   It's not the card that you wanna use
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.800]   to start accruing and earning loads of points.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.640]   Like you said, it's the benefits and the perks card
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.560]   because remember too,
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.600]   with those benefits that you had mentioned,
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.680]   you get the hotel elite status,
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.240]   you get gold elite at Hilton and Marriott.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.200]   Pretty cool 'cause those statuses give you upgrades
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.080]   and all the rest of it,
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   and earning more points when you stay there.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.200]   That's where the gold comes in because you're rewarded.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.240]   I use the gold to accrue loads of points
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.720]   and then I'm cashing in my benefits as it were,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   using the Platinum.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   So yeah, those are a couple of the cards
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.000]   that are really hot right now.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.840]   - Yeah.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.600]   So you mentioned the Amex Gold,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.120]   you mentioned the Chase Reserve,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.440]   our two great earning cards.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.560]   The categories are a little overlap, right?
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.400]   So you've got restaurants on both,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.700]   you've got travel on the Reserve,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.040]   you've got groceries on the Gold.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.320]   Is there a card you think is a good complimentary card
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.640]   for all that other spending
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.920]   that doesn't fall into a category?
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.800]   Whether it's a drug store,
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.640]   whether it's Home Depot,
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.800]   whether it's shopping online,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.920]   do you use those cards for those purchases
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.040]   or what do you do?
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.360]   - Yeah, so I'll have...
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.120]   So for example, I've got the Chase Freedom Unlimited,
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.640]   which is like my cashback card.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.240]   I'll use that card to get me at least 1.5% cashback.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   But what's really cool is that
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.760]   if you had the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.400]   or the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.440]   or a number of Chase's business cards
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.120]   that carry an annual fee,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.560]   if you've accrued cashback with the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.360]   you can convert that cashback into points.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.760]   So for me, like I'm only using a cashback card
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.520]   if I can then later,
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.720]   if I need to convert that cashback into points.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.200]   And it's a little hack there
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.080]   because they never market this.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.920]   The Unlimited is marketed as a cashback card.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.880]   And by having another Chase card that has an annual fee,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.360]   you can convert it over and then like we've chatted about,
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.440]   you can use those points for incredible travel.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.880]   So I do like Freedom Unlimited.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.240]   Some people like if they truly want cashback,
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.080]   like they might use something
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.000]   like the Amex Blue Cash Preferred,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.680]   which gives you like 6% cashback on supermarkets.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.640]   That's pretty cool.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.920]   - I just wanna thank you, Quik,

[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.440]   or I have even a Chase Sapphire Preferred,
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.400]   the everyday spending card is the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.240]   - Yeah.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.560]   - Does Amex have a good kind of everyday points earning card
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.720]   for all those other categories?
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.560]   - No, not really.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.920]   Like they do on the business side.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.840]   So like for anyone who runs a business and is listening,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.520]   like the Blue Business Plus will just give you 2X
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.440]   on everything up to 50,000 in spend.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.560]   So that is one of my 19 cards.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.840]   And I just hit that 50 and then I put it in the sock drawer.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.480]   Like it's done.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.240]   That's another 100,000 Amex points like easily accrued.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.640]   - Just so people know,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.000]   you do need to have a business to do this,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.880]   but that business doesn't have to employ people.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.000]   If you have, you freelance on the side,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.920]   if you sell things on eBay,
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.720]   like anything that counts as a business
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.040]   can make you eligible for a business card.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.280]   I had a startup and I was able to get a business card,
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.960]   but before that I didn't.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.480]   But every now and then I did some consulting work
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.560]   for a few hours here and that counted.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.400]   And then at one point in time,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.600]   I drove for Lyft to make some extra cash
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.240]   during the New Year's season and that kind of stuff.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.400]   And I counted that as business.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.880]   So there are various ways.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.760]   It doesn't mean you have to own a company
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.360]   that employs people to necessarily be eligible
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.280]   for a business card.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.120]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.640]   We got an article that talks just about this actually,
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.120]   'cause it was a lot of people were asking about it.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.520]   And so yeah, you don't need any sort of like complex
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.920]   or big business at all.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.360]   And then you unlock like the business cards to be fair,
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.960]   like a super exciting because they have huge bonuses.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.880]   And then if you're a business owner too,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.360]   like in you're paying for Facebook ads or things like that,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.040]   like they reward you three times points per dollar spent.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.920]   One of the Amex Business Gold will give you four.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.280]   So if you're regularly spending in these categories,
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.200]   like business owners is like a whole kind of separate topic,
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.160]   but there's a ton of great cards.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.920]   - One thing that you've taught me in prior conversations
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.800]   that I wanna make sure is clear,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.120]   when you're using the Amex Gold,
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.680]   it works at groceries
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.600]   and you get four points per dollar at grocery stores,
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.480]   but it gets you nothing if you're going to Home Depot,
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.960]   it gets you nothing if you're going to any other drug store,
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.520]   but you can buy gift cards at the grocery store.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.280]   So the hack you taught me was go to the grocery store
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.520]   with your 4X points on groceries,
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.720]   buy your Home Depot gift cards,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.920]   and then go to Home Depot
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.880]   and pay for everything with gift cards.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.560]   And you can get the 4X without having to do it.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.720]   And that was like such a good hack.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.960]   - Yeah, this is one of the coolest hacks.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.800]   And by the way,
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.520]   it's not like something that's worked for six weeks
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.120]   and probably won't work again.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.080]   Like I've been doing this for at least eight years.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.480]   Whenever I make any purchase on Amazon,
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.280]   it's off the back of me buying a gift card
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.440]   at say a supermarket store or an office one.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.840]   I'll talk through the office one in a minute,
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.360]   but with the Gold, yeah, you get 4X at supermarkets.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.120]   They have tons of different gift cards there.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.440]   You can grab an Amazon one
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.880]   and then load up your Amazon account.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.720]   It's super easy.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.160]   It takes you like one minute. - Or iTunes.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.240]   - Or iTunes or the airlines as well.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.200]   So again, coming back to like,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.520]   why would you use the Southwest credit card
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.040]   to purchase a flight with them
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.360]   when you could just buy like a Southwest gift card
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.960]   or multiple of them and you get 4X on them?
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.680]   So it's a really sweet hack.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.240]   And there's so many retailers as well.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.080]   So it's not just like you're reduced
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.120]   to only a couple of options.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.200]   Amazon's the biggie
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.800]   'cause everyone spends money on Amazon.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.680]   You should not be just using like a normal credit card
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.360]   to get one point per dollar spent.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.320]   Load them up with these gift cards
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.160]   that you've earned like 4X off.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.320]   For business owners, you can get like the Ink Cash,
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.080]   which gives you five times points at office stores.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.480]   So I go there all the time
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.840]   and I load up on some of the same similar retailers.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.040]   So that's a way for me to like top up my chase points
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.000]   by going to the office store to buy those gift cards.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.360]   And then on the Amex side,
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.760]   I can go to the supermarkets, right?
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.360]   And get 4X off and be getting the gift cards that way.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.400]   And this is not like cutting out a coupon
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.120]   or spending hours doing something like that.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.800]   If you go to the supermarket to buy food,
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.360]   just throw some gift cards in, like job done.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.080]   Like they don't give you hassle about it.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.880]   - Any other hacks to earn extra points beyond spending?
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.120]   - Yeah, this one's kind of cool.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.840]   So if you hold something like one of the Platinums
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.080]   or if you hold actually the gold card,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.320]   when you log into your Amex account,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.160]   they may have said,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.720]   "Hey, do you wanna sign up to our pay over time feature?"
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.040]   Which basically means that if you've made a purchase
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.960]   of $100 or more, you can pay it over time,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.120]   which we don't wanna do because that would mean
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   that you're paying interest and all that horrible stuff.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.000]   But by simply just saying,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.560]   "Yes, I would like the ability to be able to do this."
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.280]   They can give you 20,000 bonus points.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.040]   So I've done this on multiple cards.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.040]   So I've racked up like at least 40,000 points by doing this.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.760]   And again, you don't even like,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.960]   I've never used pay over time
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.000]   'cause I pay off my statement every single month.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.880]   But by just saying, "Yes, I would like the option to,"
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.800]   that you can get up to 20,000 points.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.160]   So go into your account, check to see if you've had it.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.800]   There's also a way to,
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.720]   they have a link that you can click on.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.320]   You can just go to our site or you can Google it
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.040]   and find out what link that you'd have to click
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.600]   to see if you're targeted for that offer.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.840]   'Cause it is a targeted offer.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   But in my experience,
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.120]   almost everyone gets offered that at some point.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.720]   - I also love the offer section.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   So when you're logged into Amex or Chase,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.240]   they give you all these offers.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.600]   And I feel like a year or two ago,
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.200]   it was these crappy offers,
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.640]   spend $300 on flowers and get $10 back.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.520]   But this year, at least with Amex,
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.880]   I've gotten a $100 off a Best Buy purchase of $100.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.320]   I've gotten $100 at Dell off $100,
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.240]   $100 at Home Depot off $100.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.400]   So I've probably gotten three or $400 back
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.160]   from my platinum card on purchases I already had to make.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.080]   This microphone I'm talking on,
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.560]   I bought at Dell and got the entire purchase refunded.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.000]   And there's no cost to adding these things.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.120]   So every month I log in, I'm like,
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.560]   are there offers to add?
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.520]   I'm tempted to just add all of them
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.960]   just in case I go buy something online.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.400]   - Side note, you can only add 100 to one card.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.240]   - Okay.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.080]   - But 100 is a lot.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.600]   - So of course Alex knows the answer, he's tried.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.200]   - Yeah, a member of our Facebook group said,
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.640]   oh, what's going on?
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   I can't add any more Amex offers to my card.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.480]   I was like, how many do you have?
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.640]   Screenshot 100, I was like, yeah, you've got enough of it.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.600]   Yeah, there's some really good ones.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.680]   I added, Hyatt have got one at the moment.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.120]   So spend 300 and get 60 back.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.360]   So 20% off basically, which is super cool.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.320]   There's loads of ones around like Booz
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.120]   and Wine.com and everything like that.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.800]   But oh yeah, this was a cool one.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.600]   So with my Amex Gold, you get $10 per month
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.960]   that you can spend on Uber Eats just by having the card.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.720]   But they've also got an Amex offer,
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.040]   which I've added to my card that enables you,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.640]   I think you get, I don't know, like $5 back
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.400]   for every 15 that you spend.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.200]   And you can do this five times.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.600]   Not only are you getting the monthly credit
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.640]   with just by having the card,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.400]   I'm stacking that with this Amex offer
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.280]   that then gives me like $5 back for every 15.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.480]   Yeah, there are some great offers and you're right.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.880]   They're so aggressive with them now.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.520]   There's just so many of them and they're easier to find.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.240]   Like they used to be buried, chase it behind.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.760]   Like chase offers suck.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.720]   They're really not very good.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   The other stacking thing, a lot of these points portals
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.360]   and airlines have these shopping portals.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.400]   And I always say, before you buy anything online,
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   make sure there's not some website
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.720]   that has a browser extension
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   or a link you can click to earn more.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.360]   And oftentimes I think some of the,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.360]   I go to cashback monitor and look at
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.480]   who has the highest percent cashback.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.040]   And oftentimes the cashback makes sense.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.320]   But if you're someone who's new to points
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.880]   and you're just trying to see
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.920]   how quickly can I get to my goal for this trip,
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.280]   whether it's a hundred, 200,000 points,
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.760]   you can go to Chase and click on a link at Chase's website
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.320]   to some retailer online, like Macy's,
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.240]   to go buy a gift for someone and they're on the holidays.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.920]   And I might earn three, four, five points per dollar spent.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.440]   And then I can pay for it with my Chase card
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.960]   and earn another one or two points per dollar.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.760]   The shopping portals can be a great way
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.120]   to accelerate your points earning.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.240]   - Yeah, and with the portals as well like this,
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.040]   you might not earn thousands and thousands of dollars
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.240]   by doing this once, but since we all online shop,
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.600]   just have a quick check to see
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.800]   if there's a multiplier bonus happening
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.360]   at one of the shopping portals.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.000]   This is literally how you start racking up
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.360]   thousands of points over the year.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.880]   Because now when you're buying something online,
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.200]   you're maybe going through a portal.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.840]   If you're going to Amazon, well, wait a minute,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.160]   I've got my gift cards at the supermarket.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.640]   And when I'm booking a flight, like I'm getting 5X points,
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.040]   like all of these different strategies together,
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.440]   this is how, as I say, rack up tons and tons of points.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.400]   So the shopping portals is good.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.240]   They also have the dining programs as well.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.080]   - Oh yeah.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.200]   - Not quite as exciting,
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.600]   but you just basically add your card
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.280]   to specific airlines or hotels dining program.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.800]   And then if you were to go to one of the restaurants
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.680]   in their network, they will give you bonus points
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.920]   for every dollar that you spent
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.720]   on top of whatever that card gives you.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.680]   So for example, with the gold,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.400]   if you went and dined at a restaurant
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.240]   that was part of American Airlines' dining portal program,
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.960]   you would earn four on the card.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.480]   And then for all of that restaurant
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.680]   could be giving you five on top of it.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.960]   So you come out with nine times points per dollar spent.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.200]   And over the course of the months and the years,
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.440]   like you really do earn loads and loads of points.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.880]   So I like to use those as well.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.120]   - So you have 19 cards.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.440]   I assume you have points across many different programs.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.520]   Is there any easy way that you can organize all of that
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.960]   and keep track of where your points are?
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   How many you have?
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.040]   Is there anything that makes that simple?
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.560]   - Yeah, so I like to use Award Wallet.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.280]   They have a pretty good feature there
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.960]   where you can just load up all of your accounts
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.600]   and then they'll automatically check those accounts
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.680]   periodically to give the most recent balances that you have.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.720]   And so you can see like in one screen,
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.320]   oh, here are all my different accounts.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.640]   Here's the total that I have.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.480]   That's cool.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.600]   If you take it to the extreme like me,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.200]   it can quickly get out of hand
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.880]   and you need to be a little bit organized.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.240]   Or you can do things like spreadsheets
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.480]   and just like once a month you do like a quick balance check.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.120]   But I do, yeah, I do that feature
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.680]   that they have at Award Wallet.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.080]   - I know when you transfer points from Amex or Chase
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.120]   to different airlines,
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   you're still relying on the availability of award travel,
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.360]   which sometimes might not be open the days you wanna fly.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.240]   If you wanna just fly whenever you can
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.960]   and you don't want all those restrictions,
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.720]   is there a way to use your points,
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   either the shopping portal or the travel portal
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.200]   or something that still makes it better
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.400]   than a cash back card?
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.920]   Or if I wanna be able to fly on any flight at any time,
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.120]   am I actually better off just getting cash back?
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.840]   - Well, remember the points cards in the first place
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.280]   are gonna earn you more points
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.520]   for every dollar that you spend.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.160]   So you're already ahead by choosing a points card.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.360]   So if you decide then to use that
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.360]   in the most simplistic way in a travel portal,
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.320]   you're gonna end up like getting the most amount of value.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.240]   And the great thing about the portals
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:49.400]   is that there are essentially like no blackout dates,
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.480]   like no restrictions.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.400]   And you can book pretty much any flight that you want.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.440]   I mean, Chase is literally port with Expedia.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.720]   So it's like you're using Expedia.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.080]   - And what kind of value do you get?
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.320]   - If you have the Chase offer reserved,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.040]   you'll get 1.5 cents per point in value,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.000]   which is awesome considering that you may have earned
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.200]   three times points on travel purchases
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.720]   and dining purchases.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.000]   So each of those points is then being redeemed
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.240]   at one and a half.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.520]   I'm not a very good mathematician,
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.520]   but I think that works out
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   to getting a 4.5% cash back essentially.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.280]   - Yeah, even if you can go on the most optimal trip,
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.240]   if you're as flexible as possible,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.240]   and you wanna say I'll go anywhere in the world
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.120]   in first class on any day,
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.400]   you're gonna get the most points
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.240]   if you transfer to an airline.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.560]   And we should do a whole episode
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.120]   on how to do those transfers,
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.520]   how to find that availability,
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.360]   and that'll come soon and stay tuned
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.600]   'cause we won't get into that at all today.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.920]   But even if you just book through the portal,
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.680]   you're getting four and a half, maybe five,
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.800]   if it was a platinum card, maybe more,
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.920]   like you can still get a value that's greater
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.040]   than just getting one and a half or two cents back.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.600]   So Chase Reserve, Amex Gold,
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.160]   great cards for earning points,
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.640]   platinum, great card for perks.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.480]   The other big way to accrue points
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.200]   is not just spending on your credit card,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.640]   but the huge signup bonuses you get signing up for cards.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.840]   I remember one time in the same day,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.760]   I signed up for three Citi American Airline cards
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.680]   and earned something like 75,000 each
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.840]   for 225,000 points in one go.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.120]   And the requirement was to spend two or $3,000
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.760]   over a period of time, which I was able to do.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.360]   I know that's a huge way people gain points.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.680]   Are there any big signup bonuses now?
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.640]   So right now there are some incredible bonuses
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.560]   that are happening.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.160]   The Chase Sapphire Preferred, like the 80,000 points,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.040]   it's always like 60,000.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.840]   So you get like another 20,000, which is really cool.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.520]   And then the Amex Platinum,
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.720]   they bump that up from like the usual 60,000 to 75,000.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.240]   And on our website, we actually have an article
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.560]   on how you can get up to 125,000 points
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.480]   from the Amex Platinum.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.680]   There's a super cool way of getting a targeted offer.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.800]   We'll put that and everything we've discussed
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.000]   will all be in the show notes.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.840]   Check it out.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.680]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.720]   Because if you're gonna sign up for the Platinum,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   one thing I haven't mentioned
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.880]   is that you can only get a signup bonus
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.520]   from a card once in your lifetime.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.000]   So better make sure that with something
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.560]   like the Amex Platinum that you reach
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.440]   for that 100,000 points or minimum 75,000,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   don't settle for that 60,000 points.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.560]   The Amex Gold has also bumped theirs up.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:33.120]   I think it's usually 35,000 and they've got that at 60,000.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.440]   Like literally like every card,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.880]   nearly every card has increased their bonuses right now.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.600]   And it's the banks catching up
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.360]   to all the stuff that happened in the pandemic.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.160]   So if you're thinking about jumping on a card,
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.640]   I would massively recommend that you look into it ASAP
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.280]   because the bonuses are just so strong.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.360]   Like the Chase Afro Reserve has bumped up to like 60,000
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.920]   and it's usually at 50.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.320]   Business cards are big as well.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.040]   Like the Inc Business preferred 100,000 points
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.360]   for a $95 annual fee card.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.760]   Like the 100,000 points, even if you use them
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.520]   in the worst possible way, is worth over $1,000.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.360]   Even if that was for like, I think gift cards
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.680]   would be maybe a little bit less, but don't be doing that.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.760]   If you used it in the portal, it'd be $1,250.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   So big, big bonuses.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.560]   Honestly, there aren't that many cards
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.680]   that haven't increased their offer right now.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.120]   - And one thing, I think this,
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.320]   correct me if this isn't true anymore,
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.400]   but I know Chase has a pretty hard rule
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.000]   when you're opening new cards
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.080]   that if you've opened more than five cards
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.800]   in the last two years, you're not gonna get another one.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.920]   Is that still the way they operate?
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   - Yeah, they call it the 5/24 rule.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.680]   It's not an official rule, but it's basically
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.720]   like what the optimizers have found out.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.440]   What makes this relevant to you is that
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.840]   if you're thinking of getting a few Chase cards,
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.120]   get those first before you then jump on say an Amex card
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.880]   or a Citi card or whatever.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.480]   'Cause if you take out more than five cards
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.560]   in a 24 month period, you're not gonna be able
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.640]   to take out that Chase card that you're looking at.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.480]   So that's why, if you love the Chase Sapphire Preferreds,
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.680]   80,000 bonus points, but you also like the Amex Gold
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.320]   and maybe you've taken out a few cards
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   in the last year or two, grab that Sapphire Preferred first
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.560]   and then get the Amex afterwards.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.080]   - I just saw an ad yesterday
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.760]   for the Capital One Venture card, 100,000 points.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.720]   Does that have a place?
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.640]   We haven't talked about that card at all.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.080]   - Yeah, so Capital One have really stepped up
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.200]   because now you can transfer miles that you accrue with them
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.520]   to airline and hotel partners, just like Chase,
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.080]   just like Citi, just like Amex.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.680]   Previously, they didn't do that.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.160]   So the points, the miles that you accrued,
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.240]   you would have to use the statement credits
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.600]   and things like that or something in their travel portal,
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.000]   which wasn't very valuable.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.360]   But now you can transfer them to partners.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.960]   So yes, like 100,000 points on a venture
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.560]   is a monster sign up.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.400]   It's a bonus.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.240]   And if you're looking at Capital One cards,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.760]   that could be a really good one.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.280]   Again, I think they have 15
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.640]   or 16 different transfer partners.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.080]   And a couple of years ago, they had none.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.520]   So they've realized that everyone is being lured in
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.120]   by Chase cards and Amex cards.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.880]   So that's great for the consumer
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.800]   because now the bonuses are going up
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.880]   because Capital One, like they want your business
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.840]   and then Chase are annoyed.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.440]   So they increase the sign up bonuses
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.960]   and make everything so much more lucrative.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   - It's great for us.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.600]   - It's so good for us.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.480]   If you look back five years ago,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   like it was pretty nuts to have 100,000 bonus.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.800]   And it was nuts to have four times points per dollar spent
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.880]   on things like supermarkets and dining and everything.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.600]   Like that almost didn't exist.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.920]   The competition has gone pretty crazy
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.120]   like this last five years.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.400]   So genuinely like now is a really good time
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.240]   to be looking at cards
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.800]   'cause those bonuses are massive
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.680]   and they've adjusted the benefits to the pandemic.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.560]   They're like not loads of people wanna travel.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.000]   So I'm gonna give you a ton of statement credits
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.040]   at grocery stores.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.000]   I'm gonna give you a bunch of stuff
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.960]   back on dining or delivery.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.760]   That's why all these Uber Eats passes
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.920]   are being marketed everywhere.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.520]   And that's why they've baked into a lot of these cards.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.240]   So to be fair, they've done a good job,
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.520]   the issuers of adjusting to the current environment.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.640]   And it makes those cards like to me, like even more useful.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.160]   - Yeah, I remember once I applied for a Chase card,
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.000]   I didn't get it.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.080]   I called up the reconsideration phone number
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.400]   which you can find just Googling around.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.480]   And I ended up getting them to reconsider
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.880]   and I got the card.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.640]   Is that something that still happens?
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.760]   Can you still do that?
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.600]   - So if you ever apply for a card
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.080]   and you're not instantly approved,
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.880]   you definitely wanna phone up the reconsideration line
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.320]   because often they just need a little bit more information.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.000]   And by giving that information
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.400]   it gives them enough confidence
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.440]   to then give you the approval for the card.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.720]   It doesn't always work.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.880]   Sometimes there's a legitimate reason
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.840]   why you haven't been accepted for a card
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.440]   but I always will phone up the reconsideration.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.160]   It's worked for a bunch of friends too.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   Definitely worth the time.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.920]   And actually you get through pretty quickly
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.160]   on reconsideration lines.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.640]   - So when you open these cards up for signup bonuses,
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.680]   if they're not cards
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.240]   that you necessarily spend regularly on,
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.440]   how long do you keep them open?
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.000]   Do you close them at the end of the year?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Do you close them as soon as the bonus posts?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.920]   - Yeah, so it used to be a lot more lax.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.600]   So you used to be able to just like sign up for the bonus,
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.200]   spend $1 more than like the minimum spend
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.440]   and then close it.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.680]   And the banks would be a bit annoyed
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.200]   or the airlines would be annoyed.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.360]   But it was fine.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.200]   You could do that.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.480]   Now it's much riskier.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.680]   So let's say for example,
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.520]   you get that 100,000 bonus for platinum
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.120]   and you wanna close it.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.800]   It is not unheard of for them
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.200]   to take that bonus back from you.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.280]   So my recommendation is that you wanna spend
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.400]   quite a bit more than the minimum spend on a card
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.520]   so that if you then later wanna close it,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.880]   you wouldn't run into any trouble.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.080]   Now to answer your question about what I do,
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.600]   if it's a no annual fee card, it is a sock draw card.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.360]   I keep it open because that helps with my credit.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.280]   Because the longer that you've had a card open for,
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.080]   the higher that your credit score will go up
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.000]   in the portion that looks at that section.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.800]   If it's no annual fee and it's not causing you any bother,
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.720]   just keep it open.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.960]   Obviously, if it has an annual fee,
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.720]   you're gonna have to like make an assessment.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.280]   Wait a minute, I'm paying say 200 a year, 300 a year.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.600]   Am I using any of these benefits?
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.320]   Am I using any of these perks?
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.880]   If it was purely a sign up bonus play,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.760]   like I mentioned, just make sure that you're spending
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.240]   more than what the minimum requirement is
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.760]   before you cancel it.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.120]   And yeah, cancel it towards the very end
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.560]   because they may offer you,
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560]   like the story that you shared with me,
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.520]   they may offer you a statement credit
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.600]   on the entire annual fee when you phone up.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.440]   You just never know.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.840]   Like I got that 50,000 points from Amex Platinum
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.240]   and there's been a few other scenarios as well.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.280]   But there's no reason to close it.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.880]   And it's actually a bit risky to close it,
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.400]   say in month five or month six.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.160]   Wait until the annual fee is gonna kick in,
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.480]   give them a call and yeah, just see what they offer you.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.160]   Like they could offer you something really awesome
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.120]   and you're like, oh, actually I did wanna close this,
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.560]   but now they've offered me 40,000 points.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.960]   Yeah, I don't wanna close it anymore.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.400]   - Yeah, when the Chase Reserve came out
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.640]   and it was three X on dining and travel,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.640]   I had the preferred, which was two X on dining and travel.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.320]   And I thought, I'm never gonna use this card again.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.400]   But one thing that you can also do
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.440]   is you can downgrade cards.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.040]   Now, I don't think every credit card company
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:19.880]   lets you do this.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.800]   I know Chase does, but I called up and said,
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.160]   oh, is there any free card you have
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.360]   that I can downgrade this to?
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.920]   Because I didn't wanna lose the history on that card.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.080]   And I did the same thing.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.280]   I had a United card for,
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.200]   that was the first card I got in college.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.580]   And it was really helping my credit
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.040]   in terms of how long of a history I had.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.600]   And it turns out, even though they don't really market it
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.720]   that heavily on the website,
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.440]   there is a no annual fee United card that I downgraded to.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.480]   So if you can't get them to waive the annual fee
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.960]   or give you a bonus,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.120]   you might be able to downgrade it to a free card
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.500]   and put it in a drawer.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.200]   But I would say, if you've had it for a long time
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.840]   and it's really helping your credit,
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.840]   it's worth at least once a year, go make a purchase.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.360]   Just make sure you spend something
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.480]   because unfortunately that United card got shut down
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.760]   and my average length of credit history dropped
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.600]   because that was the only card I'd had
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.960]   for more than 10 years.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.240]   - Yeah, I downgraded, actually thinking about it,
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.040]   I downgraded the Sapphire Preferred to a freedom card
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:18.880]   or something.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.800]   So yeah, like it keeps all that great history
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.600]   and doesn't hurt anything and it's a no annual fee card.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.140]   And you can set up a reminder or something
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.840]   to make a purchase or you can,
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.560]   sometimes people have a tiny recurring annual fee
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.660]   for a specific service.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.200]   Just stick it on that card, you know?
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.840]   So there's at least one transaction a year.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.940]   - Oh, I like that strategy.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.780]   - Yeah.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.240]   - Alex, this was amazing.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.560]   I feel like I thought I knew a lot about credit cards
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.280]   and points and I feel like I know even more now.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.080]   Hopefully everyone has a new strategy
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.520]   to take an amazing vacation.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.540]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.720]   Where can people find you, Upgraded Points
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.180]   and anything else you're excited about online?
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.020]   - Yeah, thanks Chris.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.760]   I really enjoyed the chat and Upgraded Points is my website
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.800]   and we got over 2000 articles there.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.240]   We go super detailed, lots of in-depth content
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.440]   and we update it regularly.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.200]   So go check out UpgradedPoints.com
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.920]   for more information about what we chatted about today
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.120]   and plenty of other topics as well.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.120]   - Wow, that was great.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.500]   There'll be lots of links in the show notes for sure.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.200]   So you can find those at allthehacks.com.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.340]   And thank you so much for listening.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.680]   I can't believe it's already been three shows.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.040]   I'm already working on lining up the next few episodes,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.000]   but in the meantime, I would love to know
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.600]   if there are any other topics you wanna hear about
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.000]   on the show or questions you have for me
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.080]   or even hacks that you know about that you want me to share.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.000]   You can email any of those to chris@allthehacks.com.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.360]   I really wanna make this show great for all of you.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.480]   So please reach out by email, on Twitter,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.000]   if you have any feedback or other ideas.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.600]   And to everyone who's already left a review or a rating,
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.280]   thank you so much.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   If you haven't, it's never too late
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.120]   and it would really help the show out.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.520]   It's one of the main ways that Apple decides what to feature
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.920]   or if you wanna share the show with a friend,
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.280]   that'd be amazing too.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.560]   So thank you so much
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.560]   and I'm really excited to keep this going.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.840]   Have a great day.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.480]   you
