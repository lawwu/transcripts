[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.520]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.160]   your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and today I want to talk about one of my favorite
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520]   hacks of all time, credit card points.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.520]   Thanks to this hack, I've been taking at least one free vacation every year for
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.160]   the last 10, 15, maybe even 20 years.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.880]   And these aren't small trips.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   Like we're talking two-week trips around the world, luxury hotels, flying
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.960]   first class, loving every minute of it, all for free.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.200]   And if I added up the cost of all these trips, I probably saved hundreds of
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   thousands of dollars.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.800]   In fact, I'm such a credit card optimizer that I thought about doing this whole
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   episode just by myself.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.960]   And then I met Alex.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Not only is Alex just as obsessed with credit cards and travel as I am, and
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.360]   helping make sure everyone he knows takes amazing trips and earns as much as they
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.960]   can, but he turned that passion into a site called Upgraded Points that he runs,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.640]   where you can learn about the best cards, the best tricks to earn the most points,
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.080]   travel hacks, reviews of hotels, and more.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.400]   So I thought it'd be even more fun and valuable to everyone listening if we do
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.560]   this show together, and not to mention his accent makes everything we do sound
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.880]   better.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.120]   So let's get into it.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.640]   But first, a message from a guy I hired online to read this disclosure.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.960]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.080]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.160]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.120]   investment decisions.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   Alex, thanks for being here.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.720]   Thanks so much, Chris, for inviting me.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.080]   I'm super excited to chat with you.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.920]   Yeah, so credit card points are near and dear to my heart.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.080]   I'm really excited for this episode.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.880]   And I thought it'd be good to go back to early stuff.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.320]   So for me, it turns out this started before I even remember it.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.080]   The picture I have of childhood, everyone has that photo that their parents are
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.520]   like, "This is my child."
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.600]   Mine was a picture of me sipping a bottle of apple juice with a pair of
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.160]   headphones on in a British Airways first class seat on the way to London when I
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.200]   was 11 months old.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.600]   And that's been my ethos before I even knew it was my ethos.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.560]   And it turns out my parents schlepped me around the world on various trips they
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.520]   took with points.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   And so this started early for me before I even got into it.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.680]   Ultimately, in college, I was like, "I can get credit cards and earn points."
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   I took my first trip and it all spiraled from there.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.760]   But I'd love to know, how did you get into this game?
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.160]   Yeah, so I have a very clear memory of this.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.960]   10 years ago or so, end of 2011, I moved completely over to America from the UK.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.080]   And so obviously I had to get on a flight to do that.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.400]   And I was traveling from London into Chicago.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.920]   And my life was like three big suitcases and that was it.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.880]   And I booked this economy ticket.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   I knew nothing about points.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.040]   Like the UK, there's three frequent flyer miles that are being split between the
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.720]   entire country.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.320]   There's no bonus points.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.600]   There's very little incentive for people to get excited about it.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.160]   So I knew nothing, got to the airport, I was booked for economy.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.280]   And basically I turned up looking scruffy.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.480]   I used to always wear like a Superman t-shirt.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.360]   It wasn't great looking back.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.240]   But I rocked up to check in my bags and the lady who was serving me took my
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.840]   details.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.680]   And then she looked at me, she wasn't very impressed.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.400]   And once she had put all my details into the machine, she basically looked at me
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.760]   and said, "Okay, it seems that you've been upgraded to business class."
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.280]   And she said it with a snarl.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.640]   She wasn't happy about it.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.600]   And I was thinking, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   How did that happen?
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.160]   So no one ever told me in the end.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   Luckily what I had done, and this is the only logical explanation for it.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.600]   I had, you know, signed up to the British Airways executive account membership and
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.760]   attached my number to the ticket.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.880]   That was the only thing I did.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.800]   I had no status.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.640]   I had nothing.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.320]   And they upgraded me and she was so annoyed about it.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.560]   And then she was like, "Oh, but wait, I see you've got some big bags there.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.120]   It's going to cost you 40 pounds to check."
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.720]   I was like, just take my wallet like immediately.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.840]   This is not an issue.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.040]   And inside I was like rejoicing, got onto that flight and I got a taste of business
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.320]   class.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.440]   And so that was a double upgrade, by the way, like skip premium economy.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.560]   They were like, boom, like you're in business.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.040]   And the flight was super busy.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.080]   So I think what happened was that because I happened to have the loyalty count, even
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.800]   though there was no status, they decided to upgrade me.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.320]   So there's probably a lot of people on that flight who just didn't have a loyalty
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.400]   program attached to their booking.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.200]   So there's a lesson there, which we can talk about later.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   But anyway, that's how I sort of got a taste of business class.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   I was like, oh my God, I don't want to do like economy again.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.720]   So really, when I got into America, starting up businesses and like points was just
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.600]   promoted on billboards like everywhere.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.240]   Everyone's talking about them.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   Credit cards are absolutely everywhere with these bonus promotions and things like
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.440]   that.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.360]   And I was so intrigued, so spending money, my business, obviously spending money to
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.960]   live and everything.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.280]   And I was like, I'm an optimizer.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.960]   So I was like, I've got to dive into this world.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.480]   So I followed a couple of blogs, realized that this is actually something I could be
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.920]   doing.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.280]   And then I was completely addicted.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   So basically for the last 10 years, I've been researching it pretty much every day.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.160]   And then obviously now I run this site that I've had for like five years that launched
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   in 2016.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.760]   I'm fully immersed in it.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.480]   And a couple of years after coming to America, I took the first amazing sort of
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   like redemption, like first class and business class and all this sort of stuff.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.800]   And yeah, that's what like fed the addiction was that like free upgrade combined with
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.400]   the fact that like in America, like people just talk about this stuff like all the
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.720]   time.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.320]   It's so I don't know if you spend a lot of time in the UK and everything, but people
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.360]   just don't talk about that stuff like it's not promoted.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.840]   It sounds like there aren't a lot of options to earn points there like there are
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.120]   here.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.440]   Exactly.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.320]   The competition is nowhere near as fierce as over here.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.520]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.680]   Here, when you accept a credit card, you're paying like 3% almost fees to to the
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.360]   processor.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   And that money makes its way back to the credit card company in some format.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.320]   And then they say, we want to get more people spending money.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.560]   So we'll give people points.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.520]   And it's this cycle.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.000]   And I always tell people, if you're not paying with your credit card, you're leaving
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.840]   money on the table.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.320]   And I think of it as a way to just get more money from banks, airlines, these are
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   hated industries.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.400]   No, totally.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   And it pains me as well.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.080]   I see someone using a debit card.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.200]   I'm just like, okay, given the benefit of the doubt, maybe they feel like they
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.520]   wouldn't be able to pay off their credit card if they had one.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.920]   And the temptation is too much.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.320]   But I think I'm too kind.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.640]   I think there's too many people there who just have not delved into that world a
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   little bit and realize that debit cards, they offer such little value.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.520]   And the credit cards really, I mean, the rewards and the bonuses and the perks that
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.240]   you can leverage for them are absolutely incredible.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.080]   And the only thing you have to do is make sure that you pay off your statement every
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.120]   single month. If you do that, then all of those benefits are so worth it.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.920]   Yeah, all the benefits of everything we'll discuss today never come close to being
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   better than paying off your debt.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.600]   So if you have credit card debt, focus on getting that down to the point that you can
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.440]   pay off your bill each month before you get into the credit card game.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.320]   Okay, so using a debit card is an obvious red flag that you're not optimizing your
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.480]   cards and points. What else?
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.160]   Actually, another red flag is when someone is like using, I don't know, like an
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.760]   American Airlines card at a supermarket or when they're going out and having something
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.800]   to eat or buying some drinks or something, because a lot of the airline cards reward
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.840]   you really poorly for those transactions.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.200]   Whereas the flexible points, like you can get three, four, five points per dollar spent
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.040]   at supermarkets or filling up gas or dining out and stuff.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   So you've got to look at where you're spending your money.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.360]   The majority of it, I take things to extremes.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.960]   I've got like 19 credit cards.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.040]   I've got a bit mental with it.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.240]   More than me.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   I actually consolidated.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.000]   I was like, OK, once you go over 20, like that is legitimately mental.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.720]   So I got rid of four recently, but I staggered it over to not hurt my credit too much.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.920]   But yeah, you want to look at where you're spending your money.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.360]   So if you like going out and you like dining and spend money at bars or whatever, then
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.960]   you should really get a card that gives you like what we call like a multiplier bonus
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.240]   for those transactions.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.520]   So how would someone even figure out where they're spending money to figure out what
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.800]   kind of credit cards might make sense?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.680]   Is there something you do to evaluate your spending?
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.400]   You can use like a simple sort of like budget tracker like Mint.com where you can
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.360]   connect all your cards to that account and then it automatically figures out where
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.960]   you're spending your money. So you can just have a quick glance at that at the end of
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.440]   month and be like, huh, wow, I actually spend like 35% of my money at restaurants.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.400]   So I should probably make sure that I'm getting a card that gives me the general rule
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080]   of thumb is I'm pretty annoyed.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.040]   I'm very annoyed if I'm only getting one point per dollar spent.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.920]   For me, it's got to be like a minimum of one and a half or two.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.280]   And so, yeah, Mint basically is like a good option for that.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.840]   What do you use?
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.840]   So I used to use Mint and there's a bunch of cool budgeting apps out there that are
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.880]   like Mint. I just was playing around last night in advance of this conversation and I
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   saw that both Chase and Amex have a spending report and they used to do these as
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   like a PDF at the end of the year only for the last year.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.840]   And now both of them have a look at the last few months, look at last year and they'll
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.240]   just break it down by category.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.960]   So it's a little more work.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.200]   And that if you have two credit cards or one of them is at a bank that doesn't offer
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.760]   this, you might have to look across all of them in multiple places.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.920]   And in that case, it might be way easier to just sync everything to Mint and then go
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   look through all those transactions and see where they are.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.320]   But I will say Mint sometimes gets the category wrong.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.360]   And I think the credit card companies get the category right a lot more.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.240]   So if your credit card company today offers one of these spending reports, I feel like
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.600]   it's the most accurate data.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.480]   But if you have credit cards at lots of places or they don't, Mint, I think, is still
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.040]   a great place to link an account and look at all of the all the different budgeting
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.360]   things. But don't look at Mint's credit card recommendations, because not only are
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.680]   they incentivized by whoever is paying them the most, but I swear every time I've
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.120]   logged into Mint, they say, "You need an Amex Platinum." And I'm like, "I have my and
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.280]   my wife's Amex Platinum linked to Mint." Like, I don't need a third Amex.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.320]   I can't even get a third Amex Platinum.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.560]   So ignore the recommendation.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.440]   Me and my wife both have a Platinum, like two Platinums each.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   Like, I don't think we need any more.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.760]   Yeah. And you did mention credit earlier.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   Let's talk a little bit about credit.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.000]   Yeah. So when I came here from the UK, I had no credit at all.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.640]   The bank that I still had in the UK, they were like, "Sorry, we can't transfer you
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.840]   credit to the US." So you're basically like a 17-year-old in a hoodie with some
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.920]   shades on, walking around, looking shifty.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.600]   Well, it sounds like you actually were dressed like that, even though you might
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.440]   not have been 17.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.840]   Yeah, just slight modification.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.360]   I had a Superman T-shirt on, and that was it.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.320]   Yeah. I was actually very lucky, but this could be an option for many people.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.400]   My wife is American, and her parents very generously...
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.840]   I needed a car when I got to America.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.680]   I was like, "Oh, my God." And I need a truck as well.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.600]   Like, something that's way too big, but it's really cool.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.920]   And so I was like, "OK, I need a truck.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.520]   I haven't got any credit.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.920]   What do I do?" And her parents co-signed for me, which is amazing because it was
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.280]   their credit, basically, that I piggybacked off.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.560]   And so what I did was I purposely paid it off over like 12 to 15 months to show the
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.480]   banks that I could pay on time and that I could do this regularly.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.640]   It wasn't just for one month, but it was 15 months.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.840]   And my credit rating literally just skyrocketed into the 700s.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.880]   It was so fast.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.760]   Something that people always ask me, like, "Oh, isn't opening a bunch of credit
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.880]   cards going to hurt your credit?"
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:48.360]   It turns out that almost 65-70% of your credit is your payment history.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.080]   So one, make your payments on time.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.800]   And if you didn't make a payment on time in the past, you can even go back and
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.680]   dispute it and maybe get that overturned.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.600]   And then it's actually your kind of debt to credit ratio.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.720]   So when you have a new card, banks don't like lending money to people that are
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.160]   using all of their credit.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.880]   So if you have three cards, you actually have a whole lot more credit.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.840]   As long as you don't increase your spending 3x, it can actually help your
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.560]   credit. Now, I know part of the credit score is inquiries against credit.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.800]   So when you open a card, you will lose five or so points each time.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.200]   But having more credit, paying on time, having a long history really adds to it.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.880]   So it can hurt your credit a little bit.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.520]   But the long term benefit, and especially if you don't have a lot of cards, opening
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.760]   a new card can actually bring it up.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.800]   Yeah, and like you said, you might get dinged five points or something when you
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.280]   open a new card, but that is super short term, like in a couple of months it will
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   restore back. As I said earlier, I got 19 or 20 credit cards and credit score is
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:57.560]   not crazily high because I don't have a mortgage yet, but it's 770, 765 because
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.600]   my credit utilization is something like $200,000.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.560]   So like my available credit that I could use, but clearly I'm not spending anywhere
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.040]   near that per month.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.480]   If you're the type of person listening here where having $200,000 of credit means
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.360]   you'll spend it, this is not a good episode for you.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.320]   Yeah, I agree with that one.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.520]   It's a shame when you came over to the U.S.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.760]   at the beginning, there was there's a company now, a guy I know actually started
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.960]   this company called Nova Credit, and they partnered with Amex and a few other credit
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.320]   card issuers, and they actually will use data from overseas agencies, convert it to
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.120]   a format that the banks here understand.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.360]   And so if you go to Nova, you can say, I'm from the U.K., here's all my U.K.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.800]   information. And Nova will bridge the gap so that you can open up a card in the U.S.,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.480]   even though you have no credit history.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.640]   I know that didn't exist when you came over, but if anyone here is new to the U.S.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.120]   right now listening, Nova Credit is a great company that lets you leverage your
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.000]   overseas credit to open cards up here.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.120]   That's really cool. And it'll make your life a lot easier.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   The other option, just real quick, is that secured credit cards are really good.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.720]   So I was helping out a business friend the other day who was like, English guy, my
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.960]   credit sucks. And I was like, well, you could just get a secured credit card, which
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.800]   basically means that you put down this deposit that you give to the bank.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.040]   So if things go bad, they know that they can take your 200 and pay off whatever you
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.640]   charge to the card. But if you basically just use that, even that small credit limit,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.280]   200 is not super useful. But if you put $50 on, like pay it off, put $100 on, pay it
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.080]   off. If you do that for under a year, like that will really increase your credit score
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.360]   as well.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.800]   Yeah, it's effectively a debit card in that you can only spend the money you've put
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.000]   on deposit with the bank, but it builds your credit in a way that a debit card
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.320]   doesn't.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.520]   Yeah, because debit cards never help with credit.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.600]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.280]   emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.240]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:04.880]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1, 37,000.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.760]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.880]   25.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.000]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.

[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.200]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.120]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.280]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place, and
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.920]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.560]   to use.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.520]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.680]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.760]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.

[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.960]   having to give up any personal or banking details.

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.080]   So before we jump into points cards, which I think offer tremendous value, I
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.040]   meet a lot of people who they think they're playing the rewards game because
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   they have a card that earns them 1% or 2% cash back or 1.5% cash back.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.360]   I know points can, you know, flexible points, transferable points, they can earn
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.320]   a lot more than that.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.080]   But is there a type of person where earning 1.5%, 2% cash back is actually the
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.560]   right path forward for them?
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   Yeah, I think it's good for people who just want things to be ridiculously simple.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.280]   Like, there's no way of turning cash back into something complex.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.960]   You get the cash back, you can use it for either travel or non-travel.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.080]   But if, and especially I think cash back is useful for those who, and maybe not too
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.040]   many of those who will listen to this podcast, who don't actually want to earn
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.360]   points for travel or don't want to travel that much.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.240]   But yeah, it's really just simplicity, like, you know, the Citi double cash card,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.920]   like 2% on any purchase, no limitations.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.880]   It's super duper simple.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.520]   And it's just not the way you're going to earn the most points, right?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.120]   Like, no, you can't, like, you can't get, you know, outsized value with cash back.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.080]   Like it's, it's not a great tool for me and for many optimizers and in this kind
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.640]   of space, it's, yeah, it's not going to get you too far.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.320]   I think points have had a reputation in the past of the only way you can use a
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.840]   point is if you fly on this one day in this one way, but even most of the points
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.960]   cards these days offer some way to use your points towards reimbursing yourself
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.800]   or booking through a travel portal.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.840]   So you end up getting some of the benefit of cash back in that you could just buy a
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   ticket and reimburse yourself, or you can buy it without waiting for award space to
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.600]   open up, but you also get the huge bonuses when you're spending on these points
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.560]   cards, which there's no cashback card I'm aware of.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.280]   That's giving you five X back on your dollars.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.160]   Exactly.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.040]   So like I was going to say, if you had to add to your point, like if you had the
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.600]   Amex gold, for example, and you can earn four times points, supermarket purchases,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.640]   then if you wanted to use those points in the portal and you get one cent per point,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.360]   you're basically earning 4% cash back.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.000]   So, yeah, so even the points cards can be better cash back cards than the cash back
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.800]   cards, as long as you're spending money in one of these categories, which are the
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.160]   biggest bonuses are in travel and dining and groceries and shop gas are big ones.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.880]   But yeah, I always tell people my favorite cash back card is my points card.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.920]   Now I just don't happen to use it like that, but one thing are all miles and points
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.440]   the same, I tend to think they're not.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.160]   And I'm curious if you have an attitude towards certain miles being more valuable
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.960]   to accumulate or points to accumulate than others.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.280]   So for me, flexible points and transferable points are by far the most valuable
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:23.000]   because you're able to not only use those for buying flights or hotel stays through
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.760]   through portals, through travel portals, but also this is the biggest takeaway.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.360]   Like you can transfer those to their airline partners or hotel partners.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.240]   So Chase have 10 plus airline and hotel partners.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.840]   Amex have considerably more.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.600]   Citi have their own bunch and so do Capital One.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.680]   So if you guys have any points that are sitting with Chase, Amex, Citi or Capital
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.160]   One now, you can literally transfer them to a bunch of different airlines and hotels
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.800]   and get incredible value that way.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.400]   Most people are spending them in the portal or redeeming them terribly for gift cards.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.600]   So gift cards aren't a good use of points.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.280]   Terrible is literally the worst thing you could do because you're getting less than
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.600]   one cent per point in redemption value.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.480]   So my general rule of thumb is that you want to be getting about two cents in value
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.600]   per point. But the gift cards, like I think you get point seven of a cent.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.640]   So a friend told me last year, he was like, oh, you'll be proud of me, Alex.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.200]   I just redeemed a hundred thousand points for like Amazon gift cards.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.600]   I'm definitely not proud of you.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.880]   That was a terrible decision.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.560]   So, yeah, the most amount of value is definitely with like flexible points.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.720]   If you've got the less valuable ones are definitely with the airlines, because you
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.560]   can't transfer, like so many people think you can just transfer American Airlines to
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.800]   like some other airline.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   I'm like, no, you can't.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.760]   If I have United Miles, I can book on their partners.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.720]   But if I have Chase Points, not only can I transfer them to United and book on their
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.880]   partners, but I can also transfer them to six or seven other airlines or hotel chains.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.840]   And yeah, I'm with you.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.560]   I always think I'd much rather have a Chase Point than a United Point because a Chase
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.320]   Point can be transferred to be a United Point.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.200]   You get all the benefits of a United Point with a Chase Point plus more.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.480]   And the cool thing is, so this is a common one.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.920]   Most people who fly Southwest love Southwest.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.360]   It's just like this lovable brand.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.120]   And most people who fly them commonly will have a Southwest credit card and be like,
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.000]   OK, yeah, got the bonus using the card like life is great.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.040]   And I'm like, do you want more Southwest points because you like to fly with them?
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.240]   Yeah, obviously I do. Why don't you sign up to like a Chase credit card?
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.960]   You could use a Chase Alpha Reserve card, for example, for getting three X on dining
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.560]   expenses or travel expenses.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.720]   The Southwest, even if you book with Southwest, they only give you two points per
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.920]   dollar spent. So you can immediately add 50 percent more points by booking with the
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Chase Alpha Reserve.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   If you got a platinum, then you could get five X by using that card to book your
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.280]   Southwest flight. So you're just like accumulating tons and tons of points through
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.840]   little adjustments like that.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.760]   If you love an airline, don't think that having that airline credit card is all that
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:14.280]   you can do. It's very common that you can collect transferable points and then
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.040]   transfer those directly into your airline account and top up your balances that way.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.960]   So, I mean, that's a real big one and something I've done for years.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.040]   Yeah, I often tell people, look, if you're really loyal to an airline or a hotel and
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.440]   the card gives you tangible benefits for that, whether it gives you access to the
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.800]   airline lounge or it gets you free upgrades or free checked bags, those are things
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.160]   that you often won't get with the Chase Ultimate Rewards card or the Amex card.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.000]   But if you want to earn the most points booking flights, it's almost always with a
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.840]   card that isn't the airline's card.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.080]   There's very few occasions where you want to use your airline card to pay for a
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   flight. Like you just said, you may get additional perks like lounge access or like
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.080]   priority boarding and stuff.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.840]   And that's cool. That makes sense for people who regularly fly with an airline.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.680]   But that card is not your strategy for accumulating the most valuable points.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.640]   It's going to be in almost all scenarios.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.560]   It's going to be collecting these or earning these transferable points instead.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.280]   That's how you can accumulate so many of these points.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.840]   And hotel cards, I think, are depending on the chain.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.760]   Like I know with my Marriott card, I actually earn more points when I'm staying at a
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.680]   Marriott than I would if I used any other card and transferred back.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.080]   So I think that's one of a, you know, look into it.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.200]   But for airline cards, it's pretty bad.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.160]   Like hotel cards, you get that like free annual stay, like one night.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.160]   So if you got one of the Marriott cards, they'll allow you to redeem for one night at
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.760]   any hotel in whatever category it might be, category one to four or something.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.880]   And that can have quite a lot of value.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.160]   You know, that's often valued at double of whatever the annual fee is for most of the
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.600]   cards. You brought up a really good point there, which is a lot of people look at cards
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.760]   with annual fees and they think, gosh, this card's really expensive.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.560]   And one thing in the example you just gave, you might have a Marriott card that has a
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.600]   ninety five dollar annual fee and you might say, oh, I'm not staying at enough Marriott
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.160]   that the spending makes sense.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.840]   But every year they might give you a free night that's worth two or three hundred
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.880]   dollars. And I often say, don't look at the annual fee, look at the annual fee minus
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.160]   whatever benefits you get.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.760]   And so cards like the Chase Reserve card, it's an expensive annual fee, but they'll
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.640]   knock off the first three hundred dollars of travel spend.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.080]   So you can't really look at it as the whole fee.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.960]   You kind of have to look at it net of all of these things that come with it.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.040]   Yeah, yeah. And that's what puts people off getting those like more, quote unquote,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   like luxury cards.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.280]   People think, well, you know, like only rich people have an Amex Platinum like that card
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.320]   isn't for me. And with a five hundred and fifty dollar annual fee, like, I mean, that
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.680]   is a lot. But it's it shouldn't be seen as this like sunk cost that you can never get
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.400]   back. First off, like the sign up bonuses for most of them would pay for the annual
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.440]   fee for several years, the value from that.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.640]   And then like the Platinum, for example, comes loaded with benefits.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.280]   And these cards make a lot of sense to a lot of people.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.760]   I mean, at the moment, because of obviously like pandemic and everything, they're giving
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.320]   you credits, things like Uber Eats and you get elite status of Hilton and Marriott, like
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.600]   Gold Elite. That's pretty cool.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   If you stay at any of those hotels like Wrigley, then just instantly get Gold Elite like
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.360]   by signing up like that has a lot of value.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.400]   And then, yeah, like some of those cards can give you, like I said, like the Platinum,
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.200]   they can get 5x on booking flights.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   If you book flights regularly, you're going to get a whole ton of points from that.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   And that's extra value.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   So try not to like, yes, the annual fee is a real thing.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.960]   You have to pay it. But that card makes a lot of sense for people who can utilize those
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:58.720]   benefits. And we easily get four times the amount of value back per year by using like
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.760]   the Platinum card like effortlessly.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.520]   So, yeah, like annual fees, like quite rightly put people off.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.120]   But you've got to look at the benefits and the perks and see if that makes sense for
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.360]   you, because often you can just get so much more value back from them.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.200]   And I'll just say one quick thing.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   If you said the annual fee, you have to pay it.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.800]   But if you've had a card for a few years and you found that right now you're not getting a
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.520]   lot of value out of it and you're thinking of cancelling it before you do, it's always
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   worth calling the credit card company and just saying, hey, look, I didn't get a lot of
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.320]   value out of this. I'm thinking of cancelling unless there's something you could do.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.400]   And I've had annual fees refunded.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.120]   I've said, oh, go spend a thousand dollars in the next month and we'll give you twenty
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.560]   thousand points. And I'm not a fan of calling every year to threaten, but if I'm
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.760]   actually thinking of cancelling something and there's an offer that's worth keeping it,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.840]   I'm definitely all ears.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.080]   Yeah, totally. Like my strategy is very similar.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:55.280]   Basically, within about one or two weeks of the annual fee kicking in, give them a call.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.680]   It helps you actually use the card.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.480]   If it's five thousand dollars you've got to spend to get the sign up bonus, don't spend
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.960]   five thousand and one and then call them up and expect them to give you free statement
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.600]   credits and everything. You want to use your card fairly regularly.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.480]   But I'll phone up and I'll say I'm not a hard baller either.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.360]   I'm terrible at that. So I'll be like, you know what?
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.920]   I love this card. Once I had to phone up Amex because I needed some help.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.520]   The customer service agent was like amazing and it was great.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.200]   And yeah, I do use it.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.280]   But you know what?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.560]   I spend money in this certain category and this card doesn't really give me too much
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.640]   value back. What can you do to sort of help me renew this?
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.920]   And if you just have a nice conversation and I find if you're not hard balling them.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:41.280]   Yeah, I got like the first time I phoned up after getting the platinum, I phoned up and
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.000]   used the strategy. I got fifty thousand points for staying on.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.560]   And I was like, yes, that was better than me.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.800]   I just got my five hundred and fifty dollar annual fee refunded.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.240]   Well, I would have taken I would have taken fifty thousand points, which actually is a
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   perfect segue.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.720]   So before we jump into just the best credit cards, I'm curious if we could give people
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.240]   some examples of how valuable points can actually be.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.800]   When we talked about cash back, sure, you can get one two percent cash back if you're
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.880]   accumulating points.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.160]   I think it's possible you mentioned that platinum card can give you five points on
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.480]   travel. The reserve can give you three on dining.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.560]   But the real magic, I think, comes from spending those points by transferring them to
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.680]   airlines or hotels and taking really epic adventures.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.840]   And I think it's cool to really make it clear how valuable that can be.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.160]   So I'll give one example and I want to hear what yours are.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.640]   And maybe we'll just share a few to give people an idea of how cool this can be.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.120]   Mine is my honeymoon.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.600]   We wanted to go to the Seychelles, which we'd never even heard of.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.880]   But we were like, let's take the most exotic, crazy trip we can.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.320]   And it's an island off the eastern coast of Africa.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.360]   And we booked it on Air France in business class.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.560]   The flights were about eleven or twelve thousand dollars roundtrip if we wanted to pay
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.320]   for them. And there were one hundred twenty thousand points for us just buying them with
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.720]   dollars, which that's gone up a little bit since then.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.600]   But that's almost ten cents per point.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.120]   So if you look at a card that's earning four points per dollar, if you can earn ten
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.760]   cents for each of those points, you're effectively getting 40 percent cash back.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.840]   And we took it one step further.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.600]   We knew that this was such a good deal and we wanted a wedding videographer and our
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.560]   wedding videographer we couldn't afford.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.520]   And so she had told me in passing that she also wanted to go to the Seychelles and we
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.800]   didn't go on a trip with her.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.040]   But we said, what if you do the wedding videography for free and we'll send you and
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.600]   your husband to the Seychelles as well on a future trip?
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.760]   And so we ended up spending at that time, it was like four hundred and eighty thousand
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.400]   Amex points. But we got about forty eight thousand dollars of value, which for me was
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.960]   like the best redemption of all time.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.520]   What about you? Yeah, and you said ten cents per point of value.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.000]   Remember, the portal gives you a whopping one gift card.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.200]   Don't buy gift cards.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.280]   Don't buy gift cards.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.400]   Gift cards is even worse.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.080]   So, yeah, I've been very fortunate.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.560]   Like I've done a ton of business and first class travel.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   Certainly a memorable one is a round the world trip that I did with my wife.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.280]   My oldest brother actually lives in Vietnam.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.440]   So we went to go see him and then went to go see some friends in Sydney, Australia, and
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.720]   then also combine that with going to the Middle East.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   And basically we for three hundred and ten thousand miles per person, we paid just over
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.240]   a grand in taxes and fees.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.200]   We got to fly Singapore suites first class.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.400]   By the way, for anyone listening, Singapore suites first class is not a bigger seat,
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.200]   right? This is a bed.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.880]   Yeah, a chair.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.640]   Yeah, a double bed.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.280]   You could put these together and you have a double bed on an airplane.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.200]   So for anyone who hasn't had the chance to see these kind of really ridiculous
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.760]   international first class, this is nothing like the first four seats you walk by when
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.160]   you get on a domestic flight.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.280]   This is a whole nother level.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.960]   So, yeah, Singapore suites was absolutely incredible.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:14.520]   We also got to fly Etihad's apartment, which like words can't even describe how
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.800]   ridiculous that cabin is.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.760]   And they got showers and everything.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.680]   And is that the one with the door?
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   And then you have a little living area and then you have your own bathroom and your own
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.520]   bedroom. Yeah.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.320]   So like, well, that's the residence where you got the bedroom as well.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.800]   Oh, OK. It's everything you just said, like minus the minus the bedroom.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.720]   Like it's so ridiculous.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.520]   And actually for that specific flight, it ended up being one hundred thousand points
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.400]   and five hundred dollars in cash.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.800]   Like who would not pay five hundred dollars to like fly 14 hours?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.040]   We would just like this can't be happening.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.080]   This is so ridiculous.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.040]   And not only, by the way, on these flights, are you getting these amazing like you have
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.160]   a chair, you have a bed.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.560]   They're usually pouring you like Dom Perignon, like you're getting like more value
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.920]   than just that. And in some of these airlines, they will pick you up at home.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.400]   In a town car or a limo and bring you to the airport, you'll get the lounges at the
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.760]   airport. Some of the lounges I've been in have massages.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.000]   So like some of these real premium international first class trips are way more than
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.520]   the mind can sometimes imagine.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.800]   And for all those miles, so it's three hundred thousand each.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.640]   But so not quite done yet.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.160]   So we did the Singapore suites.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   We did the Etihad apartment.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.960]   And then on my birthday from Dubai back over to we flew back into LAX.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.400]   It was my thirty third birthday and we flew Emirates first.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.920]   And that is the most blingy over the top experience.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.880]   The cabin crew are just incredible.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.920]   You can go up to the bar and start ordering Dom Perignon champagne cocktails, which is
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   completely unnecessary.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.080]   If you can do it, why not?
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   And by bar, like this is a bar on the plane.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.200]   The bar on the plane.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.280]   Yeah, it's like the back and business class and first class can go there.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:04.160]   But if your first class are like, oh, make sure he gets the Dom Perignon, it's just so
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.720]   over the top. And they have showers, too, with heated floors.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.120]   And it's just way too much space.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.720]   The size of the bathroom is probably the equivalent of like nine economy seats.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.600]   It's very, very luxurious and very amazing.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.120]   So the cost of all of that for two people, it would have cost us fifty five thousand
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.520]   dollars if we had paid in cash.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.560]   It ended up being two thousand dollars between us for all the taxes and fees.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.800]   And by the way, all of those flights and there was a few I didn't mention, like
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.560]   Singapore business, the economy price of them was over four thousand.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.600]   So we actually paid half of what it would have cost to have flown all of those in
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.960]   economy. So it just blows my mind.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.920]   And actually, a lot of those people might look at that and be like, that's just
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   that's pretty aggressive. What can I do with that bit of information?
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.640]   So you could take one of those flights.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.560]   OK, my goal is to fly Emirates first.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.680]   I want to go from, say, Houston or Boston over to Dubai.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.000]   Let's do it. You can totally.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.560]   That's so achievable that actually since we're talking about it, like that Emirates
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.840]   flight might cost about at the moment, it's about one hundred and thirty thousand
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.560]   points each way. So it's one of the more expensive ones.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.400]   But it's fifty six dollars in taxes and fees.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.000]   They've just reduced those massively.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   And you can transfer your points from Chase, for example, like over to Emirates or
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.720]   you or these are like ten thousand dollar flights.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.480]   Oh, these are not cheap flights with dollars.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   Yeah. Yeah. It's even if you could afford that, like me and my wife play the city
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.120]   game when we're waiting to get on a flight.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.720]   We're like, it's called points or cash.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   It's a very simple game.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.160]   We literally look around and we're like, oh, that person looks like, you know,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.320]   wearing a suit and stuff, looks smart, clearly going to business class because
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.720]   he's lining up for business. What do you reckon?
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:53.080]   Points are cash. To me, it's so obvious when someone is using cash because I
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.280]   don't know. I feel like that person is just not like an optimizer.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.320]   And anyway, has there ever been a contentious episode of points or cash where
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.880]   both of you were so sure you were right, but you thought the opposite, that you
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   had to ask the person?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.000]   Yeah, we've definitely had a little bit of an argument about it, but I didn't have
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.680]   the guts to actually go and ask the person.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.480]   I was like, hey, yeah, I hope you enjoy your first class leaning over, trying to
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.920]   look at his ticket, see if you could glance at you.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.720]   Yeah, exactly. But yeah, like just you could book like that Emirates first.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.320]   If you find a what space where you could book it for 130,000, if you've got a big
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.920]   sign up bonus or you've been using a card that rewards you for the areas that you
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.880]   spend the most money in, like these are super attainable.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.360]   It's almost like they're so over the top, these products that you look at people in
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.480]   them in images or videos and you think categorically could not do that.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.040]   Like, you know, I run my site, Upgraded Points, and we get comments from people
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   saying you're just rich.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.360]   That doesn't work.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.720]   I'm like, oh, could you just check out this article where we do literally like a
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.680]   step by step? This is how you book Etihad or Emirates or Singapore or something.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.520]   And then you come back and they're like, oh, amazing.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.000]   Like I didn't actually realize this was attainable or the conversation goes very
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.160]   quiet. Yeah.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.920]   I always say once you get a taste of business class, it's like, God, business or
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.040]   first is the only way I want to cross an ocean.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.000]   But if you don't play the points game, that can be pretty expensive.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   If anyone's listening doesn't have a good sense that you can go on amazing vacations
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.240]   for free, then, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.080]   So is there any trip you like really want to take with your points?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.160]   Yeah, funny you ask that, Ashley, because I'm in the middle of trying to find some
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:33.000]   award space to get on to A&A's first class products and then fly back in business
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   because I want to experience both.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   They have a new product for business and first and there is an amazing this is
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.520]   probably like the best redemption option out there at the moment.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.560]   So even though this doesn't make any sense and it's feasible because of the
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.600]   partnerships that airlines have with each other, you can transfer from Chase
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:02.000]   one hundred and twenty thousand points to your Virgin Atlantic account and book A&A
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.680]   first class round trip.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.440]   So sixty thousand points each way to Japan from the US.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:15.200]   And literally, like if you go and Google like an A&A first class cash price, I
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.280]   don't think you'll ever find one that's under ten grand each way.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.360]   Like it's obscenely expensive.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.000]   And for one hundred and twenty thousand points, again, I don't fly in A&A, so I
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.280]   haven't earned those points by flying them or using their credit card.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.120]   I've transferred them from Chase, these transferable amazing points.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.960]   And that's what I'm looking at.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.560]   I've also got a Singapore first trip booked for like later this year.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.680]   I don't know whether I'll take it or not because of obviously the current
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.840]   environment. But I booked that a while ago.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.560]   So I'm super excited if that materializes.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.840]   So it's clear that there's incredible value from credit card points and using
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.440]   them to take amazing vacations.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   I feel like now's the time to ask, what are the best cards now?
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:05.680]   I've been so out of the loop for the last 18 months with a new child, a new
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.600]   job, the pandemic.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.800]   You run a site about this.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.320]   What are the best points cards right now?
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.400]   Yes, I really like the Amex Gold card.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.560]   I think they've done an amazing job with it over the years.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.360]   So the Amex Gold will get you four times points when you're spending money at
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.120]   supermarkets, but also restaurants.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.760]   And then you'll get three points per dollar spent flights and travel if you book
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.640]   through their portal.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.480]   You also get Uber Eats free pass and then $10 a month credit.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.160]   And the sign up bonus is pretty generous at the moment as well.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.920]   So the Amex Gold is like a great kind of every day because I feel like most people
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.400]   shop at grocery stores like somewhat regularly and go to restaurants and so forth
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   and obviously book travel.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.240]   So the Amex Gold I really like.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.560]   And again, remember, like Amex have a ton of airline and hotel transfer partners.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.960]   So you're earning points fast and then you've got so many different ways that you
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.760]   can use those.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.960]   I also like like on the Chase side, I do the Chase Apple Reserve.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.120]   You get three points per dollar spent on like dining and travel.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.760]   When people start like using Lyft and things like that, a lot more, you get 10
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   times points per dollar spent on Lyft travel, which is really cool.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.120]   And then, as you mentioned earlier, as part of the annual fee, you get $300 that you
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.600]   can use towards travel.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   But actually, at the moment, they've sweetened that deal.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.280]   You can use that towards grocery and like gas expenses.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:35.360]   So it's really easy to use up that $300, which is eroding that annual fee.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.400]   So those are some really good cards.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.600]   If you want to step it up.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.080]   Oh, by the way, the Sapphire Reserve is great for lounge access.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.880]   You get into those, you've probably heard of like priority pass lounges.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.840]   There's 1,200, 1,300 of them around the world.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.600]   So that's great if you want to be relaxing in the lounge when you're at the
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.360]   airport. And then, to be honest, like one of my favorites for sure, and I can't not
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:01.000]   mention is the Amex Platinum, because it is the best card for lounge access, because
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.920]   not only do you get access to all the priority pass, you get into the amazing
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.080]   Centurion lounges, which I absolutely love.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.240]   They're just super crisp, run very well, really delicious food and unlimited drinks.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.280]   And even some of them have like spas and showers and so forth.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.680]   And they've got a bunch now.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.200]   I don't remember specifically how many, but it's at least a dozen and they keep
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.120]   popping up everywhere.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.200]   I'm waiting for one to come to Austin, but fingers crossed on that.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:30.120]   I have the Platinum and the only caveat I'll say is I view it with the exception of
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.720]   getting five points on flights, which is huge if you book a lot of flights, right?
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.520]   Other cards, you might earn three, five is definitely the most that I'm aware of.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.200]   But other than that, I think the Platinum card, I view it more as a perks card.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.720]   There's a lot of credits for things that you can buy right now.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.480]   Every month you get $30 off PayPal and you get $50 or off at Saks Fifth Avenue.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.760]   So there's just credits and perks and lounge access, but I don't actually, other
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.120]   than flights, put any money on my Platinum card.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:43:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.240]   It's not the card that you want to use to start accruing and earning loads of
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:04.680]   points.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.000]   Like you said, it's the benefits and the perks card, because remember too, with
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.960]   those benefits that you had mentioned, you get the hotel, like elite status, you
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.640]   get gold elite at Hilton and Marriott, pretty cool because those statuses give
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.840]   you upgrades and all the rest of it and earning more points when you stay there.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.160]   That's where the gold comes in because you're rewarded.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.720]   Like I use the gold to like accrue loads of points and then I'm like cashing in my
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.640]   benefits as it were, like using the Platinum.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.080]   So yeah, like those are a couple of the cards that are really hot right now.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.080]   So you mentioned the Amex Gold, you mentioned the Chase Reserve, our two great
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.720]   earning cards, the categories are a little overlap, right?
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.200]   So you've got restaurants on both, you've got travel on the Reserve, you've got
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.000]   groceries on the gold, you know, is there a card you think is a good complimentary
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.720]   card for all that other spending that doesn't fall into a category, whether it's
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:03.160]   a drugstore, whether it's, you know, Home Depot, whether it's shopping online, do
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.800]   you use those cards for those purchases or what do you do?
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.640]   So I'll have, so for example, I got the Chase Freedom Unlimited, which is
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.560]   like my cashback card, I'll use that card to get me at least one and
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.360]   a half cent cashback, but what's really cool is that if you had the Chase Sapphire
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.640]   Reserve or the Chase Sapphire Preferred or a number of Chase's business cards
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.760]   that carry an annual fee, if you've accrued cashback with the Freedom
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.280]   Unlimited, you can convert that cashback into points.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:42.360]   So for me, like I'm only using a cashback card if I can then later, if I need
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.880]   to convert that cashback into points.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.120]   And it's a little hack there because they never market this, the Unlimited
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.720]   is marketed as a cashback card.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.920]   And by having another Chase card that has an annual fee, you can convert it
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.800]   over and then like we've chatted about, you can use those points for incredible
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.280]   travel.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.920]   So I do like the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.320]   Some people like, if they truly want cashback, like they might use something
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.240]   like the Amex Blue Cash Preferred, which gives you like 6% cashback on
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.600]   supermarkets, that's pretty cool.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.640]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.920]   actually so good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.800]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.880]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.320]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.560]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.440]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.600]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.440]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:53.920]   friendly.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.160]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the Green
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.880]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the Black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.640]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.680]   probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.280]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.560]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.600]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.840]   other teas in the world.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.800]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.200]   free U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:36.000]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12 tea

[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.640]   Okay, so if I have a Chase Reserve or I have even a Chase Sapphire Preferred, the
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.880]   everyday spending card is the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.160]   Does Amex have a good kind of everyday points earning card for all those other
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:30.920]   categories?
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.440]   No, not really.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.920]   Like they do on the business side.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.360]   So like for anyone who runs a business and is listening, like the Blue Business Plus
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.280]   will just give you 2x on everything up to $50,000 in spend.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.360]   So that is one of my 19 cards and I just hit that 50 and then I put it in the
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.800]   sock drawer, like it's done.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.960]   That's another 100,000 Amex points like easily accrued.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.720]   Just so people know, you do need to have a business to do this, but that business
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.560]   doesn't have to employ people.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:05.000]   If you freelance on the side, if you sell things on eBay, like anything that counts
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.960]   as a business can make you eligible for a business card.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.680]   I had a startup and I was able to get a business card, but before that I didn't.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.000]   But every now and then I did some consulting work for a few hours here and
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.560]   that counted.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.480]   And then at one point in time, I drove for Lyft to make some extra cash during the
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.200]   New Year's season and that kind of stuff.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.360]   And I counted that as business.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.640]   So there are various ways.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.920]   It doesn't mean you have to own a company that employs people to necessarily be
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.080]   eligible for a business card.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.040]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   We got an article that talks just about this actually, because a lot of people were
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.720]   asking about it.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.840]   And so, yeah, you don't need any sort of like complex or big business at all.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.760]   And then you unlock like the business cards, to be fair, like are super exciting
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.960]   because they have huge bonuses.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.520]   And then if you're a business owner too, like in your, you're paying for Facebook
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.600]   ads or things like that, like they reward you three times points per dollar spent.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   One of the Amex business gold will give you four.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.440]   So if you're regularly spending in these categories, like business owners is like a
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.800]   whole kind of separate topic, but there's a ton of great cards.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.960]   One thing that you've taught me in prior conversations that I want to make sure is
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:16.920]   clear when you're using the Amex gold, it works at groceries and you get four points
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.080]   per dollar at grocery stores, but it gets you nothing.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.880]   If you're going to Home Depot, it gets you nothing if you're going to any other drug
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.520]   store, but you can buy gift cards at the grocery store.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.600]   So the hack you taught me was go to the grocery store with your 4X points on
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.400]   groceries, buy your Home Depot gift cards, and then go to Home Depot and pay for
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.600]   everything with gift cards. And you can get the 4X without having to do it.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.280]   And that was like such a good hack.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.960]   Yeah, this is one of the coolest hacks.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.440]   And by the way, it's not like something that's worked for six weeks and probably
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.120]   won't work again.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.920]   Like I've been doing this for at least eight years.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:00.720]   Like I, whenever I make any purchase on Amazon, it's off the back of me buying a
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.480]   gift card at say a supermarket store or an office one.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.840]   I'll talk through the office one in a minute.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.360]   But with the gold, yeah, you get 4X at supermarkets.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.880]   They have tons of different gift cards there.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   You can grab an Amazon one and then load up your Amazon account.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.720]   I mean, it's super easy. It takes you like one minute or iTunes or the airlines as
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:23.080]   well. So again, coming back to like, why would you use the Southwest credit card to
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.520]   purchase a flight with them when you could just buy like a Southwest gift card or
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.000]   multiple of them and you get 4X on them?
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.720]   So it's a really sweet hack.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.280]   And there's so many retailers as well.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.160]   So it's not just like you're reduced to only a couple of options.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.840]   Amazon is a biggie because everyone spends money on Amazon.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.080]   You should not be just using like a normal credit card to get one point per dollar
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.880]   spent. Load them up with these gift cards that you've earned like 4X off.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:51.120]   For business owners, if you you can get like the Ink Cash, which gives you five times
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.840]   points at office stores.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.440]   So I go there all the time and I load up on some of the same similar retailers.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:03.080]   So that's a way for me to like top up my chase points by going to the office store to
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.880]   buy those gift cards. And then on the Amex side, I can go to the supermarkets, right, and
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.240]   get 4X off and be getting the gift cards that way.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.000]   And this is not like cutting out a coupon or spending hours doing something like that.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.040]   If you go to the supermarket to buy food, just throw some gift cards in, like job done.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   Like they don't give you hassle about it.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.480]   Any other hacks to earn extra points beyond spending?
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.000]   Yeah, this one's kind of cool.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.760]   So if you hold something like one of the Platinum's or if you hold actually the gold
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   card, when you log into your Amex account, they may have said, hey, do you want to sign
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:43.080]   up to our pay over time feature, which basically means that if you've made a purchase
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.840]   of $100 or more, you can pay it over time, which we don't want to do because that would
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.680]   mean that you're paying interest and all that horrible stuff.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:56.320]   But by simply just saying yes, I would like the ability to be able to do this.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.080]   They can give you 20,000 bonus points.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.040]   So I've done this on multiple cards.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.880]   So I've racked up like at least 40,000 points by doing this.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.920]   And again, you don't even like I've never used pay over time to pay off my statement
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.360]   every single month. But by just saying yes, I would like the option to that you can get
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.600]   up to 20,000 points.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.000]   So go into your account, check to see if you've had it.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.600]   There's also a way to they have a link that you can click on.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:24.880]   You can just go to our site or you can Google it and find out what link that you have to
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   click to see if you're targeted for that offer, because it is a targeted offer.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.960]   But in my experience, almost everyone gets off at that at some point.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.760]   I also love the offers section.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.280]   So when you're logged into Amex or Chase, they give you all these offers.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.240]   And I feel like a year or two ago, it was these crappy offers.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.640]   Spend $300 on flowers and get $10 back.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:51.720]   But this year, at least with Amex, I've gotten a $100 off a Best Buy purchase of $100.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:56.320]   I've gotten $100 at Dell off $100, $100 at Home Depot off $100.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:02.640]   So I've probably gotten $300 or $400 back from my Platinum card on purchases I already
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.360]   had to make. This microphone I'm talking on, I bought at Dell and got the entire
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:11.040]   purchase refunded. And there's no cost to adding these things.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.360]   So every month I log in, I'm like, are there offers to add?
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.960]   I'm tempted to just add all of them just in case I go buy something online.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.440]   So I know you can only add $100 to one card.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.960]   OK, so of course, Alex knows the answer.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.680]   He's tried.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.160]   Yeah, a member of our Facebook group said, oh, what's going on?
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.640]   I can't add any more Amex offers to my card.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.440]   I was like, how many do you have?
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.200]   Screenshot 100. I was like, yeah, you've got enough of it.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.240]   Yeah, there's some really good ones I added.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   Hyatt have got one at the moment.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.000]   So spend $300 and get $60 back.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.080]   So 20% off, basically, which is super cool.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.840]   There's loads of ones around like Booze and Wine.com and everything like that.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.800]   But oh, yeah, this was a cool one.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.400]   So with my Amex Gold, you get $10 per month that you can spend on Uber Eats just by
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.960]   having the card. But they've also got an Amex offer, which I've added to my card
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:05.080]   that enables you, I think you get, I don't know, like $5 back for every 15 that you
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.920]   spend. And you can do this five times.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   Not only are you getting the monthly credit with just by having the card, I'm
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:17.320]   stacking that with this Amex offer that then gives me like $5 back for every 15.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.440]   Yeah, there are some great offers.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.960]   And you're right, they're so aggressive with them now.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.240]   There's just so many of them.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.400]   And they're easier to find, like they used to be buried.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.440]   Chase are behind, like Chase offers suck.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.760]   They're really not very good.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.200]   The other stacking thing, a lot of these have a lot of these points, portals and
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.000]   airlines have these shopping portals.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.720]   Yeah. And I always say before you buy anything online, make sure there's not some
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.560]   website that has a browser extension or a link you can click to earn more.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.840]   And oftentimes, I think some of the, you know, I go to Cashback Monitor.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.280]   Yeah, I look at who has the highest percent cash back.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.680]   And oftentimes the cash back makes sense.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.560]   But if you're someone who's new to points and you're just trying to see how quickly
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:03.000]   can I get to my goal for this trip, whether it's 100, 200,000 points, you can go to
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.280]   Chase and click on a link at Chase's website to some retailer online like Macy's
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.320]   to go buy a gift for someone and they're on the holidays.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.600]   And I might earn three, four, five points per dollar spent.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:20.440]   And then I can pay for it with my Chase card and earn another one or two points
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.840]   per dollar. The shopping portals can be a great way to accelerate your points earning.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:30.160]   Yeah. And with the portals as well, like this, you might not earn thousands and
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.000]   thousands of dollars by doing this once.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.560]   But since we all online shop, just have a quick check to see if there's a multiplier
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.240]   bonus happening at one of the shopping portals.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:44.720]   This is literally how you start racking up thousands of points over the year, because
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.240]   now when you're buying something online, you're maybe going through a portal.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.840]   If you're going to Amazon, well, wait a minute.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.880]   I got my gift cards at the supermarket.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.920]   And when I'm booking a flight, like I'm getting five X points, like all of these
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.080]   different strategies together.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.160]   This is how I say you rack up tons and tons of points.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.400]   So the shopping portals is good.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.920]   They also have the dining the dining programs as well.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.200]   Oh, yeah. Not quite as exciting.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:12.960]   But you just basically add your card to specific airlines or hotels dining program.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:18.840]   And then if you were to go to one of the restaurants in their network, they will give
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.520]   you bonus points for every dollar that you spent on top of whatever that card gives
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:27.680]   you. So, for example, with the gold, if you went and dined at a restaurant that was
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   part of American Airlines dining portal program, you would earn four on the card.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.680]   And then for all of that restaurant could be giving you five on top of it.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.480]   So you come out with nine times points per dollar spent.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.840]   And over the course of the months and the years, like you really do earn loads and
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.680]   loads of points. So I like to use those as well.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.360]   So you have 19 cards.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.440]   I assume you have points across many different programs.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:56.760]   Is there any easy way that you can organize all of that and keep track of where your
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.000]   points are, how many you have?
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.440]   Is there anything that makes that simple?
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.560]   Yeah. So I like to use Award Wallet.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.600]   They have a pretty good feature there where you can just load up all of your accounts
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.720]   and then they'll automatically check those accounts periodically to give the most
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.520]   recent balances that you have.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.640]   And so you can see like in one screen, oh, here are all my different accounts is the
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.280]   total that I have. That's cool because, yeah, if you take it to the extreme like me,
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.360]   it can quickly get out of hand and you need to be a little bit organized or you can do
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.520]   things like spreadsheets and just like once a month you do like a quick balance check.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.360]   But I do. Yeah, I do that feature that they have at Award Wallet.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.720]   I know when you transfer points from Amex or Chase to different airlines, you're still
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:43.000]   relying on the availability of award travel, which sometimes might not be
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.480]   open the days you want to fly.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.240]   If you want to just fly whenever you can and you don't want all those restrictions, is
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:55.600]   there a way to use your points, either the shopping portal or the travel portal or
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.480]   something that still makes it better than a cashback card?
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:03.280]   Or if I want to be able to fly on any flight at any time, am I actually better off just
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.120]   getting cash back?
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.440]   Well, remember, the points cards in the first place are going to earn you more points for
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.200]   every dollar that you spend, so you're already ahead by choosing a points card.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.600]   So if you decide then to use that in the most simplistic way in a travel portal, you're
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.120]   going to end up like getting the most amount of value.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.040]   And the great thing about the portals is that there are essentially like no blackout
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.400]   dates, like no restrictions, and you can book pretty much any flight that you want.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.280]   I mean, Chase is literally port with Expedia, so it's like you're using Expedia.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.080]   And what kind of value do you get?
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.800]   If you have the Chase Apple Reserve, you'll get 1.5 cents per point in value, which is
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.360]   awesome, considering that you may have earned three times points on travel purchases and
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.480]   dining purchases.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.960]   So each of those points is then being redeemed at one and a half.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.360]   I'm not a very good mathematician, but I think that works out to getting a 4.5 percent
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.080]   cashback, essentially.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:06.520]   Yeah, even if you can go on the most optimal trip, if you're as flexible as possible and
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.480]   you want to say, I'll go anywhere in the world in first class on any day, you're going to
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.880]   get the most points if you transfer to an airline.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.840]   And we should do a whole episode on how to do those transfers, how to find that
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.600]   availability. And that'll come soon.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.240]   And stay tuned because we won't get into that at all today.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:28.720]   But even if you just book through the portal, you're getting four and a half, maybe five
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.160]   if it was a platinum card, maybe more like you can still get a value that's greater than
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.040]   just getting one and a half or two cents back.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.800]   So Chase Reserve, Amex Gold, great cards for earning points, platinum, great card for
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:47.360]   perks. The other big way to accrue points is not just spending on your credit card, but
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.680]   the huge sign up bonuses you get signing up for cards.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.480]   I remember one time in the same day I signed up for three Citi American Airline cards
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:03.560]   and earned something like 75,000 each for 225,000 points in one go.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   And the requirement was to spend two or three thousand dollars over a period of time,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.600]   which I was able to do.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.160]   I know that's a huge way people gain points.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.400]   Are there any big sign up bonuses now?
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.360]   So right now there are some incredible bonuses that are happening.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.080]   The Chase Sapphire Preferred, like the 80,000 points, it's always like 60,000.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.560]   So you get like another 20,000, which is really cool.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.720]   And then the Amex Platinum, they bump that up from like the usual 60,000 to 75,000.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.640]   And on our website, we actually have an article on how you can get up to 125,000 points
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.240]   from the Amex Platinum. There's a super cool way of getting a targeted offer.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.960]   Put that and everything we've discussed will all be in the show notes.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.360]   Check it out. Yeah, definitely.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.920]   Because if you're going to sign up for the Platinum, one thing I haven't mentioned is
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.280]   that you can only get a sign up bonus from a card once in your lifetime.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.920]   So better make sure that with something like the Amex Platinum that you reach for that
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.400]   100,000 points or minimum 75,000, don't settle for that 60,000 points.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.560]   The Amex Gold has also bumped theirs up.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.600]   I think it's usually 35,000 and they've got that at 60,000, like literally like every
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.480]   card, nearly every card has increased their bonuses right now.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.320]   And it's the banks catching up to all the stuff that happened in the pandemic.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.960]   So if you're thinking about jumping on a card, I would massively recommend that you
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.640]   look into it ASAP because the bonuses are just so strong, like the Chase Alpha Reserve
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.520]   has bumped up to like 60,000 and it's usually at 50.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.600]   Business cards are big as well, like the Inc.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.160]   Business preferred 100,000 points for a $95 annual fee card.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.240]   Like the 100,000 points, even if you use them in the worst possible way, is worth over
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.520]   $1,000. Even if that was for like, I think gift cards would be maybe a little bit less.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.800]   But don't be doing that. If you used it in the portal, it would be $1,250.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.760]   So big, big bonuses.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.440]   Honestly, there aren't that many cards that haven't increased their offer right now.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.280]   And one thing I think this, correct me if this isn't true anymore, but I know Chase has
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.720]   a pretty hard rule when you're opening new cards that if you've opened more than five
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.600]   cards in the last two years, you're not going to get another one.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.520]   Is that still the way they operate?
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.720]   Yeah, they call it the 5/24 rule.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.440]   It's not an official rule, but it's basically like what the optimizers have found out.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.840]   What makes this relevant to you is that if you're thinking of getting a few Chase cards,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.720]   get those first before you then jump on, say, an Amex card or a Citi card or whatever.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:35.240]   Because if you take out more than five cards in a 24 month period, you're not going to
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.680]   be able to take out that Chase card that you're looking at.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.600]   So that's why if you love the Chase Sapphire Preferred 80,000 bonus points, but you also
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.840]   like the Amex Gold and maybe you've taken out a few cards in the last year or two, grab
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.760]   that Sapphire Preferred first and then get the Amex afterwards.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.440]   I just saw an ad yesterday for the Capital One Venture card, 100,000 points.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.760]   Does that have a place?
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.160]   We haven't talked about that card at all.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:09.560]   Yeah, so Capital One have really stepped up because now you can transfer miles that you
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:14.560]   accrue with them to airline and hotel partners just like Chase, just like Citi, just like
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.280]   Amex. Previously, they didn't do that.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.280]   So the miles that you accrued, you would have to use for statement credits and things like
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.800]   that or something in their travel portal, which wasn't very valuable.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.120]   But now you can transfer them to partners.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.080]   So yes, like 100,000 points on a venture is a monster sign up bonus.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.720]   And if you're looking at Capital One cards, that could be a really good one.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.440]   Again, I think they have 15 or 16 different transfer partners.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.840]   And a couple of years ago, they had none.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.160]   So they've realized that everyone is being lured in by Chase cards and Amex cards.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.480]   So that's great for the consumer because now the bonuses are going up because Capital
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.880]   One, like they want your business and then Chase are annoyed.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.720]   So they increase the sign up bonuses and make everything so much more lucrative.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.640]   It's great for us. It's so good for us.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.560]   If you look back five years ago, like it was pretty nuts to have 100,000 bonus.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.640]   And it was nuts to have four times points per dollar spent on things like supermarkets
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.600]   and dining and everything like that almost didn't exist.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.000]   The competition has gone pretty crazy.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.160]   Like this last five years.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.080]   So genuinely, like now is a really good time to be looking at cards because those bonuses
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.760]   are massive and they've adjusted the benefits to the pandemic.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.600]   They're like not loads of people want to travel.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.120]   So I'm going to give you a ton of statement credits at grocery stores.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.040]   I'm going to give you a bunch of stuff back on dining or delivery.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.000]   That's why all these Uber Eats passes are being marketed everywhere.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.320]   And that's why they're baked into a lot of these cards.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.320]   So to be fair, they've done a good job.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.360]   The issue is of adjusting to the current environment.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.560]   And it makes those cards, like to me, like even more useful.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.840]   Yeah, I remember once I applied for a chase card, I didn't get it.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.160]   I called up the reconsideration phone number, which you can find just googling around.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.560]   And I ended up getting them to reconsider and I got the card.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.720]   Is that something that still happens?
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.560]   Can you still do that?
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.960]   So if you ever apply for a card and you're not instantly approved, you definitely want
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.120]   to phone up the reconsideration line, because often they just need a little bit more
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.040]   information. And by giving that information, it gives them enough confidence to then give
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.440]   you the approval for the card.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.800]   It doesn't always work.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.920]   Sometimes there's a legitimate reason why you haven't been accepted for a card.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.520]   But I always will phone up the reconsideration.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.960]   It's worked for a bunch of friends, too.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.280]   Definitely worth the time.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.200]   And actually, you get through pretty quickly on reconsideration lines.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.040]   So when you open these cards up for sign up bonuses, if they're not cards that you
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.520]   necessarily spend regularly on, how long do you keep them open?
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.120]   Do you close them at the end of the year?
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.280]   Do you close them as soon as the bonus posts?
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.080]   Yeah, so it used to be a lot more lax.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.440]   So you used to be able to just sign up for the bonus, spend one dollar more than the
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.520]   minimum spend and then close it.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.880]   And the banks would be a bit annoyed or the airlines would be annoyed.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.480]   But it was fine.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.520]   You could do that. Now it's much riskier.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.240]   So let's say, for example, you get a hundred thousand bonus of a plan and you want to
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.920]   close it. It is not unheard of for them to take that bonus back from you.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.800]   So my recommendation is that you want to spend quite a bit more than the minimum spend
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.000]   on a card so that if you then later want to close it, you wouldn't run into any trouble.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.240]   Now, to answer your question about what I do, if it's a no annual fee card, it is a
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.280]   sock drawer card.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.880]   I keep it open because that helps with my credit, because the longer that you've had
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.080]   a card open for, the higher that your credit score will go up in the portion that looks
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.200]   at that section. If it's no annual fee and it's not causing you any bother, just keep
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.240]   it open. Obviously, if it has an annual fee, you're going to have to like make an
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   assessment. Wait a minute.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240]   I'm paying, say, 200 a year, 300 a year.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.600]   Am I using any of these benefits?
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.000]   Am I using any of these perks?
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.640]   If it was purely a sign up bonus play, like I mentioned, just make sure that you're
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.480]   spending more than what the minimum requirement is before you cancel it.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.880]   And yeah, cancel it towards the very end, because they may offer you like the story
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.160]   that you shared with me. They may offer you a statement credit on the entire annual fee
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.400]   when you phone up and you just never know.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.360]   Like I got that 50000 points from Amex Platinum and there's been a few other scenarios
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.200]   as well. But there's no reason to close it.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.760]   And it's actually a bit risky to close it, say, in month five or month six and wait
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.000]   until the annual fee is going to kick in, give them a call and just see what they
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.160]   offer you. Like they could offer you something really awesome.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.040]   And you're like, oh, actually, I did want to close this, but now they've offered me
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.320]   40000 points.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.640]   Yeah, I don't want to close it anymore.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:44.160]   Yeah. When the Chase Reserve came out and it was 3x on dining and travel, I had the
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.640]   preferred, which was 2x on dining and travel.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.920]   And I thought, I'm never going to use this card again.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.040]   But one thing that you can also do is you can downgrade cards.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:56.680]   Now, not I don't think every credit card company lets you do this.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.720]   I know Chase does.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.160]   But I called up and said, oh, is there any free card you have that I can downgrade this
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.760]   to? Because I didn't want to lose the history on that card.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.120]   Yeah, I did the same thing.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.840]   I had a United card for that was the first card I got in college, and it was really
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.520]   helping my credit in terms of how long of a history I had.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.720]   And it turns out, even though they don't really market it that heavily on the website,
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.480]   there is a no annual fee United card that I downgraded to.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.520]   So if you can't get them to waive the annual fee or give you a bonus, you might be able
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.160]   to downgrade it to a free card and put it in a drawer.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.560]   But I would say if you've had it for a long time and it's really helping your credit,
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.240]   it's worth at least once a year.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.600]   Go make a purchase.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.280]   Just make sure you spend something because unfortunately, that United card got shut down
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.640]   and my average length of credit history dropped because that was the only card I'd had
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.800]   for more than 10 years.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.440]   I, yeah, I downgraded actually think about I downgraded the Sapphire Preferred to a
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.560]   Freedom card or something.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.080]   So, yeah, like it keeps all that great history and doesn't hurt anything.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.280]   And it's a no annual fee card.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.320]   And you can set up a reminder or something to make a purchase, or you can sometimes
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.680]   people have a tiny recurring annual fee for a specific service.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.120]   Just stick it on that, stick it on that card, you know, so there's at least one
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:12.920]   transaction a year.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.840]   I like that strategy.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.240]   Alex, this was amazing.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:21.080]   I feel like I thought I knew a lot about credit cards and points and I feel like I know
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.120]   even more now.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:27.160]   Hopefully, everyone has a new strategy to take an amazing vacation.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:34.120]   Where can people find you, Upgraded Points and anything else you're excited about
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.960]   online? Yeah, thanks, Chris.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.800]   I really enjoyed the chat and Upgraded Points is my website.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.840]   And we got over 2000 articles there.

[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.000]   today and plenty of other topics as well.

[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.560]   There will be lots of links in the show notes for sure.

[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.960]   And thank you so much for listening.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.320]   I can't believe it's already been three shows.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.080]   I'm already working on lining up the next few episodes.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.360]   But in the meantime, I would love to know if there are any other topics you want to
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.680]   hear about on the show or questions you have for me or even hacks that you know about
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.720]   that you want me to share.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.520]   You can email any of those to Chris@AllTheHacks.com.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.280]   I really want to make this show great for all of you.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.600]   So please reach out by email, on Twitter if you have any feedback or other ideas.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.960]   And to everyone who's already left a review or a rating, thank you so much.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   If you haven't, it's never too late and it would really help the show out.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.920]   It's one of the main ways that Apple decides what to feature.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.200]   Or if you want to share the show with a friend, that'd be amazing, too.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.640]   So thank you so much.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.400]   And I'm really excited to keep this going.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.440]   Have a great day.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.200]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.360]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.080]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.320]   is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.600]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.920]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.640]   entertaining.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.160]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.280]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.240]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.880]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.520]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.480]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.240]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.720]   your money and grow your wealth.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.880]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.240]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.720]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
