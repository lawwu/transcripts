[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.120]   Today on Medical Personal Finance we talk about the rule of 72.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.960]   One of those very useful little mental math shortcuts that you can use to estimate the
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.680]   effect of various growth rates and calculate how long it takes you to double your money.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.440]   knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.120]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   Hey, guess what?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880]   If you're going to do 10 years or less, do you know how much money you need at the end
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   of 10 years?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.800]   And do you know how long it'll take your money to double in 10 years?
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.520]   What interest rate you need to double your money in 10 years?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.160]   That's why the rule of 72 is useful.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.920]   Jumping back into the financial planning shows here today.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.200]   I've been on hiatus for quite a while here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.440]   Traditionally, I like to do Wednesdays as a financial planning show.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.760]   And the reason for that – I know for some of you, financial planning shows have been
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   your favorite.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   That was what brought you here to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.240]   You said, "Hey, Joshua says he's teaching his way through the CFP curriculum and that
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   has been my intention and my intent."
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.840]   And so that brought a number of you here.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.400]   What I learned in doing the financial planning shows is as measured by download numbers,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.120]   meaning popularity of the shows, there tends to be quite a bit of variability among different
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   shows.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   I know that some people are subscribed to the show where their phone, the app on your
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.000]   phone just simply automatically downloads every show.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.500]   But many people don't listen to every show.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.640]   Many people just simply dip in and dip out when they want to and they choose based upon
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.240]   the title that sounds interesting to them.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   And so I can see the variability of different shows.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.000]   I can measure what's more popular and what's less popular based upon the number of downloads
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.120]   of a show and that could just simply be what's more popular in terms of the title of a show
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.560]   or what's a catchier title, et cetera.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.600]   So I can also then judge the popularity of shows based upon the actual feedback that
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.940]   I get, the emails that I get, the comments that show up on the show page, et cetera.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.120]   So traditionally, as I've been doing these financial planning shows, they have often
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.680]   been my least popular shows, some of the shows that have been downloaded the least and also
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.960]   from a preparation perspective, they take me the most time to prepare.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.600]   When I do some complex show trying to go over various types of annuities or types of life
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.960]   insurance, et cetera, in order to get that content clear and concise, it takes a tremendous
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.920]   amount of preparation time to do that.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.520]   So I haven't had a huge motivation to follow through on these financial planning shows
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.600]   seemingly because the audience doesn't seem to resonate with them as much as with other
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   topics and it takes a lot of time.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.620]   That said, it is still important to me to do so.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.800]   And today, we're going back to my outline of certified financial planner topics and
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.000]   crossing off one here called the Rule of 72, just a quick little valuable – hopefully
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   valuable tool and little piece of math, a little mental math shortcut that I want you
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   to be equipped with.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.680]   That's the purpose of today's show as we get back to the CFP curriculum.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.200]   I don't promise to give you one of these every Wednesday.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.960]   I will do my best to do them consistently and I have some chosen but it's largely
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.320]   based upon what I'm able to do and when I'm able to do it.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   So please be patient with me as I do my best to deliver the content for you on a consistent
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.080]   basis.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.320]   The Rule of 72 is a mental math shortcut that you can use to calculate how long it will
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.520]   take a pot of money to double.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   It doesn't have to be money.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.640]   It just basically measures how long if you have a mathematical quantity that is going
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.420]   to be governed by compounding interest, how long will it take that to double or to have
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.960]   if you're going the other way.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.160]   The way that you do this math is you take the number 72 and you divide it by the interest
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.960]   rate and you can generally do this in your head and get a good rough idea of how much
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.140]   money we're going to be talking about.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.960]   So very simply, if for example you think that you can earn 6% on your money, then you just
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.920]   simply take 72, divide by 6 and the answer of course that you get is 12, 12 years.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.760]   Six times 12 is 72.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.920]   So you get 12 years.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.080]   That's how long it will take for your money to double.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:35.760]   $100,000 in the bank invested at 6% interest will equal $200,000 at the end of 12 years.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.480]   If you want your money to double every decade, you can calculate what interest rate you require
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   in order to accomplish that.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.120]   So you would take as a simple example, 72 divided by 10 and that's 7.2%.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.920]   If you have a million dollars, you don't spend any of the money, if you can invest
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.960]   it at 7.2%, at the end of a decade, you'll have $2 million.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.720]   And that process then could be repeated the following decade.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.880]   Now of course compounding works against you the other way.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.520]   If you're using this to compare an expense, for example something like inflation, then
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.880]   you'll see the effect go the other way.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.040]   On yesterday's – yesterday's show?
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.320]   Yesterday's show, I talked about – yes, excuse me, where I talked about the numbers
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.360]   of a million dollars value of 1998 when Tom Stanley first published his book The Millionaire
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   Next Door.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.200]   Here in 2017, I said that if you were a millionaire back then, you need a million and a half dollars
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.720]   to have the same purchasing power that you had back then.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.280]   Well, that's coming up on 20 years.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.680]   And if you wanted to say, well, how much would it be to double?
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.840]   What if I had to have $2 million?
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.240]   What would an inflation rate be for me to have to have $2 million in 20 years?
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.360]   The answer would be three and a half percent.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.500]   72 divided by 3.5 comes out to about 20.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.560]   So there's where we get our 20 years.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.760]   It's a big deal because just a small move in inflation rates means that your money is
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.280]   losing value much more quickly.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.040]   If inflation rate goes from 2 percent to 3 percent, which is a very normal calculation,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.960]   the number that I used yesterday was I believe the inflation calculator I plugged that number
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.920]   into is like 2.5 percent, somewhere around there.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.080]   But if you used – if the inflation rate goes from 2 percent to 3 percent, that means
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.000]   that your money will lose half of its value in 24 years instead of 36.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.320]   That's a decade.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   That's a big, big difference when it comes to inflation rates.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   Of course also you can use this for expenses that you may face.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.280]   So there's the cost of healthcare or the cost of college tuition.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.120]   You can take that number.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.280]   Let's say that cost of healthcare, cost of college tuition is going up at 5 percent
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:03.320]   per year, then that means that about 15 years from now, you're going to have double the
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.320]   expenses.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.280]   72 divided by 5 equals 14.4.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.720]   So let's call that 15 years from now.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.640]   Now why is this useful?
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.880]   It's useful because it has a way of translating something that we don't particularly know
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.260]   how to connect with, interest rates, into something that we do know how to connect with
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:32.760]   a little bit easier, money doubling and money doubling in a certain number of years.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.120]   If I talk about investment A that has the potential to return a 5 percent interest rate
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.680]   or investment B that has the potential to return 7 percent interest rate, depending
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.120]   on your familiarity with investing, that might or might not sound like a big deal.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.280]   For most people, the difference between 5 percent and 7 percent doesn't sound like
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.440]   a big deal.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.600]   But the rule of 72 tells us that if we invest at 5 percent, our money will double in 14.5
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.320]   years or if we invest at 7 percent, our money will double in 10.5 years.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.980]   So we can see here that that small, relatively small 2 percent difference, when we put that
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:22.800]   into a compounding formula, it makes a huge difference on how quickly our money grows.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:31.120]   If you are 30 years old and you can double your money every 10 years versus every 15
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:39.840]   years, that will make a huge difference in how much money you have at the age of 70.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.960]   The person who is investing their money at 7 percent, thus doubling their money every
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.380]   10 years, has the opportunity to have four entire doubles.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.840]   Their money can double over four times once per decade.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.600]   The person who's investing at 5 percent, on the other hand, has 40 years investing,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.160]   has the possibility of doubling their money only 2.78 times.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.040]   So it's called 2.8 times.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   Well, when you think about, let's say you have $200,000 a day, $200,000 doubled four
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.480]   times leaves you with $3.2 million after the fourth doubling.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.040]   But if it's only doubled three times, that leaves you with $1.6 million after the doubling.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.520]   This is a big deal, huge deal.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.400]   I think personally I'm probably guilty of being somewhat cavalier when it comes to interest
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.120]   rates here on the show.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.880]   I generally try to make conservative estimates and I use various numbers at various times,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.140]   but I shouldn't be so cavalier and you shouldn't get the impression that there's a small difference
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:54.040]   between a 5 percent rate of return and a 7 percent rate of return.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.720]   There's a huge difference between those two numbers.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.420]   It's a big, big deal.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.560]   That's why when it comes to investing, everything matters.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.160]   The fact that you invest the portfolio into an investment that has a higher probability
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.600]   for a high, excuse me, that has a high probability for a higher rate of return, something moving
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   towards 7 percent or 8 percent or 9 percent or 10 percent because if you're investing
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:31.560]   in stocks and bonds because it's more heavily weighted to stocks, that's a big, big deal.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   The fact that you choose CDs or money market account and don't invest in stocks, that's
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.520]   also a big, big deal.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.400]   Expenses are a huge deal.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:50.580]   If we use the rule of 72 and we say if you're getting a 6 percent rate of return, 72 divided
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.460]   by 6 equals 12.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.560]   Your money will double every 12 years.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:02.040]   However, if we use a 7 percent because you can trim off a 1 percent worth of expenses,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.440]   72 divided by 7 means that your money will double every 10.29 years.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.960]   Let's calculate the impact over a 40 or 50 year investment time horizon.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.280]   It could be huge, much bigger when you go longer than that, but let's just stick with
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   40 years.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.440]   40 divided by 12 means that your money could double 3.33 times at 6 percent, but 40 divided
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   by 10.3 means that your money can double 3.88 times over the course of your 40 year investment
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.960]   career.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.680]   3.33 doubles versus 3.88 doubles is a big deal.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.440]   Think about your money at the end of your investment career and just think about that
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   number.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.500]   Let's say it's a million dollars and think about the hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.240]   that are represented by another half doubling period.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.560]   I'm getting a little tongue tied here with all these numbers in an audio format.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.800]   I apologize for that.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.400]   I want to impress upon you the fact that interest rate matters.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.520]   Expenses matter.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.800]   Tax efficiency matters.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.080]   All of these things matter.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.560]   It's a little hard for many people to sit down with a spreadsheet, build a spreadsheet
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.640]   that's going to show the impact of various rates of return and being able to visualize
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   it.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.680]   Sometimes it's a little easier for many people to recognize how quickly their money is going
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.440]   to double and how many doubling periods they can have.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.640]   The rule of 72 will help you get there.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.240]   I encourage you to use this.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.680]   If you're ever wondering how long will it take money to double or how long will it take
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:48.000]   an expense to double, just take 72 and divide it by the rate.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.880]   Hopefully that will allow you to get around some of the problems of the money, the big
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.200]   numbers which are hard for our brains to conceive of and conceptualize.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.960]   You'll be able to create a more accurate analysis for yourself.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   That's it for today.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   That's it for the rule of 72.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.320]   It's as simple as that.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.360]   But I can check the box now on my curriculum that we've talked about the rule of 72 on
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   the show.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.800]   Thank you for listening to the show.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.120]   For those of you who have been sending me voicemails for the episode 500 show, please
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   keep that up.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   You can send those to Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.080]   We're going to have a special celebratory episode for episode 500.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.120]   If you'd like to contribute your voice to that, I would love it if you would do that.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   All you need to do is just simply pull out your phone, record a quick voice memo and
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.320]   send that to me at Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.040]   Specifically just tell me how the show has impacted you.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.640]   Tell your other listeners how the show has impacted you and what progress you've made
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.520]   in the last few years of listening to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   Please try to keep that to about two to three minutes so we don't bore your fellow listeners
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   insufferably and that'll be greatly appreciated.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.040]   Two to three minutes would be perfect.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.160]   While you're at that, please send me, if you would like to, feel free to send me a picture
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   of you and your family.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.880]   I've just got that set up on a screensaver on my computer so that way when I'm recording
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.440]   the show I get to look at all your beautiful family pictures.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   I love seeing those.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.920]   It helps me to visualize who I'm speaking to each day.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   That's so helpful.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.360]   If you'd like to support the show, please consider becoming a patron of the show.
