[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.500]   We end the week with a sobering email
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.720]   from an anonymous wife who listens to the podcast
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.400]   and she's reaching out for help.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.180]   This episode is gonna cover mature themes.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.180]   So just a heads up there.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.200]   The wife writes in to say this,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.480]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm married
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.240]   "to a professing Christian husband
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240]   "with a 20 year history of hidden porn use.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.620]   "He's confessed it, though he struggles also
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.820]   "with sins like lying to look good,
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.600]   "not disciplining his children,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.760]   "and using a flippant demeanor.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.320]   "These are continuing with regularity in my husband's life.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.360]   "As far as I can tell, he's not showing fruits
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.620]   "of repentance at all.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.480]   "My question, how do I as a wife relate to him biblically?"
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.880]   Hebrews 3.13 says, "To exhort one another every day
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.600]   "as long as it is called today,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.180]   "that none of you may be hardened
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.800]   "by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.680]   But 1 Peter 3, verse one and two,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.600]   commissions women saying,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.120]   "If some husbands do not obey the word,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.200]   "they may be won without a word
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.780]   "by the conduct of their wives."
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.780]   I understand that 1 Peter 3 is commanding
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.280]   a respectful, submissive attitude that may win a husband.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.940]   I'm hung up on what the phrase without a word means.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.880]   Does it mean that a wife in my situation
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.320]   should not ever exhort her husband,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.340]   as it says in Hebrews 3?
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980]   Should I never bring up my concerns
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.920]   over the continuing sin that wreaks havoc in our home?
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.880]   I would truly appreciate any insight
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.040]   or advice you can give me.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.740]   - Not many things are more heavy on the heart
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520]   than long-term marital disappointment.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.520]   We hoped that there would be sweet harmony
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.820]   in those early days and spiritual mutuality,
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.720]   and there has been very little of either,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360]   maybe for decades.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.580]   And we see our whole life going by,
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.700]   imagining what might have been,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.020]   and it can be utterly disheartening.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340]   So one of the things that needs to be dealt with is,
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.340]   what if change, say in this husband, never comes?
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.900]   All the things you dreamed, hoped, prayed for, don't happen.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.120]   And I wanna say loud and clear that there is grace,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.440]   there is great grace for that situation,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.320]   even grace for flourishing in it, not just coping with it.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.200]   And there is great reward forever and ever and ever
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.880]   for those who endure in a godly, Christ-exalting way
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.720]   the disappointments of this life.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.180]   Now, that's not what she's asking.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.680]   (laughs)
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   But I felt neat, I felt it's important to say it.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.240]   She's not asking how to cope with disappointment,
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.800]   but rather, what strategies are permitted or encouraged
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.180]   for a godly wife to seek change in her husband
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.800]   who's living in sinful ways?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.720]   So let me offer a few clarifications
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.480]   of what I hear in this question.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   First, 1 Peter 3, 1 to 6, is dealing most immediately
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   with a woman who is married to an unbelieving husband.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.360]   I say that because when verse one of chapter three says
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.920]   that they do not obey the word,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.440]   that language elsewhere in 1 Peter refers
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.720]   to believing the gospel and becoming a Christian.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   For example, verse 22 of chapter one
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.800]   refers to having purified your souls
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.020]   by obedience to the truth, which in the context means
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.680]   having obeyed the command in the gospel to believe
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.080]   and thus experiencing its purifying power.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.600]   And same thing in chapter four, verse 17,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.400]   if judgment begins with us, what will be the outcome
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.120]   of those who do not obey the gospel?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.320]   Which again refers to those who do not obey the command
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   to believe the gospel and be saved.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.000]   So when 1 Peter 3, 1 says,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   wives be subject to your own husbands
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.800]   so that if some do not obey the word,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.280]   they may be won without a word
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.540]   by the conduct of their wives.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.340]   It's referring to marriage to an unbelieving husbands.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.300]   Now, the reason that matters in this case
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   is that massive new realities are in play
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.580]   when we are dealing with a professing Christian husband
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.100]   and professing Christian wife.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.380]   And that's not the case in 1 Peter 3, verse one,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.980]   but is the case in this question that I'm being asked.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.300]   New factors come into play
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.420]   when we are talking about two Christians.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.460]   For example, with regard to the husband,
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.600]   under God, he is not only responsible to his wife
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.780]   to live with her in a certain way,
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.780]   like providing for her, protecting her,
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.060]   leading her spiritually, honoring her,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   as it says in Ephesians 5.25 to 33 and 1 Peter 3.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.640]   Not only those new realities are in play,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.220]   but this Christian husband is also responsible
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.180]   to the leaders of his church.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.660]   Hebrews 13.17, obey your leaders and submit to them.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.940]   He's responsible to his church covenant,
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.020]   that is to the biblical implications
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.460]   of being a member of the body of Christ.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.220]   That's what the biblical language of members of Christ
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.320]   means in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.300]   The body does not consist of one member, but of many.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.540]   One cannot say to the other, I have no need of you.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.260]   This husband can't say that about the other Christians
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.540]   in the church, especially his leaders.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.680]   You are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.220]   Now, whether he thinks in these terms or not,
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.660]   that's true about this husband,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.940]   and he needs to think in those terms.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.620]   He needs those other believers.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.560]   He needs those Christian leaders in his life.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.300]   The Christian husband is not a freestanding moral agent
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.020]   doing whatever he please in this marriage.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.620]   He is a member, an arm, a leg, a finger, an ear, a tongue.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.620]   He's a member of Christ and responsible to Christ
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.980]   as the head and other members,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.400]   especially the leaders of the body of Christ
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.540]   that he's a part of.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.540]   That's true of the wife as well,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.260]   which means that this marriage is not an isolated couple
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.220]   with no accountable relationships.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.100]   They are part of the body of Christ.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.100]   She and he have recourse to the church for help.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.320]   They are members of Christ's body.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   Now, in this case, the husband does not seem
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.700]   to be seeking help from the body of Christ
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.340]   or from the leaders, but rather is prone, she says,
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.820]   to cover up, to cover up his need
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.940]   rather than seek help for it,
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   which means that more of the burden is falling to his wife,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.420]   which is not the way it's supposed to be,
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.100]   and it is putting her in a very difficult position.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   So let me underline for her the new realities
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.320]   that her belonging to Christ bring into play
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.620]   in this marriage.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.260]   For example, she's not only his wife
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.740]   with the biblical implications that has for submission,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.880]   which I'll come back to in a minute,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.440]   but she is also his sister in Christ
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.380]   with appropriate implications
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.280]   for how a caring brother and sister
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.320]   might speak to each other.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.920]   She's his fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.640]   which implies a kind of regal dignity as God's daughter,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.800]   which, if she's mature, has implications
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.980]   for dealing with her co-heir, her husband,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.640]   in a mature and humble and fitting way.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.360]   She is, as we've seen, a member of the body of Christ,
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.720]   as he is, which implies, as Paul says,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   that we are individually members of one another.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.200]   That is, she's part of her husband's very being,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.800]   and to speak to him is, in a profound sense,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.200]   to speak to herself, also because they are one flesh,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.980]   which has profound significance
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.640]   in view of the golden rule, do unto others
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400]   as you would have them do unto you,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.480]   because in this case, he is you.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.520]   And she's also indwelt by the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.840]   which means not only that she has the treasures
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.620]   of wisdom and knowledge from God in her,
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.940]   but that she may be empowered at any given moment
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.000]   for some perfectly suited gift from God
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.280]   for what that husband needs,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.320]   and she's created in God's image,
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.920]   not only as all humans are, but doubly so,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.520]   because she's been recreated in the image of Christ.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.520]   As a Christian, she has, Paul says,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.480]   become a new self, a new person,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.500]   created after the likeness of God in true righteousness
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.380]   and holiness, Ephesians 4:24.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.080]   Now, I'm pointing out all of these glorious realities
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.880]   about this wife as they come into play,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   because she asks, "Should I never bring up my concerns
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.560]   over the continuing sin that wreaks havoc in our home?"
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.840]   And I want her to see that these many realities
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.240]   about her position, her identity in Christ,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.860]   in relation to the church, in relation to the Lord,
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.640]   in relation to her husband, all of them imply
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.400]   that she's fully competent to think biblically
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.880]   about herself and her husband's behavior
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.200]   and their relationship and the impact it has
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.040]   on their children, and to approach him earnestly
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.120]   with her concerns for him and for them.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.460]   Yes.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.200]   Now, I said I'd come back to the issue of submission.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   In my understanding of submission,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   none of this that I've just itemized
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.480]   about all of the wife's remarkable dignities,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.360]   none of this implies that in speaking to a husband
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   about her concerns, she would necessarily be acting
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   in an insubordinate or unsubmissive way.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   She might be.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.700]   I mean, if her attitude is wrong,
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.700]   but I think a mature, godly, Bible-saturated woman
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.840]   knows the difference between nagging a husband
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.520]   in a pushy or insubordinate way, on the one hand,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   and humbly and wisely bringing to the husband her concerns
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.640]   and seeking with him a way forward toward relational health
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.880]   that would make both of them and the children
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.020]   holier and happier.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.020]   And if they can't seem to make progress together,
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.380]   then it might mean seeking the husband's agreement
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.220]   that they would bring a wise,
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.140]   biblical counselor into their lives.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.700]   I don't think they should be ashamed of that.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.380]   It is a mark of wisdom and maturity
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.380]   when we admit that we have reached the end of our resources
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   and must seek help from some wise member
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.420]   of the body of Christ.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.460]   - Yeah, thank you for this word, Pastor John.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.160]   Not many things are heavier on the heart
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.980]   than long-term marital disappointment.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.100]   So thank you for entrusting to us questions
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.860]   on these disappointments in your own lives.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.180]   We are humbled and sobered that you send us those questions,
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.500]   those testimonies, those stories.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.660]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.280]   Well, speaking of painful ruptures in the home,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.880]   we return to the theme on Monday
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.360]   to hear from a mom of three young girls.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.720]   She is alone.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.400]   Her husband has abandoned her and her kids
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.240]   for another woman.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.520]   How does a Christian woman respond to such a deep offense?
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.360]   It's heavy.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.920]   It's actually gonna be a pretty heavy
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.280]   next couple of weeks ahead on the podcast.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.760]   I'll explain that next time.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.440]   My host Tony Rehnke and Pastor John,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.760]   and I will see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.920]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you then.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
