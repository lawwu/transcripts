[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   I want you guys to stop throwing bones to each other's side.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.720]   Pretend you're on the courtroom floor,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.840]   really trying to convince the listeners.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.720]   - If you wanna maximize your wealth,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.040]   especially early in your career,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.880]   real estate investing is by far the best way to do it.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.040]   If you have the energy to put five or 10 hours a week
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.000]   to get started in, you can literally generate returns
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   that are double that of the average of the stock market.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.240]   And yes, it does take work,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   but if you have a good entrepreneurial spirit,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   cashflow, appreciation, amortization,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.320]   value add and tax benefits
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.880]   is really unmatched in any other asset class.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.480]   - If you wanna invest easily via an app on your phone
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.200]   and you don't wanna get the 2 a.m. phone call
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840]   from a tenant whose toilet broke
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.120]   and you gotta go over there and fix it,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   check out stocks.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.160]   The unlevered return is probably the best in the world
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.000]   that you can get.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.820]   You have a little bit of money,
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.520]   you don't have enough for a down payment or big capital
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.160]   to become a big real estate investor,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.320]   and you don't have a lot of time,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.820]   Stock market investing is probably the way to go.
