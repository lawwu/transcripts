[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Good morning, Radicals. I have two very quick special requests for you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.200]   We're coming up on episode 500 of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   About 65 episodes to go.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.000]   And for episode 500, I'd like to do just something slightly different and out of the ordinary and have a celebratory episode.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   As a component of that, I'd like to hear your stories.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.200]   I receive and have received many very nice emails from you about the impact that this show has made on your life
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.600]   and some of the changes that you've made and some of the benefits that you received from those changes on your life.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   So I love those stories.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.800]   I hesitate to just read those emails on the air because it sounds very self-congratulatory.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.600]   But I would like to profile some of those stories so you can understand, so you can, so my list, so everyone can hear some of what you've done.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800]   As I built Radical Personal Finance, I've been trying to keep it very relevant.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   I want anybody who tunes into the show to recognize that wherever they are, there's someone just like them who they can learn from.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.000]   And that this journey toward financial freedom, a rich life now and financial freedom is a continuum.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.400]   And progress can be made at any stage. Progress can be made when you're in debt and just getting started.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   Progress can also be made when you're really rich.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   So I'd love to hear just a little bit of your story and share that with other listeners.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400]   So here are my instructions.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   If you could please take your phone and record a quick, short, little voice memo and send that to me.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600]   What I'd like that to be is about two to three minutes long.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   And here's some practical tips for you.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:04.100]   Just grab a piece of paper or your notes app on your phone and just write out what has been the most helpful to you about Radical Personal Finance and how you've integrated that in your life.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.400]   Some of the changes and growth that you've experienced over the last year or over the last couple of years.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.900]   What have you learned and what change has that made in your life?
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.300]   Many of you have told me about starting new careers.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.900]   Many of you told me about paying off debt.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.100]   Many of you told me about moving, about spending more time with family, about making various changes to your life.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.900]   So what has been a benefit for you?
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.700]   What has Radical Personal Finance meant to you?
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.500]   And what have you done with the content you've heard on the show?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.200]   Two to three minutes.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.800]   I recommend writing a couple of quick notes and then just grab that voice recorder app, that voice memo app that's built into every one of your phones and record a very quick voice memo of two to three minutes.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.100]   And then email it to me.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.100]   Email it to me at Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.900]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.700]   As long as your voice memo is about two minutes to three minutes, you should have no problem emailing that to me as an attachment.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.100]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.300]   Tips, do your best to get a nice quiet recording.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.100]   Two simplest ways to do that is in your car.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.900]   If you just sit in your car, pull over someplace quiet, keep your car windows up and hold your phone about six inches in front of your face, hit record and then just start talking.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.600]   The backseat will be a little bit quieter than the front seat but I don't think you have to do that for me.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.200]   I think you get good audio quality with just doing it in your car while the car is off and sitting on the side of the road.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   Or if you're in your house, a great place to record is just walk into your closet or point your face towards the clothes hanging in your closet.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So feel free.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.200]   Just tell us your first name.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:52.900]   Feel free to use a fake name if you like but tell us who you are and tell us what you've really benefited from Radical Personal Finance and how you've made changes towards living a rich life now and building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900]   Tell us what the show has meant to you and encourage your fellow listeners with your story.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400]   Really want to hear that from you.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.100]   That's thing one.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:08.100]   Thing two is if you would do me a favor please and either maybe do it in a separate email or if you just want to do one of these or the other, that's fine.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.200]   But I would ask you, please send me a picture of you and your family if you're willing.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.700]   These pictures are not – I'm not publishing them or doing anything like that.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.700]   I just want to set up and print some of these out and put them on my wall and I'm going to put it set up a little just screensaver on my computer.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.800]   And one of the constant challenges of podcasting is that I just look at a microphone most of the time.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.500]   And I imagine who you are but I'd love to see pictures of you and your family.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.000]   And I'm going to set it up with a screensaver on my computer that allows me to see you and your family's face so I know who I'm talking to.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.100]   And that's just a little favor for me.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.000]   Again, I'm not going to do anything.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.400]   They won't be published in any way.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's just I'd like to see a quick little picture.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.600]   So grab your phone, look through your recent photos, find a family picture.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.200]   It doesn't matter if it's candid or staged.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.100]   And send me a picture of you and your family so that I can know who my audience is.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:07.800]   That will help me as I continue to seek to serve you and I want to serve you with everything that you need in this area of finances.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   So personal favor for me, send me – just look in your recent photos and email me a picture, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:23.600]   So I can print you out and put you up on my wall to look at while I'm recording the show or I'll also be putting a little – just a little screensaver on my computer.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.300]   That's it.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.800]   Thank you.
