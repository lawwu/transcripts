[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   I would say my favorite Kobe story was when I was in Portland, and we had a win streak
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.860]   against the Lakers in the Rose Garden.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.800]   So I got hurt, and leading up into this game, Kobe sprains his ankle.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800]   I wouldn't say it then, but I used to watch Laker games, just as much as playing, it's
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.160]   like, "All right, now I gotta record a DVR of my Laker games," 'cause Kobe was still
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.120]   my favorite player, but I didn't want anybody to think that he had an edge on me because
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.880]   I did like him so much as a player.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.280]   So we're getting ready for the game, and they asked me, "Am I gonna play?"
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.560]   And I was just like, "Nah, I'm just not ready yet.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   I think it's my hamstring," and Kobe was like, "Gonna play if I was gonna suit up, he was
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   gonna play."
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.520]   And I was like, "No way, he hurt his ankle too bad."
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.760]   So if you was gonna play, he was gonna play?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   He was gonna play, yes.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760]   How did you know that?
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.680]   Yeah, so we'll get to it.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.120]   So long story short, they ended up scratching Kobe, and they're like, "All right, he's not
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120]   gonna play."
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.600]   They do that stuff on ESPN, and then our little pack is like, "We don't know if he's gonna
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.680]   play or not, so we're gonna prepare as if he is and go over to Kobe's sets and how they're
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   gonna play."
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.280]   So I was like, "Nah, I'm still about a week away."
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.000]   So I put it out there early, and then he's obviously in the other locker room.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.480]   We know he's in the arena, every camera follows a man.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.640]   So I'm in the training doing all my stuff, and then I go back to the locker room, and
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440]   I had a friend of mine, Chuck, he works with Nike, and then he worked with Kobe.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.600]   I was like, "Is Kobe gonna play?"
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.040]   And he was like, "If you play, he's playing."
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   I'm like, "I'm not playing."
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   He was like, "All right."
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   He said, "Nah, I don't think he's gonna play."
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040]   So I was like, "All right, cool."
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   I said, "Ask Kobe when the team's about to warm up, can I come down and say what's up?"
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.300]   He was like, "All right."
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.200]   So long story short, Chuck didn't come back in the first quarter, so he came back in the
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   second quarter.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.720]   And he was like, "Kobe said, 'Yeah, come down there, but wait 'til the team's go out and
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   come after halftime.'"
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.340]   So I was like, "For real?"
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.600]   So I'm getting all nervous.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840]   I played against him, but we never talked during the game.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.200]   He'd just be going at me.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.800]   So I was like, "For real?"
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   He was like, "Yeah."
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.960]   He said, "Come down, but let the teams go out."
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.680]   So I'm like, "All right."
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360]   So the teams, Nate come in and give his speech, both teams go out, and I'm walking up to the
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   locker room.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.040]   I'm like, "Damn, so what I'm gonna say to Kobe?"
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.940]   So I'm all nervous, and I walk all the way down the hallway.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.600]   And then I get to the door, and I'm kind of listening in, and I tap to knock on the locker
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   room door.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   And the trainer was like, "Who is it?"
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.320]   And I peek in my head, and I was like, "Oh, it's B-Roy."
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.680]   And Kobe was laying on the table.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.000]   He was fully dressed, he had his whole warm-ups on and everything, and he was laying on the
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520]   table getting stretched.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.120]   And the dude was doing something to his ankle.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.120]   So I'm like, "Oh, man."
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   I was like, "Kobe."
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.480]   And he hops up off the table, and he's like, "B-Roy, come here."
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.380]   And I went to dap him, and he gave me a bear hug.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.760]   And I was just like, "Yes, it's Kobe."
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   And then I loosened up, and he's like, "How you doing, man?"
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.760]   So I ended up sitting down, he's laying on the table, I sit in the little locker, and
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.080]   we ended up sitting there talking and joking the whole second half of the game.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   And that was, for me, not just because of his passing, but that was like, "Damn, I'm
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.880]   meeting my idol, and I get to hang out with him."
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   And talking.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   Man, I asked him everything under the sun.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.520]   I was like, "So how's your and Michael Jordan's relationship?"
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.360]   He's like, "Me and Mike's cool."
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.120]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's cool."
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.680]   But most people, I always try to look at it like, I'm in the NBA, but I'm still a fan
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   of it.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.960]   So I asked stuff that I think my dad would.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.680]   We wanted to know, "How does Kobe tie his shoes?"
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.960]   All that stuff was cool.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640]   And then I even joked, "So you really was gonna play?"
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   He was like, "Yeah, you was gonna play."
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   I was like, "Damn, you are dressed."
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   How old was you at this time?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   Man, that was my third year in the league.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   So I made the All-Star Game my second year, and it was in New Orleans.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.840]   But Kobe didn't play, 'cause he had a bad thumb.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.680]   And we really didn't talk much.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.840]   I was in awe then of him.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.720]   We had a few different things where we all did it together as a team.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   But I remember getting on a bus, and it's like, "Damn, it's Tim Duncan."
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.880]   You're in the West, they're going mellow, it's like all these great players.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.000]   Iverson's on the team, Shrafty, the next, Shaq's on the team.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.680]   So it's like all these dudes are idolized, but then it was like, "Okay, where's Kobe?"
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.440]   I'm all sitting on the bus, pacing the way, "Where's Kobe getting on the bus?"
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.520]   So then Kobe comes, and cameras follow, you get on the bus, I'm like, "Yeah, that's Kobe."
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.280]   So no, it was cool, but we didn't really have a one-on-one conversation.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.040]   I was playing well in New Orleans, and he was like, "Man, stop being nice, man, stop
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   being passive.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   You can go be MVP."
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.120]   And I'm like, "MVP at an All-Star Game?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Yeah, right."
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.640]   And he was telling me to do it, and I was like, "Man, all right, we'll see."
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.620]   But that was kind of the most of our interactions at that point.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.760]   So then that next year, like I said, he didn't play.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.880]   That's when I was able to sit down and have a real long conversation with him.
