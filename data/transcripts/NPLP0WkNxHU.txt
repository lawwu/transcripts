[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   The Bible says in verses 3, 4, and 5 in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   "And not only so, but we glory in tribulation also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.720]   and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.600]   of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:47.080]   Now these three verses, as they themselves suggest to us, are a continuation of what
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.320]   the apostle has already been saying in the first two verses.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:00.600]   You remember that we've considered them, and that there the apostle tells us of the grounds
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.440]   on which we can be certain of our salvation as the result of justification by faith only.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.800]   And the three grounds, you remember, were these.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.240]   Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.360]   That's the first thing.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.640]   Secondly, by whom also we have had our access into this grace wherein we stand.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.320]   And thirdly, we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.440]   Now we've looked at those three things.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.920]   The peace which we have with God is a proof of this.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   The fact that we are standing in this grace of God and receiving of it is further proof
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.560]   of it.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   And then thirdly, the last time we met together, we saw that we are able also to exult in the
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.640]   hope which we have of being in the presence of God, and of being glorified, and of becoming
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.360]   like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.680]   Although having said that, the apostle goes on by saying, "And not only so, that isn't
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   the end of it.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.040]   There is something," he says further, "something which is, in a sense, is even stronger."
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   It doesn't end at that, says the apostle.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.520]   Those three things are very wonderful.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.840]   But he says, "I can go on to say something which is still more wonderful."
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.960]   Because you would have thought there were sufficient grounds of assurance and of certainty
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.760]   and of a guarantee of the finality of our salvation.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   But he says, "I've got an argument which is still stronger than that."
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.400]   Well now, is this conceivable?
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.720]   Is this possible?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.280]   What is this yet stronger proof of the fact that we are saved, that we are the children
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   of God, and that we are destined for that glory that awaits us?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   And the answer is, the way in which our faith enables us to face the trials, the troubles,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.640]   the problems, and the tribulations of life.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.040]   And that is the theme with which he deals here in these three verses.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.560]   Now, it's not surprising that he should have done this, because he knew very well,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.320]   from his own experience and from the experience of others, that Christian people often had
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.400]   to endure very severe and very sharp trials and tribulations.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   And there were those who were always ready to argue, as they're still ready to argue,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   that the fact that Christian people should be allowed to undergo such trials brings into
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.640]   question the whole of salvation.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.480]   And therefore it is very essential that the apostle should deal with this, and he does
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   so.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.240]   Now, as we come to look at it, let us note this, that this is an extremely important
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   subject.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.040]   I'm more and more impressed by the amount of space and time and attention which is given
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.280]   in the New Testament Scriptures to this one particular problem.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.360]   It is really quite remarkable when you come to look for it.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.880]   There is no theme, I sometimes think, that is dealt with more frequently than just this
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   particular problem.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.600]   Now, our Lord himself began, if you remember, at the very end of his ministry, when he was
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.320]   giving a number of messages to his disciples and followers, this is one of the last things
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.960]   he ever said to them.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.280]   He said, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace; in the
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:22.360]   world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.320]   That's the last verse in the sixteenth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   Now there you see is our blessed Lord and Master, right at the very end.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   He turns to these men and he says, "In the world ye are going to have tribulations, but
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.360]   be of good cheer.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   You are going to meet them, but be of good cheer.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.320]   I have overcome the world."
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.280]   The apostle Paul, in exactly the same way you will find, warned his young converts,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.440]   his young followers, in almost exactly the same way, he reminded them, he said, "It
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   is through many tribulations that we must enter the kingdom of God."
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.840]   That's Acts 14, 22.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.960]   He was going on around to the churches with Barnabas and that's the thing he impressed
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   upon them.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.800]   He said, "Don't be surprised, because it is through many tribulations that we must
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.600]   enter the kingdom of God."
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   Very well.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.560]   Now then, here is our theme.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.920]   We can therefore lay down this proposition.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.440]   There is no more important and no more subtle test of our profession of the Christian faith
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.200]   and the Christian life than just this one, the way we react to the trials and the troubles
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.360]   and the tribulations of our lives in this world.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.680]   There is no test which is more thorough-going, more delicate, more sensitive than this particular
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   test.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   I have sometimes ventured to describe it as the acid test of a man's profession of the
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   Christian faith.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.080]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   It is in particular the way to differentiate between the Christian faith and the various
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.680]   cults.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.800]   The claim that we can make for this message is, for this way of life, is that it is a
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.640]   life that never fails us, never lets us down.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.480]   Now that cannot be said of any false teaching, whether it is a false religion or a false
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.920]   philosophy.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.800]   Indeed, these cults generally give themselves away at the very outset by promising far too
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.300]   much.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.200]   It is the cults that say, "Become a Christian and you will never have any more troubles.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.080]   You won't know yourself, you won't know the world, you will walk with a fresh and a bright
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.320]   step and you will never have any troubles again."
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   It is the cults that say that.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.520]   I have already quoted sufficient to show you that the New Testament never says that at
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   all.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.080]   It says, "In the world you shall have tribulations."
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.000]   Indeed I could make out a case for saying that the New Testament teaches that a man
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.120]   who is a Christian is more likely to have troubles than anybody else.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.720]   That will come later.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.880]   But the cults, you see, make these great claims.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.720]   And then in the moment of crisis, when you need them and their help most of all, they
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.040]   are unable to help you.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.100]   I don't want to stop with this.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.240]   It seems to me there is a wonderful illustration of all this in the Old Testament, which says
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   everything.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.920]   It is that great scene on Mount Carmel, which is described in the first book of Kings chapter
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:53.360]   18, where the solitary, lonely Elias stands alone, facing some 850 false prophets.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.240]   And there is the great challenge, you remember, which is right, Elijah's God or the gods
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   of these others, Bel and these other gods?
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.040]   There is the moment of crisis.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   And you remember the story, don't you?
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.840]   They were given the opportunity first.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   And they pleaded with their God.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.480]   They scarified their flesh.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   They cried.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   They prayed.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   They pleaded.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   Nothing happened.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   Neither a voice nor a sound had answered.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:29.680]   And there they are, utterly discomfited, disappointed and exposed in the agony of the real crisis.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.800]   Then Elijah, you remember, prays to his God.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.840]   And God answered by fire.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.960]   And Elijah's faith was vindicated.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:46.360]   I say that the way to test between the true and the false is, what happens in the hour
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   of crisis in the times of real need?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   A faith that does not help us when we need it most of all is not the Christian faith,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.240]   for this never fails.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.080]   But let me put it like this to be still more practical.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:14.400]   This is a very good way of testing between a true belief and some merely emotional or
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.800]   psychological experience.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   Now there are people who sometimes think that they've become Christians because they've
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   had some feeling, they've had some experience in a meeting.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   And it was marvelous, it was wonderful, so much so that they made us think for a while
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.280]   that we'd never been Christians at all.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.040]   They'd had some astonishing experience.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.840]   Yes, but we've seen the same people a short time afterwards when something has gone wrong
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.040]   or when there have been difficulties and trials.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.480]   And they've renounced it all.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.240]   They're unhappy and they're wretched.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   Why?
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.200]   Well, they never had a true belief.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.020]   They had an emotional experience.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.460]   They had perhaps a psychological experience.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.400]   There are such things.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.360]   And you see, they thought that now everything was going to be perfect.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.080]   And the moment a trial comes, they lose everything.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.720]   Salvation to them meant being happy, living on your feelings.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.020]   And of course, when things go wrong, you become unhappy and everything's gone.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:22.800]   So that the men who are resting on some feelings alone will very soon be exposed when the trials
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.560]   and the tribulations come.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.640]   They always put an end to a mere emotional or psychological experience.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:42.040]   Or, let me put it like this, trials and tribulations always differentiate between what we've so
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:48.120]   often described as believism or fideism and true faith.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:54.840]   Here again, you see, is a terrible danger that we must never forget, that people think
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.760]   that merely to subscribe to teaching means true faith.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.400]   True faith includes that, but it's more than that, as we've seen already many times in
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.160]   working out the doctrine of justification by faith.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.840]   It isn't a mere believism, I said.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.600]   And it's very important I should have said that, because trials and tribulations test
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.280]   mere believism.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.760]   For the man who's merely got this kind of believism, when the trials and the tribulation
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.040]   comes, is found to fail altogether.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.760]   He's got nothing to fall back upon.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.900]   Now listen to our Lord saying this.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.620]   He says it in the parable of the sower.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.640]   You remember that he says that some of his seed fell on stony ground.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   He sprang up very quickly, he said, but because it hadn't any depth or any root, it didn't
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   last.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.040]   And yet he says, hath not root in himself, but dureth for a while.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:04.600]   For when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.760]   You see, this is the sort of man who's got some troubles and problems in his life.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.840]   He's tried everything.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.360]   He comes to a Christian church.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.200]   He's told there, you've only got to believe this and accept it and everything's going
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   to be all right.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.240]   He says, I'll believe it.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.080]   He says, I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.280]   Very well, they say, you're saved, everything's all right.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.200]   But then he finds the trials and tribulations come.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.960]   And he says, but I thought that if I said I believed this, that I'd never get this kind
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   of trouble again.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:39.000]   As our Lord puts it, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   offended.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.560]   He says, I didn't think it was going to be like this.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.240]   Why does God allow this sort of thing to happen?
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.700]   I thought that once I believed, never again would I be in such a position.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:14:00.920]   So you see, that trials and tribulations and troubles do indeed constitute the most vital
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:08.400]   and thoroughgoing test of our Christian profession, of our profession of the Christian faith.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.440]   All right, let's leave that principle and go on to another.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.920]   What then is to be the Christian's reaction to these things when they come?
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:29.840]   Tribulations mean afflictions, pressures, stresses, difficulties, illnesses perhaps,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   persecutions.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.480]   They can take almost any form.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.720]   Now then, what is to be the reaction of the Christian to trials of every conceivable type
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.280]   and kind?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.160]   Well, we needn't say that it isn't that he just grumbles and complains or feels he is
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.200]   being dealt with harshly or queries his faith altogether and thus fails.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.480]   It isn't that.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Well what is it?
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.760]   Well it isn't in the second place that he merely puts up with them.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   To put up with them is better than to fail, but that isn't the Christian reaction.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.880]   The Christian, says the apostle, doesn't merely resign in a negative spirit to his
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.240]   tribulations.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.960]   And you know this is a tremendously important thing today.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.480]   Christianity is not stoicism.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.440]   That's stoicism.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:39.640]   Stoicism puts up with things, bears it, just manages not to give in with a tremendous effort
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.680]   of the will and of courage, gets on and goes through.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680]   That's stoicism.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.960]   Bearing it, putting up with it, not failing, not breaking down, that isn't the Christian's
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.820]   reaction.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:59.280]   And this is a tremendous pointless, because I've often pointed out that it seemed to
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.560]   me that in the last war, and indeed since the last war, there is no confusion that has
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:11.240]   been so common as the confusion between stoicism and Christianity.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.600]   The firm upper lip is not a description of the Christian.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.160]   A Christian is not merely a man who exercises courage.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   Well what is it?
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.920]   Well I say it isn't a passive resignation.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:30.280]   It's this, not only so, but we glory in tribulations.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.360]   The same word that we had at the end of verse 2, we've translated here, "rejoice in hope
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.400]   of the glory of God," which I told you meant we burst in it, we exult in it, we glory in
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.720]   it, and this is the Christian's reaction.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.920]   This is his response to these tribulations.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   He boasts and exults and glories in these things.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   Now, here again I must bring out a meaning which we may very well miss.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.400]   You notice how he puts it?
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.960]   And not only so, he says, but we glory in tribulations also.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.880]   Now that word "in" is most important.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.040]   He's not saying that we glory in spite of them.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.080]   People have often thought it means that, that though they are happening, we still go on
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.720]   glory, we glory in spite of.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.200]   No, no.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.000]   He doesn't mean either this, that we glory in the midst of them.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.360]   It does mean that, but it means more than that.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.840]   Now that's a very good thing, that we are able to glory in the midst of our tribulations.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.520]   But you see the apostle is going well beyond that.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.680]   He says, "we glory on account of them, because of them."
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.800]   That's the meaning of the word "in" here.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.960]   Not in spite of, not in the midst of, but on account of, because of.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.600]   We glory because of our tribulations.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.440]   Now then, the vital question before us is, how do we interpret this?
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:22.520]   Well, perhaps the best thing to do again is to consider this kind of teaching as we find
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:30.400]   it also elsewhere in the New Testament, because I want to show you that it is typical and
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.160]   characteristic New Testament teaching.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.800]   This isn't the apostle Paul happening to be in a good mood and being carried away by his
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   own eloquence.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   No, no.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.120]   It's the universal teaching of the New Testament.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.760]   Listen to the Lord Jesus Christ stating it in Matthew 5, 10-12.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:57.640]   "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   of heaven.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.040]   Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   evil against you falsely for my sake.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:16.880]   Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.920]   they the prophets which were before you."
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.400]   You see, our Lord is saying it in the midst of these things.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.240]   "Rejoice and be exceedingly glad."
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.320]   Nothing stronger than that.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.800]   Or listen to it again in Acts 5, verse 41.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:40.000]   Here are these disciples, the apostles, being persecuted, put in jail, and so on.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.880]   And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.400]   worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.360]   Rejoicing that they had been put into prison.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.560]   Rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.360]   Listen to Paul saying it to the Corinthians.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:12.120]   "Our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.600]   weight of glory."
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.840]   That is exaltation.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   Again you get him saying it, you remember, in the second epistle to the Corinthians in
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:29.520]   that great twelfth chapter, verses 9 and 10, and so on.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.320]   Here he is with his thorn in the flesh.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.120]   Three times he prays that it may go.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.440]   The answer comes back, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440]   in weakness."
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.840]   Very well, says Paul.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:49.900]   "Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.800]   may rest upon me.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.720]   Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.960]   in distresses for Christ's sake.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.760]   For when I am weak, then am I strong."
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:13.360]   Yes, he says to the Philippians, "Unto you it is given on the behalf of Christ, not only
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.080]   to believe in him, but also to suffer for his name's sake.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.400]   It is given unto you.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.800]   It is something for you to glory in, therefore."
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Or take James.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.360]   They are all unanimous about this.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.240]   There is no contradiction.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.480]   Let it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into diverse temptations.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:40.800]   James 1 verse 2, or again in the twelfth verse of that same chapter, he says, "Blessed is
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.480]   the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   life."
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:56.040]   And then I read to you from the first epistle of Peter, chapter 4, in these verses 12 to
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   14.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:05.480]   "Count it not strange," he says, "concerning this fiery trial, but rejoice inasmuch as
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:11.680]   ye are partakers of Christ's suffering, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.280]   glad also with exceeding joy.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you."
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.480]   Well, there it seems to me is sufficient evidence for you.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.200]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.520]   The Christian's reaction is not merely to put up with it.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.360]   It is not to be happy in spite of it.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   It is not to be happy in the midst of it.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.200]   It is to rejoice on account of it, because of it.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   How does it work out?
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   Well, let's put it in this form.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:54.280]   It does not mean, of course, that we should actually be glad when these things happen
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   to us.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.440]   It does not mean that the moment these things happen to us, we begin to praise and to thank
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.820]   God thoughtlessly—not at all—or automatically, still less.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.600]   It does not mean that.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.040]   You notice how the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in the twelfth chapter puts it
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:24.080]   when he says, "No, none of these chastisements or trials for the present seemeth to be pleasurable."
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.200]   When a Christian is taken ill or when things go wrong with him, of course he immediately
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.680]   does not like these things.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.080]   The Christian is not meant to be unnatural.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.440]   He is not a pervert.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.060]   The apostle is not teaching a kind of masochism at this point.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.320]   That is not what we have got here.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.680]   There are people, there have been people in the Church who have thought that.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.200]   They have only been happy when they have been miserable, in a sense.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.800]   And they have thought that it was their business always to have things going wrong, and they
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.320]   have been miserable when things have not been going wrong.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.160]   They have courted trials.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.320]   That is not the teaching at all.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.760]   Oh, no.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:06.920]   Immediately and at first, these things are not pleasant, and nobody likes them, and nobody
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.840]   should like them.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.520]   The apostle does not say that we should like these things.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.640]   What he says is that we should glory in them, which is a very different thing.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.800]   "Well, then how does that work out?"
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   you say.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.400]   Well, like this.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:35.000]   We can glory in tribulations because our faith enables us to view them in such a way as to
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.440]   realize that tribulations, far from being adverse to our hope, actually promote it and
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.120]   indeed further it.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.360]   In other words, you see, the reaction of the Christian to tribulations is not an automatic
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   one.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.320]   They come and he rejoices.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.880]   Not at all.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:06.840]   He is a man who is enabled to glory in them as the result of the application of his faith.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.080]   Because he is a man of faith, he is able to do certain things.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:16.160]   They come and at first he is troubled, he is made unhappy, but then he does not stop
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.840]   it, that he proceeds now to deal with them.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   How?
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.000]   Well, the apostle gives us the answer.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.560]   Not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.840]   How?
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840]   By knowing.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.680]   It is because of something we know.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.400]   And you see, it is this knowledge and the application of the knowledge that enables
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.880]   us to exalt and to glory and to rejoice.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   What is this knowledge we have?
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:55.240]   Well, it is a knowledge and an insight into God's methods with respect to us.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:04.200]   Or, if you like, what our faith does is to enable us to follow the argument that the
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.240]   apostle now works out.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.680]   And this is the test of our faith this evening.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   Are we able to follow this reasoning, this argument, this thing that the apostle works
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   out here?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   Now, this is what he says.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:30.600]   He says we are enabled to rejoice in these things and to glory and to boast of them because
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.800]   we know.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.240]   And what we know is this, that tribulation worketh patience.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:47.200]   Now, that is the word, the word worketh.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.600]   It is a word that he is very fond of.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.520]   Did you notice it there in 2 Corinthians 4.17?
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.480]   Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   Same thing.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.840]   It is a wonderful process, this.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.960]   He says tribulation worketh patience.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   What does he mean by worketh?
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.520]   Well, he means works it out, works it out in detail from step to step, produces it,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.640]   brings it into being.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.240]   What is patience?
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.120]   Patience means constancy.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:28.120]   Patience means the ability to go on patiently enduring.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.860]   It means, if you like, steadfastness.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:43.480]   And what the apostle says is the tribulations produce, work this kind of endurance, this
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.720]   patient continuing.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.000]   How do they do that?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.280]   Well, I think we can all draw on our experiences and see exactly how it happens.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.560]   It happens like this, doesn't it?
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:08.120]   The moment these trials and tribulations come, we realize a new and a fresh need of him.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.920]   We have been going on in the Christian life.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   We thought we knew everything.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.600]   We thought we had got everything.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.200]   But suddenly we are confronted by these trials and tribulations and problems.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.080]   And at first we are taken aback.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.560]   We don't understand.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.080]   Ah, but if we have got true faith in us, these things will make us go back to him.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.840]   That's the test, you see.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.080]   We won't just look at them.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.760]   We will say, now then, we know what he has promised, so we go to him about this.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.040]   The man who hasn't got the real thing says, ah, it was all wrong, there was nothing in
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.280]   it, gives it up, goes out, goes back.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.120]   Not the Christian.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:58.100]   The fresh need makes him realize that he needs a fresh supply.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.840]   In other words, the trials and the tribulations make him think of the Lord Jesus Christ again,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.520]   whom he is always liable to forget.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   They do more.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.760]   They send them back to him.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.960]   They make them pray to him.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.400]   They make them spend more of their time with him.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.640]   They make them plead with him and ask him for greater strength and greater gifts.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.400]   So see that once they are doing something which is very good for him, they are driving
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.320]   him back to him.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.240]   Now they don't drive the men of the world to him.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.800]   They drive the men of the world away from him.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:35.880]   But if the man has got the faith in him, they will always drive him back to Christ himself.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.920]   But not only that, here is something else.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:49.040]   Trials and tribulations are very good for us in that they help us to know ourselves
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.080]   better than we knew ourselves before.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.920]   We are always overestimating ourselves.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.320]   We always think things are better with us than they are.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   That is why we always need to be exhorted to self-examination.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.920]   We are all on good terms with ourselves and we balance things up very cleverly.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.000]   And it is only sometimes when a trial or a tribulation comes that we are enabled to see
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.320]   where we are and how we perhaps have been drifting away.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   So they are very good, you see, in that they bring us not only to a better knowledge of
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.840]   him but a better knowledge of ourselves.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   We thought we could stand, we find we are shaking.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.840]   We thought we had faith that could meet anything, and here we are, badly shaken by something
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.480]   comparatively small.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.640]   It is a very good thing for us that, you see, it gives us a true conceit of ourselves and
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.040]   we realize that we are not as strong as we thought.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:59.000]   It drives us back, I say, to a sense of dependence upon him, and therefore the result is that
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.960]   we have a much better conception of the Christian life than we had before.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.360]   It was superficial before; it is now much deeper.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.960]   We realize our weakness, the strength of the enemy, his strength.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.140]   So we have a more balanced view, a deeper view, a larger view, and a truer view.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.400]   And the result is that when further trials come we are not flustered and excited, we
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.680]   are steadier.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.240]   Tribulation worketh patience.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.560]   We do not get excited when they come again.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.880]   We have had this experience and we now have got a true picture of the Christian life.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.400]   It is no longer that they all lived happily ever afterwards.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   No, no.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.240]   In the world we shall have tribulations and we are steady.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   Tribulation worketh patience.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.440]   Ah, but it does not stop there.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.880]   And patience, he says, experience.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.720]   Now unfortunately, this is not a very good translation here.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:03.480]   In a sense it is right, but it does not really bring out the better meaning.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:12.040]   Experience here means proof, trial, approvedness.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.720]   If you like, it means this, experience as the result of an experiment.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.440]   The experience that is the consequence of a trial or an experiment, that is it.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.320]   It is a proof.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.360]   A trial, it is an approvedness.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:40.160]   In other words, what the apostle is saying here is this, that this patient continuance
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:49.520]   leads to a proof that we really are truly Christian and that we have been able to pass
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   the test.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.320]   Now you see, our Lord brings all that out as I have shown you in the parable of the
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   sower.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:04.880]   Here a seed sown springs up, marvellous joy, persecution comes, fall away.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.320]   All the cares and the affairs of this world choke the word.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.720]   It seems to be, it is not true, it does not last, it disappears.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.280]   These are the things that test where we really are.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.680]   Now that is what we are being told here by the apostle.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.640]   This patient endurance, he says, is a wonderful test.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.400]   And the man who comes through the test is giving proof that he is all right.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.880]   Now James, you see, really says all that very perfectly in his way of putting it.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.080]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.920]   My brethren, he says in verse 2 of the first chapter, "Count it all joy when ye fall
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.040]   into diverse temptations, knowing this, knowing, you see, the same word, that the trying of
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.520]   your faith worketh patience."
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:56.840]   Yes, the trying of your faith, the testing of your faith works patience, the same words
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.160]   exactly.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.000]   And again in verse 12 he says it once more.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:11.440]   Here it is, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried, when he
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:19.240]   has been tried or tested, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord hath promised
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.720]   to them that love him."
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.500]   You see, it is trial.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.280]   What the patience does is to try and to test our faith.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.760]   But listen to Peter saying it.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:38.120]   Here is Peter in the first epistle, first chapter, verses 6 and 7.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:45.800]   He says, "Wherein in the salvation ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:53.360]   be, ye are in heaviness, through manifold temptations, that, in order that, the trial
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.160]   of your faith, the trial, the testing of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:06.040]   that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.240]   at the appearing of Jesus Christ."
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:17.640]   So that this patient endurance works out a testing and a trial in order that we may be
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:25.120]   approved as really being true Christians, true believers, real children of God.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   Well how does it work out?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.040]   Well, isn't it like this?
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.640]   The very fact that God is trying us ought to be to us a proof in and of itself that
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   we are God's children.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.240]   That is the whole argument of Hebrews 12, isn't it?
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.000]   So that you see, the Christian in a sense ought to rejoice when he is tried.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.200]   There is nothing more terrible for the Christian than never to have any trials.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.120]   "Woe is unto you," said Christ, "when all men speak well of you."
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.440]   Do you know, my friends, I say this to the glory of God, I am rather glad that certain
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:04.240]   modernistic liberal theologians say some rather unkind and unpleasant things about me.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.120]   It is to me a proof of my faith.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.640]   I should be rather unhappy if they praised me.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.080]   It is a terrible thing when you are being praised by everybody.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.040]   There are certain preachers, they are praised by evangelicals, praised by modernists.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Everybody is praising them.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.640]   I thank God I am not in that position.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.920]   "Woe is unto you when all men speak well of you."
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.440]   You see, it is a proof of the fact that I am in the faith.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.160]   So the trials are good in and of themselves.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.640]   They give me an impression that God is interested in me.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.240]   "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, he scourgeth every son whom he calleth."
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.880]   If you are not, you are bastards, you are not sons.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.760]   You see how terribly wrong it is to picture the Christian life as something which says
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.280]   you will never have any trials anymore.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.920]   It is the exact opposite.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.760]   The Christian who is not experiencing some kind of trial or chastisement had better seriously
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.840]   examine himself again.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:09.960]   Therefore I say they work out like that, but they work out also like this.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:15.560]   Trials and tribulations not only bring out God's love to me, but they are a very good
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.520]   test of my love to God.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:25.520]   If I only love God when everything is going well, I am not in the right position.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:32.640]   It is a man who can say, "With your being, though he slay me," yet that is the thing.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.040]   When you are down, as it were, and everything against you, and the devil says to you, "Where
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.360]   is your God and where is the love of God?"
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.480]   You can turn to him and say, "Get thee behind me, Satan.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.320]   You do not understand.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.640]   This is his method of perfecting me and of bringing me to glory.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.640]   I need it.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.440]   There are these angles and corners.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.240]   They need to be rubbed off.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.120]   There is so much impurity in me.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.320]   I have not responded to his gospel.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.480]   He is doing it for my good.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.040]   My earthly parents have chastised me and have punished me to satisfy themselves because
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.160]   they love me.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:14.360]   How much more does the Father of Spirits do this for those who belong to him?"
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:21.160]   And so I can say that even in the midst of these things, my love of God becomes greater
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.280]   than ever.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   You see, I can see now that he is so concerned about me, that he loves me so much that he
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.880]   wants me to be perfect.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   "Your faith," says Peter, "indeed is much more precious than gold."
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.600]   How do you purify gold?
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.320]   By putting it in a furnace, isn't it?
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:48.080]   It is the fire that burns away the alloy, all that is impure and unmixed, all that is
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.160]   burnt away.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:55.080]   So you put this mess of metal there in the crucible and everything that is dross is burnt
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.560]   away and you are left with nothing but the pure gold.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.640]   That is what tribulations and trials do to us.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.000]   They test us, they prove us, they get rid of everything in us except that which is true,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.080]   this real faith, this genuine thing, and everything else is gone.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.920]   But this comes out brighter and more glorious than before.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:25.720]   Or, if I may use a modern illustration, the scientists have to test their steel before
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.000]   they put it into an aeroplane or into a bridge.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.820]   Can it stand the stress?
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.200]   Can it stand up to these atmospheric pressures when you go up to certain heights?
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.680]   They test it to see if it will stand.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.120]   That is what tribulations do.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.480]   And after they have passed the test, well, you know that it is better than you ever knew
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   before.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.280]   It comes out more wonderful.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.840]   Tribulation worketh patience and patience worketh testing.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.240]   Proof makes us a proof.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   We know that God loves us and we have had a proof of our true love to God.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:10.720]   And that in turn leads to hope once more and experience or proving or testing hope.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   What is this hope?
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.800]   The hope that he talked about in chapter, in verse 2, "And rejoice in hope of the glory
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   of God."
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.280]   He starts with hope, he ends with hope.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   What has been happening?
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.920]   Well, you see, it works out like this.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:34.000]   It is, I say, nothing but that great argument of Hebrews 12.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.980]   We started with this hope because of justification by faith.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:45.600]   We did indeed rejoice or glory in hope of the glory of God.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.520]   Ah, we see it.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.400]   Then these things come and they seem to be leading all away from it, but they do not.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.720]   They bring us back to it.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.400]   And they not only bring us back to it, they make us much more certain of it than we were
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.480]   at the beginning.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.360]   Having gone through all this, we are much more certain that we belong to God.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.480]   You remember we saw that we rejoice in this hope of the glory of God because we are God's
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.680]   children and because he started the process.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.760]   Yes, but having passed through the furnace of affliction, through the trials and the
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.640]   tribulations, I am much more certain of that than I was before.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.440]   So my hope is greater than it was at the beginning.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.680]   The same hope, but I am much more certain of it.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.880]   That is why we glory in these things.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:38.160]   They strengthen the hope, they make us more certain of the hope, and they do it in the
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.400]   way that I have been indicating to you.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.560]   God had already told me in his word that I am his child, his son in Christ, who bore
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.720]   my sins.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.840]   I believe that.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.200]   I have been given the assurance of that.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:03.000]   But now he has given me this further proof.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.320]   He is so concerned about me that he is perfecting me.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.920]   He is going on with me.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:20.360]   He takes a pride in me and he wants to bring me to that perfect image of his own dearly
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.240]   beloved son.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:31.600]   These things, by driving us back to the Lord Jesus Christ, by showing us God's love to
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:38.880]   us, by giving us fresh experiences of God's strength and grace and power, sufficient for
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.040]   every trial and for every need, we never knew it was so much.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.200]   We thought we did, but we really didn't.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:51.120]   There are turns and aspects and phases of it that we never even imagined for a moment,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.440]   but we have known them, we have experienced them, we are more certain of God than we ever
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.080]   were before.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.960]   Therefore we glory because of these tribulations, on account of them.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.600]   We thank God for them.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:10.360]   We say with the writer of the 119th Psalm, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.680]   I am better than I was before.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.960]   I am more certain of God.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.440]   I am more certain that I am his child.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.360]   I am more certain of his love.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.480]   I am more certain of the love of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:35.560]   Indeed, as a quaint expositor once put it, Christian hope is both the parent and the
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.840]   child of patience.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.240]   Did you get that?
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:48.880]   Christian hope is both the parent and the child of hope, at one and the same time, like
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.960]   this.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.840]   We start, you see, with the hope.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.520]   There is the parent.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:01.880]   And it is because we have got that hope that we are able to be patient in the endurance
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.480]   of the tribulations.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.280]   So the hope is the parent of the patience.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:15.760]   But, as I have been able to show you, the patience in turn leads to a yet firmer grasp
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.840]   of the hope.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:25.520]   So there is a sense in which the patience is also something that leads to the hope.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.000]   It is both parent and child.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.960]   In the first instance, the patience is the child of the original hope.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:42.000]   But in the second instance, it is the parent of this larger, deeper, bigger, more certain,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.280]   and more solid hope that we have.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:45:00.640]   Christian hope is therefore, at one and the same time, both the parent and the child of
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   patience.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.800]   Very well, we leave it at that for this evening.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:15.440]   And there we have seen how the Apostle shows us how it is that we are enabled to glory
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:26.280]   in tribulations, because we know that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.640]   and experience hope.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.520]   Let us pray.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.440]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
