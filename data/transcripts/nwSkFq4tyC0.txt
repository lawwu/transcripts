[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.440]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.440]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.620]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.920]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.660]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720]   Along those lines, I want to thank the sponsors
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.280]   of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.320]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.900]   which is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.080]   probiotic liquid supplement.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.540]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.080]   because I really like getting
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200]   my total vitamin mineral base covered
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   in one easy-to-consume product.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   It also tastes really good.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.480]   I've mixed mine with a little bit of lemon juice.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.640]   I've been doing that well for well over a decade now.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.140]   And the inclusion of probiotics is important to me
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.000]   because there's a lot of data out there right now
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500]   about the importance of gut health
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.940]   for the immune system, for mood.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.900]   And so by combining all these things in one product,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.580]   I get all those things at once.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.460]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.540]   and that will give you a special offer
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.260]   where you will get a year's supply
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.180]   of liquid vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.300]   Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.260]   for various aspects of immune function,
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.340]   as well as other biological functions.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.700]   And so once more, if you want to try Athletic Greens
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.400]   and get the year's supply of vitamin D3, K2,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.260]   just go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.580]   The other sponsor of today's podcast is Inside Tracker.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.580]   Inside Tracker is a way to measure metabolic factors,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.580]   hormones, and DNA-related factors by way of blood tests
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.900]   and saliva in order to assess one's health.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.940]   I'm a big believer in blood tests and saliva tests
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.920]   for assessing one's health markers because I like data.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.100]   And there's really no other way to measure what's going on
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.940]   in one's body without taking the occasional blood test
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.260]   or saliva test.
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.220]   You can guess what's going on,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.940]   but if you really want to know what's going on
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.660]   under the hood, Inside Tracker can be of great help.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.300]   One of the problems with a lot of products out there,
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.660]   or just regular blood testing,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.180]   is that you get a lot of data back
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.480]   about the levels of various hormones, metabolic factors,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.900]   et cetera, but you don't know what to do with those data.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.660]   Great thing about Inside Tracker is it is provided
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.300]   in a format, they have an online dashboard,
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.020]   that given your particular levels of various things,
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.340]   directs you toward potential lifestyle-related changes
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.180]   like changes in exercise or changes in sleep patterns
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.600]   or changes in nutritional patterns
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.860]   that can really help move those markers and those numbers
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.100]   on those metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.960]   in the direction that you want.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.540]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.700]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.740]   And if you do that,
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.700]   you'll get 25% off their program at checkout.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.620]   Okay, let's get started.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680]   Today is episode three of the podcast,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.420]   and it is office hours.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.620]   Office hours, as many of you know,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.380]   is where students come to the office of the professor,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.680]   sit down and ask questions, requesting clarification
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.640]   about things that were confusing,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840]   or to simply go down the route of exploring a topic
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200]   with more depth and detail.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.760]   I asked for your questions to be listed
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.060]   in the comment section of the previous two episodes
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.140]   of the podcast on YouTube, as well as on Instagram.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.020]   And I, first of all, just want to thank you
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.260]   for the many questions.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.780]   They are excellent.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.160]   We read them all.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.200]   We distilled from that large batch of questions
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.460]   to two types of questions,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.380]   questions that were asked very often
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.360]   and were liked very often with a little thumbs up like tab,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.660]   as well as questions that we thought could really expand
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.460]   on the topics that we've covered previously.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.520]   And today we're going to cover both of those.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.860]   If we did not get to your question, please don't despair.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.240]   We will keep track of those.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.580]   And we have several more episodes devoted to this topic
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.440]   of sleep and wakefulness and learning
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.340]   during the month of January, maybe even, you know,
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.380]   leaking over a little bit into the month of February.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.780]   So we have time.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.780]   That's one of the unique formats of this podcast
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.700]   is that we have time for dialogue.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.940]   We have time for your questions
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.460]   and we have time to really go deep into these topics.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.820]   It's official, Costello is sleeping in the background.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.140]   So if you hear snoring, Costello is going to be keeping time
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.380]   with his deep and melodic snoring.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.460]   There he goes.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.740]   So the questions that we received,
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.780]   I batched crudely into a couple of different categories.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.180]   Light, exercise, supplementation,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.300]   temperature, learning, plasticity, and mood,
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.140]   and sort of mood related disorders.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.940]   There were a lot of questions about those.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.600]   Before we begin any of this,
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.860]   I want to point out something that I always say,
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.460]   it sounds like boilerplate,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.300]   but it's important not just to protect me,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.340]   but to protect you, which is that I am not a physician.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.340]   I'm not a medical doctor.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.620]   I don't prescribe anything, including behavioral protocols.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.460]   I'm a professor.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.060]   I profess a lot of things based on quality peer-reviewed
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.660]   studies.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.060]   You should take that information.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.080]   You should filter it through whatever it is
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.620]   that you currently happen to be dealing with,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.180]   whether or not that's health or illness.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.900]   You should consult with a licensed healthcare professional
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.660]   before you add or remove anything
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.240]   from your daily life protocol.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.500]   I'm not responsible for your health, you are.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.600]   So be smart with this information
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.360]   and be a stringent filter, as we say.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.160]   Okay, very well.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.320]   Let's get started on the actual material.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.240]   Somebody asked, what is the role of moonlight and fire?
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.980]   I'm presuming they mean fireplace or candle
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.440]   or things of that sort.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.480]   In setting circadian rhythms,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.280]   is it okay to view moonlight at night
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.680]   or will that wake me up?
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.780]   Will a fire in my fireplace
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.860]   or using candlelight be too much light?
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.300]   Great question.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.900]   Also offers me the opportunity to share with you
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.280]   what I think is a quite beautiful definition
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.700]   of what light is in a quantitative sense.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.300]   So I've mentioned a few times the use of apps
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.880]   and light meters and things to measure things like lux,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.620]   which sometimes are also described in terms of candelas.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.560]   So those are the two units for measuring light intensity.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.940]   Typically lux, L-U-X, is the unit.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.700]   And so before we go forward and discuss this many lux
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.980]   or that many lux, I want to just tell you what a lux is
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.760]   because it relates to this question.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   One lux equals the illumination of one square meter surface
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.940]   at one meter away from a single candle.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.740]   So somebody actually decided at some point
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.260]   that the amount of illumination at one square meter surface,
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.800]   one meter away from a single candle, that equals one lux.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.000]   So when we talk about 6,000 lux of light intensity
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   or 10,000 lux of light intensity,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.120]   now you have a kind of a reference or a framework
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.680]   that would be the equivalent of,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.920]   you could think of it as 6,000 candles
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   all with their light intensity shown on one square meter
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.800]   from one meter's distance away.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.880]   Or of course, if it was a different number of lux,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.400]   it would be a different number of candles.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.800]   So you get the idea.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.680]   Here's the great thing.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.280]   It turns out that moonlight, candlelight,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.580]   and even a fireplace,
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.940]   if you have one of these roaring fires
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.680]   going in the fireplace,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.080]   do not reset your circadian clock at night
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.040]   and trick your brain into thinking that it's morning.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.980]   Even though if you've ever sat close to a fireplace
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.040]   or even a candle, that light seems very bright.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.860]   And there are two reasons for that that are very important.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.280]   The first one is that these neurons in your eye
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.040]   that I discussed in the previous episode,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.620]   these melanopsin ganglion cells,
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.920]   also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.940]   those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.280]   And those cells respond best to the blue-yellow contrast
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.820]   present in the rising and setting sun,
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.740]   so-called low solar angle sun,
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.960]   also discussed in the previous episode.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.400]   But those cells adjust their sensitivity
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   such that they will not activate the triggers in the brain
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.760]   that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.560]   even a full moon, a really bright moon,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.480]   or fire.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   Now, this does raise an interesting kind of thought point,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.960]   which is a lot of people have talked about lunacy
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.520]   and the fact that when there's a full moon out,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.000]   people act differently and behave differently.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.340]   There's a lot of lore around that.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.420]   There's actually a little bit of quality science around that
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.280]   that maybe we can address in the future.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   But moonlight is typically not going to wake us up too much,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.400]   except maybe if the moon is really full and really bright,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.980]   there's possibility for that.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.040]   So provided you're not going to burn down
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.060]   the structure you're in,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.320]   you're not going to burn down the forest,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.080]   enjoy your fireplaces, enjoy your lights from candles,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.560]   and those are perfectly safe
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   without disrupting your circadian rhythm.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.720]   Because we talked about just how crucial it is
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.760]   to avoid bright lights
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.720]   between the hours of about 10 PM and 4 AM,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.360]   except when you need to view things for sake of safety
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.480]   or work and so forth.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.560]   I also received a lot of questions about red light.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.220]   Now, I think I was asked those questions
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.760]   because red light is used
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.920]   in a number of different commercial products
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.200]   where these products tend to include
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.600]   a sheet of very bright red lights
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.440]   that one is supposed to view early in the day.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.320]   And there are various claims attached
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.080]   to these red light devices
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.920]   that they improve mitochondrial function,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.360]   that they improve metabolism.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.320]   I'm going to be really honest and I can't name brands
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.400]   and I'm not going to name particular studies
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.180]   'cause what I'm about to say about these studies
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.520]   is not particularly unkind,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.560]   but let's just say that none of the studies that I've seen,
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.700]   except for one that I'll talk about in a moment,
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.320]   pointing to the positive effects of red light
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.720]   on the visual system
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.800]   are published in blue ribbon journals.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.220]   They tend to be published in journals
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.920]   that I had to work hard to find.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.120]   I'm not sure what the peer review and stringency level is.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.000]   Now, that's not to say red light isn't beneficial
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.320]   because there is one study in particular
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.800]   that came from Glen Jeffrey's lab
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.160]   at the University of College London.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.200]   It was published last year.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.920]   Glen is somebody I happen to know.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.600]   He has an excellent reputation, excellent vision scientist.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.380]   What this study essentially showed,
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.760]   and again, this is a study that I very much like the data
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.160]   and think it was done with very high standards.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.680]   What this study shows is that viewing red light
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.080]   for a few minutes each morning
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.160]   can have positive effects on mitochondria
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.140]   in a particular retinal cell type
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.840]   that tends to degenerate or decline in function
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.160]   with age in humans.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.920]   And that cell type is the photoreceptor.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.360]   The photoreceptor is a type of cell in your eye
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.000]   that sits at the back of the eye.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.560]   It's kind of some distance away from the ganglion cells.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.980]   And it's the cell that converts light information
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.520]   into electrical signals that the rest of the retina
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.360]   and brain can understand.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.140]   These are vitally important cells.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.160]   Without them, people are blind.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.720]   And many people's vision gets worse with age,
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.740]   in particular age-related macular degeneration,
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.240]   but also related to some other factors,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.480]   including photoreceptor functionality,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.720]   just getting worse with time.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.560]   And what Glenn showed was that red light flashes delivered,
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.360]   in particular early in the day, but not late in the day,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.560]   can help repair the mitochondria.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.860]   Now, this study needs more support
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.780]   from additional studies, of course.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.040]   They are doing a clinical trial.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.000]   They did report on what I think it was 12 patients.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.700]   And so the work is ongoing, but that was very interesting.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.080]   And it points to some potentially
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.480]   really useful things about red light.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.640]   However, most of the questions I got about red light
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.100]   for sake of office hours
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.500]   were about the use of red light later in the day.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.340]   So here's the deal.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.840]   In principle, red light will not stimulate the melanopsin
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.200]   retinal neurons that wake up the brain and circadian clock
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.000]   and signal daytime.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.480]   However, most of the red lights,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.640]   in particular the red lights that come on these sheets
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.360]   of these products that people are supposed to view them
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.700]   in order to access a number of proclaimed health effects,
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.380]   those are way too bright
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.380]   and would definitely wake up your body and brain.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.240]   So if you're going to use those products,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.260]   and I'm not suggesting you do or you don't,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.640]   but if that's your thing,
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.180]   you would want to use those early in the day.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.020]   Who knows, you might even derive some benefit
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.140]   on mitochondrial function in these photoreceptors.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.220]   But if you're thinking about red light
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.060]   for sake of avoiding the negative effects of light
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.040]   later in the day and at night,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.420]   then you want that red light to be very, very dim,
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.940]   certainly much dimmer than is on most
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.120]   of those commercial products.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.640]   Now, do you need red lights?
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.580]   No, although red lights are rather convenient
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.820]   because you can see pretty well with them on,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.740]   but if they're dim, they won't wake up the circadian clock.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.320]   They won't have this dopamine disrupting thing
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.140]   that we talked about in the previous podcast.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.900]   So there's a role for red light potentially early in the day
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.660]   and for mitochondrial repair in the photoreceptors.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.900]   There's a role for dim red light
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.540]   later in the day and at night.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.020]   So you're starting to notice a theme here,
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.740]   which is that there's no immediate prescription
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.080]   of look at these lights.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.260]   It's look at these lights potentially,
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.600]   if that's what you want to do,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.380]   at particular times of day and with particular intensities.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.000]   It brings us back to the blue light issue,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.340]   which is so many people are obsessed
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.560]   with avoiding blue light,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.960]   but you actually want a ton of blue light
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.320]   early in the day and throughout the day.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.160]   So don't wear your blue blockers then,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.500]   or maybe even don't wear them at all.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.640]   And at night, it doesn't matter
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.120]   if you have blue blockers on.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.920]   If the lights are bright enough,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.000]   then you're still going to be activating
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.740]   these cells and mechanisms.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.580]   I just want to add something about the science
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.540]   behind the blue blocker confusion.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.260]   So these melanopsin retinal cells do react to blue light.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.340]   That is the best stimulus for one of these melanopsin cells,
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.520]   which led to the belief that blue blockers
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.500]   would be a good thing for preventing resetting
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.900]   of the circadian clock at night
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.000]   and deleterious effects of screens, et cetera.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.180]   However, the people that made these products
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.320]   failed to actually read the papers start to finish,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.080]   or if they did, they didn't comprehend a critical element,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.900]   which is that most of those papers early on
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.400]   took those neurons out and put them in a dish.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.540]   And when they did that, they divorced those neurons
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.640]   from their natural connections in the eye.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.380]   Turns out in your eye and my eye right now,
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.980]   because that's what we care about, these cells exist.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.260]   And these cells respond to blue light,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.280]   but also to other wavelengths of light
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.840]   because they not only respond directly to light
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.020]   as they do in a dish,
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.360]   they also respond to input from photoreceptors.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.460]   So if you talk to anyone in the circadian biology field,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.280]   they'll tell you, oh yeah, this blue light thing
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.540]   has really gotten out of control
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.900]   because people assume that blue light is the culprit
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.620]   because blue light is the best stimulus.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.080]   That doesn't mean that blue light is the only stimulus
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.920]   that will trigger these cells, okay?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.200]   So like many things, a scientific paper can be accurate
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.460]   without being exhaustive.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.660]   And a lot of claims about products can be accurate,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.500]   but not exhaustive.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.540]   So blue light during the day is great.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.860]   Get that screen light, get that sunlight especially,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.680]   get overhead lights.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.020]   I talk about all this in the previous podcast.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.020]   But at night, you really want to avoid those bright lights
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.120]   and it doesn't matter if it's blue light or something else.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.280]   And so there was a real confusion about the papers
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.780]   and the data when most of those product recommendations
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.620]   were made.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.620]   Okay, while we're on that topic,
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.000]   let's talk about light in other orifices of the body.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.020]   I made a kind of a joke about this the last podcast episode,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.740]   but a couple of people wrote to me and said,
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.660]   "Well, I've seen some claims that light delivered
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.920]   "to the ears, into the ears or the roof of the mouth
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.660]   "or up the nose can be beneficial
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.980]   "for setting circadian rhythms."
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.740]   No, not directly anyway.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.080]   And this is a great opportunity for us to distinguish
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.160]   between what is commonly called the placebo effect,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.980]   but a more important way to think about any manipulation,
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.240]   behavioral or otherwise that you might do
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.180]   is the difference between modulation and mediation.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.940]   There are a lot of things that will modulate your biology.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.800]   Putting a couple of lights up your nose,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.560]   please don't do this, might modulate your biology
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   by way of the stress hormone that's released
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.820]   when you stuff those things up your nose.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.260]   Remember earlier, previous podcasts,
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.260]   I said that virtually anything will phase shift
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260]   your circadian rhythm if it's different and dramatic enough.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.720]   So the question is, is it the light delivered up the nose
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.920]   or through the ears or some other orifice
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.860]   that's mediating the process?
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   Is it actually tapping into the natural biology
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.660]   of the system that you're trying to manipulate?
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.920]   And this is where I like to distinguish
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.200]   between real biology and hacks.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.580]   I don't like the word hack or frankly neuro-hacking
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.020]   or bio-hacking, I just don't like the term
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.760]   because a hack is using something for a purpose
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   for which it was not intended, right?
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.380]   But where you can kind of, it's a kind of a cheat
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.620]   and that's not how biology works well.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.460]   So I try and distinguish between things
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.580]   that really mediate biological processes
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.500]   and things that modulate them.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   There are a number of commercial products out there
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.380]   with some studies attached to them claiming
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.660]   that light delivered to the ears or wherever
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.740]   can adjust your wakefulness or adjust your sleep.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.820]   I've looked at those papers again,
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.420]   I'm probably going to lose some friends by saying this
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.380]   but maybe I'll gain a few as well.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.360]   Not blue ribbon journals, frankly.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.500]   Oftentimes read the small print,
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.320]   there was a conflict of interest clause there
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.160]   related to commercial interests.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.000]   If somebody disagrees with me outright on this
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.360]   and can send to me a peer reviewed paper
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.920]   published in a quality journal about light delivered
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.200]   anywhere but the eyes of humans
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.700]   that can mediate circadian rhythms, wakefulness, et cetera,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.400]   I'm more than happy to take a look at that
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.560]   and change my words and stance on this
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.420]   and do it publicly, of course.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.980]   But until then, I'm guessing that the proper controls
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.240]   were not done of adjusting for heat that could be delivered
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.820]   which can definitely shift circadian rhythms.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.940]   We're going to talk about temperature
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.140]   and other things like that.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.120]   So light to the eyes folks is where these light effects
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.020]   work in humans, in other animals
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.740]   they have extraocular photoreception in humans, no.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.660]   And just be mindful.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.880]   I mean, I'm not trying to encourage people
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.220]   to avoid certain products in particular
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.840]   but just be mindful of this difference
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.560]   between modulation and mediation.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.440]   And mediating a process through a hardwired
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.360]   or longstanding biological mechanism
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.440]   is really where you're going to see
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.200]   the powerful effects over time.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.800]   I also, as you've probably noticed,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.960]   I really tend to favor behavioral tools
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.840]   and zero cost tools first
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   and getting those dialed in before you start, you know,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.040]   plugging in and swallowing
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.000]   and, you know, putting things in various places
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.140]   just to really figure out how your biology works
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.020]   and explore that unless there's of course
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.540]   a clinical need to take a prescribed drug
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.180]   in which case by all means, listen to your doctor.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.460]   Okay, a huge number of people asked me about
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.680]   what about light through windows?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.160]   And I actually did an Instagram post about this.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.840]   Look, setting your circadian clock
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.560]   with sunlight coming through a window
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.720]   is going to take 50 to 100 times longer.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.520]   If you want the date on that,
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.920]   I'd be happy to send you to the various papers
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.800]   that were described in the previous podcast
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.360]   that Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford and I
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.240]   have discussed also elsewhere.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.600]   But here's really the key thing with this.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.620]   Do the experiment.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.200]   You can download the free app Light Meter.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.660]   You can have a bright day outside or some sunlight.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.440]   Hold up that app, take a picture.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.020]   It'll tell you how many lux, now you know what lux are.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.120]   It will tell you how many lux are in that environment.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.580]   Now close the window.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.600]   And if you want, close the screen or don't open the screen.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.680]   You can do all sorts of experiments
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.360]   and you'll see that it will at least half the amount of lux.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.760]   And it doesn't scale linearly,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.320]   meaning let's say I get a 10,000 lux outside,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.400]   5,000 looking out through an open window
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.240]   and then I close the window and it's 2,500 lux.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.840]   It does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.480]   for twice as long if it's half as many lux, okay?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.960]   It's not like 2,500 lux means you need to look
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   for 10 minutes and 5,000 lux means
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.040]   you look for five minutes.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.640]   It doesn't scale that way
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.000]   just because the biology doesn't work that way.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.440]   Best thing to do is to get outside if you can.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.940]   If you can't, next best thing to do
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.560]   is to keep that window open.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.120]   It is perfectly fine to wear prescription lenses
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.560]   and contacts.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.000]   Why is it okay to wear prescription lenses and contacts
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.840]   when those are glass also,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.860]   but looking through a window diminishes the effect?
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.540]   Well, we should think about this.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.800]   The lenses that you wear in front of your eyes
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.720]   by prescription or on your eyes are designed
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.440]   to focus the light onto your neural retina.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.700]   In fact, that's what nearsightedness is,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.720]   is when the image,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.120]   because your lens doesn't work quite right,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.300]   the image falls in front of the neural retina,
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.040]   wearing a particular lens in front of that
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.360]   focuses the lens onto your retina, onto these very neurons
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.960]   so they can communicate that to the brain.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   Costello is loving this, he's deep in sleep.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.060]   And if we, maybe we could play him some tones
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.980]   and he'll remember it later based on the studies
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.880]   we're going to talk about in a little bit.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   I don't know how we'd know if he remembered it or not,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.340]   but prescription lenses are fine.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.880]   In fact, they're great for this reason,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.940]   they're actually focusing the light onto the retina.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.960]   So think about this logically
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.520]   and all of a sudden it makes perfect sense.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.120]   Your glass window or your windshield
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.240]   or the side window of your car,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.000]   it isn't optically perfect to bring the image
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.520]   and the light onto your retina.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.180]   In fact, what it's doing is it's scattering
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.120]   and filtering light,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.440]   in particular the wavelengths of light that you want.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.880]   So if you live in a low light environment,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.060]   lots of questions about this,
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.760]   we talked about this the previous podcast,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   but just get outside for longer
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.840]   or, and or use really bright lights inside.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.360]   Okay, so let's think about why
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.100]   I'm making some of these recommendations
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.520]   because I think it can really empower you
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.800]   with the ability to change your behavior
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.500]   in terms of light viewing and other things,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.240]   depending on time of year,
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.040]   depending on other lifestyle factors.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.240]   The important point to understand
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.920]   is that early in the day,
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.800]   your central circadian clocks
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.200]   and all these mechanisms are looking for a lot of light.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.520]   I mean, they don't have a mind of their own,
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.280]   but it needs a lot of light
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.240]   to trigger this daytime signal alertness, et cetera.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   And early in the day, but not in the middle of the day,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.920]   you can sum or add photons.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.200]   So there's this brief period of time early in the day
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.240]   when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.480]   when your brain and body are expecting
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.300]   a morning wake-up signal,
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.520]   where let's say it's not that bright outside.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.120]   Someone sent me a picture
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.700]   or a little movie of their walk in England
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.960]   and it was pretty overcast
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.040]   and they were using light meter
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   and they said it's only about 700 lux or maybe even less.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.560]   And I said, well, stay outside longer,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.860]   but when you get inside,
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.160]   turn on the lights really bright
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.920]   and overhead lights in particular
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.800]   because those will be best for stimulating these mechanisms.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.060]   And that's because at least
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.520]   for the first few hours of the day,
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.800]   you can continue to sum or add photon activation
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.340]   of these cells in the eye and the brain.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.380]   In the middle of the day, once the sun is overhead,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.300]   or even if you stay inside all morning,
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.000]   and then you're in the circadian dead zone,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.280]   which sounds terrible.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   And it is terrible because it doesn't matter
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.120]   if you get a ton of artificial light or even sunlight,
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.520]   you're not going to shift your circadian clock.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.960]   You're not going to get that wake-up signal.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.820]   And then in the evening,
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.520]   you want to think about this whole system
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.280]   as being vulnerable to even a few photons of light
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   because your sensitivity to light really goes up at night.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.480]   And I talked last time about how you can protect
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.200]   against that sensitivity by looking at the setting sun
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.220]   and watching the evening sun,
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.840]   even if it's not crossing the horizon
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.320]   around the time of sunset.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.920]   And that's because it adjusts your retinal sensitivity
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.120]   and your melatonin pathway
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   so that light is not as detrimental to melatonin at night.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.480]   Think about the afternoon sunlight viewing
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.760]   as kind of a,
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.360]   I think of it as kind of a Netflix inoculation.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.240]   It allows me to watch a little bit of Netflix
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.740]   in the evening.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.640]   Although it's very hard to watch
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.280]   a little bit of anything on Netflix.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.900]   It seems like there's some other neurobiological process
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.000]   that's going on there where I have to watch
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   episode after episode after episode.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.700]   But in any case, you can protect yourself
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.400]   against some of that bad effect of light at night
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.700]   by looking at light in the evening.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.120]   It really does adjust down the sensitivity of the system.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.480]   Okay, I want to talk about seasonal changes
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.820]   in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.720]   So depending on where you are in the world,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.300]   Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   at the equator or closer to the poles,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.680]   the days and nights are going to be different lengths.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.100]   That just makes sense.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.640]   But that translates to real biological signals
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.320]   that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep times,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.020]   but also mood and metabolism.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.700]   So here's how this works.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.920]   Now, after seeing the previous episode of the podcast
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.700]   and paying attention here,
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.480]   you are armed with the knowledge to really understand
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.800]   how it is that believe it or not,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.320]   every cell in your body is tuned
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.820]   to the movement of the planet relative to the sun.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.340]   So as all of you know,
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.080]   the earth spins once every 24 hours on its axis.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.020]   So part of that day we're bathed in sunlight,
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.820]   depending on where we are the other half of the day
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.820]   or part of the day we're in darkness.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.960]   The earth also travels around the sun.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.380]   365 days is the time that it takes one year
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.840]   to travel around that sun.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.060]   The earth is tilted.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.100]   It's not perfectly upright.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.160]   So the earth is tilted on its axis.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.740]   So depending on where we are in that 365 day journey
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.620]   and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere,
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.740]   Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.220]   some days of the year are longer than others.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.140]   Some are very short, some are very long.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.020]   If you're at the equator,
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.060]   you experience less variation in day length
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.140]   and therefore night length.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.880]   And if you're closer to the poles,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.740]   you're going to experience some very long days.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.380]   And you're also going to experience some very short days
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.860]   depending on which pole you're at
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.540]   and what time of year it is.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.860]   The simple way to put this is depending on time of year,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.180]   the days are either getting shorter or getting longer.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.340]   Now, every cell in your body adjusts its biology
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.920]   according to day length,
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.140]   except your brain, body and cells
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.780]   don't actually know anything about day length.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.940]   It only knows night length.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.220]   And here's how it works.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.900]   Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.700]   If days are long and getting longer,
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.180]   that means melatonin is reduced.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.460]   The total amount of melatonin is less
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.080]   because light is more, therefore melatonin is less.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.400]   If days are getting shorter,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.460]   light can't inhibit melatonin as much
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.280]   through the summing of photon mechanisms
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.960]   that we talked about before.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.800]   And that melatonin signal is getting longer.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.300]   So every cell in your body
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.780]   actually knows external day length
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.720]   and therefore time of year
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.820]   by way of the duration of the melatonin signal.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.660]   And in general, it's fair to say that in diurnal animals,
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.820]   meaning animals like us
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.780]   that tend to be awake during the daytime
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.020]   and nocturnal animals, which tend to be awake at night,
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.660]   the longer the melatonin signal, the more depressed,
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.740]   not necessarily clinically depressed,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   although that can happen,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.140]   but the more depressed our systems tend to be.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:04.260]   Reproduction, metabolism, mood,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.180]   turnover rates of skin cells and hair cells
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.860]   all tend to be diminished
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.780]   compared to the spring and summer months for some,
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.540]   Northern hemisphere spring and summer months,
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.880]   or the times in which days are very long
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.660]   and there's less melatonin that tends to,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.600]   in almost all animals, including humans,
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.640]   more breeding, more hormone elevation
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.560]   of the hormones that stimulate breeding,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.100]   reproduction and fertility.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:36.100]   Metabolism is up, lipid metabolism, fat burning is up,
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.100]   protein synthesis is up.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.780]   These things tend to correlate with the seasons.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.300]   Now, some people are very, very strongly tied to the seasons.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.240]   They get depressed, clinically depressed in winter,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.540]   and light therapies are very useful for those people.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.920]   Some people love the winter and they're happiest in winter
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.420]   and they feel kind of depressed in summer,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.620]   although that is far more rare.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.820]   That doesn't mean depression cannot exist in the summer,
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.620]   but when we're talking about seasonal depression,
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.020]   that tends to be true.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.180]   It's more depression in winter.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.860]   Now there's other things that correlate with seasonality.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.600]   Suicide rates tend to be highest in the spring,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.940]   not in the winter,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.540]   but that has to do with some of the more complicated
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.120]   and unfortunately tragic aspects of suicide,
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.860]   which is that oftentimes people will commit suicide,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.380]   not at the very depths of their energy levels,
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.660]   but as they're emerging from those depths of low energy.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.620]   So we'll talk about suicidality and mood disorders
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.000]   in a later podcast season, meaning a month later.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.220]   But for now, just understand that everybody
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.820]   is going through these natural fluctuations
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.800]   depending on the duration of the melatonin signal.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.460]   Now, this might lead you to say,
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.120]   well, then I should just really get as much light as I can
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.900]   all the time and reduce melatonin
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.800]   and feel great all the time.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.000]   Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   because melatonin also has important effects
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.840]   on the immune system.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.900]   It has important effects on transmitter systems
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.860]   in the brain, et cetera.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.820]   So everybody needs to figure out for themselves
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.920]   how much light they need early in the day
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.100]   and how much light they need to avoid late in the day
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.580]   in order to optimize their mood and metabolism.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.520]   There is no one-size-fits-all prescription
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.140]   because there is a range of melatonin receptors.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.420]   There are a range of everything from metabolic types
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.360]   to genetic histories, family histories, et cetera.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.680]   There is no one-size-fits-all prescription,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.700]   but by understanding that light
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.160]   and extended day length inhibit melatonin
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.320]   and melatonin tends to be associated
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.800]   with a more depressed or reduced functioning
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.460]   of these kind of activity driving and mood elevating signals
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.820]   and understanding that you have some control over melatonin
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.900]   by way of light, including sunlight,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.340]   but also artificial light.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.200]   That should empower you, I believe,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.060]   to make the adjustments that if you're feeling low,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.920]   you might ask, how much light am I getting?
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.540]   When am I getting that light?
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.880]   Because sleep is also important for restoring mood, right?
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.740]   So you need sleep.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.860]   You can't just crush melatonin across the board
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.020]   and expect to feel good
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.960]   because then you're not going to fall asleep and stay asleep.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.880]   Melatonin not incidentally comes from,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.640]   is synthesized from serotonin.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.740]   Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.420]   with feelings of wellbeing provided to proper levels,
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   but wellbeing of a particular kind,
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.340]   wellbeing associated with quiescence and calm
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.820]   and the feeling that we have enough resources
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.060]   in our immediate kind of conditions.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.100]   It's the kind of thing that comes from a good meal
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.180]   or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.700]   or conversing with somebody that you really bond with.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   Serotonin does not stimulate action.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.580]   It tends to stimulate stillness.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.260]   Very different than the neuromodulator dopamine,
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.120]   which is a reward feel-good neuromodulator
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.700]   that stimulates action.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.700]   And actually dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine,
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.280]   to adrenaline, which actually puts us into action.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.420]   It's actually made from dopamine, right?
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.000]   So you can start to think about light as a signal
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.540]   that is very powerful for modulating things
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.620]   like sleep and wakefulness,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.500]   but also serotonin levels, melatonin levels.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.240]   And I talked about this previously,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.080]   but I'll mention once more
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.940]   that light in the middle of the night reduces dopamine levels
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.480]   to the point where it can start causing problems
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.640]   with learning and memory and mood.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   That's one powerful reason to avoid bright light
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.560]   in the middle of the night.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.380]   Okay, seasonal rhythms have a number of effects,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.420]   but humans are not purely seasonal breeders.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.920]   Unlike a lot of animals, we breed all year long.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.360]   In fact, there's a preponderance of September babies
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.000]   in my life, not actual babies,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.180]   but people that are born in September,
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.140]   which means that they were conceived in December.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.120]   Without knowing the details, we can fairly assume that.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.480]   And December, at least in the Northern hemisphere,
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.460]   days tend to be shorter and nights tend to be longer.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.860]   So clearly humans aren't seasonal breeders,
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.160]   but there are shifts in breeding and fertility
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.180]   that exist in humans,
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.660]   but also much more strongly in other animals.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.260]   So seasonal effects vary.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.320]   Some of you will experience very strong seasonal effects.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.980]   Others of you will not.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.520]   I think everybody should be taking care
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.020]   to get adequate sunlight and to avoid bright light at night
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.020]   throughout the year, if possible.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.920]   Throughout this podcast and in previous episodes,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.740]   I've been mentioning neuromodulators,
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.300]   things like serotonin and dopamine,
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.340]   which tend to bias certain brain circuits
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.960]   and things in our body to happen
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.700]   and certain brain circuits and things in our body
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.300]   not to happen.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.000]   One of the ones I've mentioned numerous times is epinephrine,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   which is a neuromodulator that tends to put us into action,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.520]   make us want to move.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.400]   In fact, when it's released in high amounts
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.200]   in our brain and body, it can lead to what we call stress
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.920]   or the feeling of being stressed.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.840]   Several people asked me,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.320]   what's the difference between epinephrine and adrenaline?
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.920]   Adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.880]   which sit right above our kidneys.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.080]   Epinephrine is the exact same molecule,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.640]   except that it's released within the brain.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.440]   And so people use these phrases
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.960]   or these words rather interchangeably.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.680]   Epi means near or on top of sometimes.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.180]   And neph, any time you see nephron or epi, it means kidney.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.280]   So it means near the kidney.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   So epinephrine actually means near the kidney.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.600]   So it was used originally to describe adrenaline,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.400]   but epinephrine and adrenaline are basically the same thing.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.600]   And they tend to stimulate agitation
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.480]   and the desire to move.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   That's what that's about.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.560]   Which brings us to the topic of exercise.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.920]   Got a lot of questions about exercise.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.560]   What forms of exercise are best for sleeping well?
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.520]   When should I exercise, et cetera?
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.740]   There's a lot of individual variability around this,
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.320]   but I can talk about what I know from the science literature
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.180]   and what I happen to do myself.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.240]   There are basically two forms of exercise
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.080]   that we can talk about.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.160]   Although of course I realize
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.100]   there are many different forms of exercise.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.360]   There's much more nuance to this,
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.600]   but we can talk about cardiovascular exercise
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.640]   where the idea is to repeat a movement
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.140]   over and over and over continuously.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.960]   So that'd be like running, biking, rowing,
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.000]   the cycling, this kind of thing.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.940]   Or there's a resistance exercise
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.360]   where you're moving, lifting,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.640]   presumably putting down also.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.960]   Things of progressively heavier and heavier weight
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.180]   that you couldn't do continuously for 30 minutes.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.340]   So cardiovascular exercise
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.520]   is typically the more aerobic type exercise
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.880]   and resistance exercise of course is the more anaerobic
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.720]   type exercise.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.040]   And yes, there's variation between the two.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.240]   Most studies of exercise have looked at aerobic exercise
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.080]   because that's basically the thing
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.240]   that you can get a rat or a mouse to do.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.840]   You know what's really weird about rats and mice?
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   They like to run on wheels so much
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.080]   that someone actually did this study
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.040]   it was published in Science.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.440]   They put a wheel, a running wheel in the middle of a field
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.920]   and mice ran to that wheel and ran on the wheel.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.920]   They turns out that what they like
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.700]   is the passage of the visual image of the bars
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.140]   in front of their face.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.640]   Which I find kind of remarkable and troubling
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.400]   'cause it seems so like trivial.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.760]   But anyway, they love aerobic exercise.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.620]   And so most of the studies were done on these mice
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.660]   that love running on wheels.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.140]   Whereas so far it's been challenging to find conditions
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.080]   in which mice really like to lift weights
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.840]   or will do it in a laboratory.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.160]   So any weight bearing exercise studies
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.000]   really have to be done in humans.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.840]   And since humans are what we're interested in
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.280]   there are some studies looking at these two things
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.000]   and when they tend to work best.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.280]   Now you will see some places aerobic exercise
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.360]   is best done in the morning
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.840]   and weight training is best done in the afternoon.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.880]   I think there's far more individual variation than that.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.800]   I think there are however a couple of windows
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.600]   that the exercise science literature
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.800]   and the circadian literature points to
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.520]   as windows related to body temperature
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.400]   in which performance injury,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.160]   in which performance is optimized,
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.260]   injury is reduced and so on.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.780]   And those tend to be 30 minutes after waking.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.040]   And that probably correlates with the inflection
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.920]   in cortisol associated with waking
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.840]   whether or not you've gotten light or not.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.500]   Three hours after waking
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.320]   which probably correlates to the rise in body temperature
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.080]   sometime right around waking.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.280]   And the later afternoon, usually 11 hours after waking
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.760]   which is when temperature tends to peak.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.100]   So some people like to exercise in the morning.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.620]   Some people like to exercise in the afternoon.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.160]   It really depends.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.240]   I think for those of us with very busy schedules
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.840]   it's advantageous to be able to do your training
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.480]   whenever you have the opportunity to do it
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.500]   unless you can really control your schedule.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.840]   And so I would never want these recommendations
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.000]   to seem like recommendations
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.740]   what I'm really describing as some opportunities
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.580]   30 minutes after waking,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.240]   three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.960]   has been shown at least in some studies
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.520]   to optimize performance, reduce injury
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.720]   and that sort of thing.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.320]   But you really have to figure out what works for you.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.960]   A note about working out first thing in the morning.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   Last time we talked about non-photic phase shifts.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.240]   If you exercise first thing in the morning
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.480]   your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.160]   There's actually plasticity in these circadian circuits
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.640]   that will lead you to want to wake up
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.400]   at the particular time that you exercise
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.040]   the previous three or four days.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.620]   So that can be a powerful tool
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.720]   but you still want to get light exposure
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.040]   because it turns out that light and exercise converge
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.240]   to giving even bigger wake up signal to the brain and body.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.040]   So you might want to think about that.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.280]   Some people find if they exercise late in the day
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.920]   they have trouble sleeping.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.880]   In general, intense exercise does that
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.000]   whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise doesn't.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.020]   I found some interesting literature
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.200]   that talked about sleep need and exercise.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   I found this fascinating that if one is waking
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.120]   not feeling rested and recovered from
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.820]   and yet sleeping the same amount that they typically have
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.920]   it's quite possible that the intensity of exercise
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.400]   in the preceding two or three days is too high.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.600]   Whereas if one can't recover
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.360]   no matter how much sleep they get
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.160]   they're just sleepy all the time
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.800]   I realize these things are correlated
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.420]   that the volume of training might be too high.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.880]   Now I'm not an exercise scientist.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.380]   We should probably get Andy Galpin or somebody else on here
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.120]   who's really an expert in this kind of stuff.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.720]   I do realize as soon as anyone talks about exercise
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.800]   or nutrition publicly
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   they're basically opening themselves up
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.880]   to all sorts of challenges
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.040]   because you can basically find support
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.060]   for almost any protocol in the literature.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.520]   What I've looked at was two journals in particular
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.320]   International Journal of Chronobiology
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.760]   and Journal Biological Rhythms, excuse me,
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.160]   to assess these parameters
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.420]   that I've mentioned just a moment ago
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.480]   because the studies tended to be done in humans.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.540]   They were fairly recent
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.880]   and they came from groups that I recognized
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.640]   as well as knowing that those journals are peer reviewed.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.500]   Many of your questions were about neural plasticity
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.400]   which is the brain and nervous system's ability to change
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.900]   in response to experience.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.780]   There was a question that asked
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.880]   whether or not these really deep biological mechanisms
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.360]   around wakefulness, time of waking, sleep, et cetera
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.780]   were subject to neural plasticity and indeed they are.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.640]   Some of that plasticity is short-term
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.960]   and some of it is more long-term.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.280]   There's a really good analogy here
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.080]   where every day, say at 8 a.m. noon and 7 p.m.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.160]   is when you eat your food, not suggesting you do this
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.440]   but let's say you were to do that for a couple of days.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.160]   After a few days, you would start to anticipate
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.040]   those meal times where no matter where you were
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.760]   in the world, no matter what was going on in your life
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.040]   about five to 10 minutes before those meal times
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.940]   you would start to feel hungry and even a little agitated
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.440]   which is your body's way of trying to get you
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.040]   to forage for food.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.640]   And that's because of some peptide signals
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.220]   that come from the periphery from your body.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.880]   Things like hypocretinorexin that signal to the hypothalamus
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.060]   and brainstem to make you active and alert
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.440]   and look for food and feel hungry.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.040]   So there's kind of an anticipatory circuit
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.980]   that's a chemical circuit but eventually over time
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.240]   the neurons, the neural circuits
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.860]   that control hypocretinorexin would get tuned
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.440]   to the neural circuits that are involved in eating
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.000]   and maybe even smell and taste to create a kind
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.920]   of eating circuit that's unique to your pattern,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.380]   to your rhythms.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.060]   The same thing is true for these waking and exercise
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.740]   and other schedules, including ultradian schedules.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.720]   If you wake up in the morning
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.860]   and start getting your sunlight,
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.160]   you start exercising in the morning
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   or you exercise in the afternoon,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.320]   pretty soon your body will start to anticipate that
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.020]   and start to secrete hormones and other signals
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.300]   that prepare your body for the ensuing activity
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.320]   of waking up or going to sleep.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.020]   So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.860]   even if that rhythm isn't down to the minute,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.140]   you'll find that there's plasticity in these circuits
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.000]   and it becomes easier to wake up early
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.220]   if that's your thing or exercise at a particular day
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.260]   if that's your thing.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.180]   That's the beauty of neuroplasticity.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.320]   A number of people asked,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.980]   what can I do to increase plasticity?
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.260]   And that really comes in two forms.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.920]   There's plasticity that we can access in sleep
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.140]   to improve rates of learning and depth of learning
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.040]   from the previous day or so.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.340]   And there's this NSDR, non-sleep deep breaths,
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.020]   that can be done without sleeping
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.980]   to improve rates of learning
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.500]   and depth of retention, et cetera.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.580]   So let's consider those both
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.820]   and you can incorporate these protocols if you like.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.640]   Again, these are based on quality peer-reviewed studies.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.260]   First, let's talk about learning in sleep.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.400]   This is based on some work
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.900]   that I'll provide the reference for
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.660]   that was published in the journal Science.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.540]   Excellent journal.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.340]   Matt Walker also talks about some of these studies
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.860]   done by others in his book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.620]   The studies, just to remind you,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.720]   are structured the following way.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.260]   An individual is brought into a laboratory,
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.900]   does a spatial memory task.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.820]   So there tends to be a screen
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.600]   with a bunch of different objects
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.420]   popping up on the screen in different locations.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.020]   So it might be a bulldog's face,
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.940]   there might be a cat,
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.060]   then it might be an apple,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.220]   then it might be a pen in different locations.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.980]   And that sounds trivially easy,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.660]   but with time you can imagine it gets pretty tough
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.660]   to come back a day later and remember
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.100]   if something presented in a given location
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.560]   was something you've seen before
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.380]   and whether or not it was presented in that location
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.340]   or a different location.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.060]   If you had enough objects and change the locations enough,
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.180]   this can actually be quite difficult.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.460]   In this study, the subjects
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.300]   either just went through the experiment
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.880]   or a particular odor was released into the room
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.580]   while they were learning,
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.880]   or a tone was played in the room
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.020]   while they were learning.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.840]   And then during the sleep of those subjects
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.600]   the following night and the following night,
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.260]   this was done repeatedly for several nights,
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.900]   the same odor or tone was played
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.880]   while the subjects were sleeping.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.460]   They did this in different stages of sleep,
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.740]   non-REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.520]   They did this with just the tone in sleep
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.480]   if the subjects had had the odor, but not the tone,
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.500]   they did it with putting the tone,
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.260]   if they had had the odor while learning.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.500]   So basically all the controls,
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.060]   all the things you'd want to see done
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.200]   to make sure that it wasn't some indirect effect,
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.460]   some modulatory effect, okay?
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   And what they found was that providing the same stimulus,
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.540]   the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.500]   if the subjects heard a tone while learning,
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.040]   if they just delivered that odor or tone
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.020]   while the subjects slept,
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.520]   rates of learning and retention of information
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.220]   was significantly greater.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.140]   This is pretty cool.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.340]   What this means that you can cue the subconscious brain,
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.460]   the asleep brain to learn particular things
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.860]   better and faster.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.180]   So how might you implement this?
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.380]   Well, you could play with this if you want.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.060]   I don't see any real challenge to this provided the odor
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.040]   is a safe one and it doesn't wake you up
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.400]   and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.100]   You could do this by having a metronome, for instance,
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.500]   while learning something,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.420]   playing in the background or particular music,
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.060]   and then have that very faintly while you sleep.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.100]   So you could apply this if you like and try this.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.260]   There are a number of groups, I think now,
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.420]   that are trying this using tactile stimulation.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.300]   So slight vibration on the wrist during learning
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.860]   and then the same vibration on the wrist during sleep.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.340]   It does not appear that the sensory modality,
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:19.260]   whether or not it's odor or auditory tone or tactile
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.460]   stimulation, somatosensory stimulation,
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.820]   whether or not it matters.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.580]   It's remarkable because it really shows
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.840]   that sleep is an extension of the waking state.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.320]   We've known that for a long time,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.620]   but this really tethers those two
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.360]   in a very meaningful and actionable way.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.140]   So I think I'll report back to you
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.500]   as I learn more about these studies,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.100]   but that's what I know about them at this point.
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.080]   As long as we're there, we might as well talk about dreaming
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.420]   'cause I got so many questions about dreams.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.180]   A couple of people want to ask me what their dreams meant.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.080]   Look, I don't even know what my dreams mean half the time.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:53.780]   I occasionally will wake up from a dream and remember it.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.580]   If you want to remember your dreams better,
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.700]   if you're somebody who has challenges
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.100]   remembering your dreams, you can set your alarm
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.320]   so that you wake up in the middle
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.860]   of one of these 90 minute cycles,
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.780]   which toward morning tend to be occupied
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.460]   almost exclusively by REM sleep.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.500]   Remember early in the night, you have less REM sleep
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.140]   than later in the night,
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.800]   but you want to get as much sleep as you can
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.640]   'cause that's healthy.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.900]   So I don't know that you want to wake yourself up.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.300]   Some people find that writing down their thoughts
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.940]   immediately first thing in the morning
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.000]   allows them to later spontaneously remember
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.300]   their dream they had.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.020]   There's some literature on that.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.580]   The meaning of dreams is a little bit controversial.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.140]   Some people believe they have strong meaning.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.380]   Other people believe that they can be
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.700]   just spontaneous firing of neurons that were active
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.640]   in the waking state and don't have any meaning.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.920]   There are good data to show that when you learn spatial,
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.100]   new spatial environments,
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.780]   that there's a replay of those environments,
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.600]   so-called place cells that fire in your brain
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.560]   only when you enter a particular environment,
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.100]   that those are replayed in sleep in almost direct fashion
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.540]   to the way that things were activated
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.460]   when you were learning that spatial task.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.060]   Dreams are fascinating.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.940]   We're paralyzed during dreams,
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.760]   which brings us to another question.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.820]   Somebody asked about sleep paralysis.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.340]   We are paralyzed for much of our sleep, so-called atonia.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.860]   So presumably, so we don't act out our dreams.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.400]   Some people wake up and they're still paralyzed.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.220]   I've actually had this happen to me,
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.860]   not very many times, but a few times,
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.660]   and then they jolt themselves awake.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.380]   And it actually is quite terrifying.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.540]   I can say from personal experience to wake up,
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.200]   be wide awake and you cannot move your body at all.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.860]   It's really quite frightening.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.940]   There are a couple of things that will increase
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.520]   the intrusion of atonia into the wakeful state,
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.560]   which is essentially means you're waking up,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.460]   but you can't move.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.340]   One is marijuana, THC.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.640]   I'm not a marijuana smoker.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.680]   I'm not a cop or I don't know the legality where you live.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.760]   So I'm not saying one thing or another about marijuana.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.060]   I'm just, the fact that I had that experience
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.320]   without marijuana means that it can happen regardless.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.920]   But marijuana smokers, for whatever reason,
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.120]   maybe it has something to do with the cannabinoid receptors
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.180]   or the serotonin receptors downstream
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.480]   of the motor pathways, I don't know.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.000]   I couldn't find any literature on this,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.080]   but marijuana smokers report higher frequency
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.520]   of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.900]   as you transition from sleep to wakefulness.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.520]   I suppose probably one could learn
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.680]   to get comfortable with it.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.160]   For me, it was terrifying
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.340]   'cause I'm just used to being able
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.340]   to move my limbs fortunately, and I wasn't able to.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:35.340]   And it's quite a thing, let me tell you.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.740]   Okay, some other questions about neuroplasticity.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.740]   So the other form of neuroplasticity
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.900]   is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:50.460]   by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep,
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.140]   but the neuroplasticity that you can access
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.160]   with non-sleep deep rest.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.180]   So NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.360]   as well as short 20-minute naps,
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.500]   which are very close to non-sleep deep rest
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.180]   because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.020]   during short naps unless they're very sleep deprived.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.900]   NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.940]   when done for 20-minute bouts
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:20.420]   to match an approximately 90-minute bout of learning.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.680]   So what am I talking about?
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.760]   90-minute cycles are these ultradian cycles
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.380]   that I've talked about previously.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.500]   And we tend to learn very well by taking a 90-minute cycle,
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.660]   when it's hard to focus and then deep focus
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.300]   and learning feels almost like agitation and strain.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.500]   And then by the end of that 90-minute cycle,
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.700]   it becomes very hard to maintain focus
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.660]   and learn more information.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.980]   There's a study published in Cell Reports last year,
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.900]   great journal, excellent paper,
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:56.260]   showing that 20-minute naps or light sleep
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.000]   of the sort of non-sleep deep rest
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.080]   taken immediately after or close to,
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.220]   it doesn't have to be immediately
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.120]   after you finished the last sentence of learning
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.080]   or whatever it is or bar of music.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.180]   But a couple of minutes after transitioning
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.920]   to a period of non-sleep deep rest
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.740]   where you're turning off the analysis of duration path
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.400]   and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.020]   to a significant degree,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.720]   both the amount of information
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.680]   and the retention of that information.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   So that's pretty cool because this is a cost-free,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.420]   drug-free way of accelerating learning
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.560]   without having to get more sleep,
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.660]   but simply by introducing these 20-minute bouts.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.700]   I would encourage people if they want to try this
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.220]   to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.860]   of ultradian learning cycle.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.740]   There you're incorporating
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.380]   a number of different neuroscience-backed tools,
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.060]   90-minute cycles for focused learning,
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.580]   it could be motor, it could be cognitive,
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.260]   it could be musical, whatever,
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.120]   and then transition to a 20-minute
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.300]   non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.480]   I just want to cue you the fact that in last episode
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.020]   in the caption on YouTube,
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.280]   we provided links to two different
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.400]   yoga nidra non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.840]   as well as hypnosis protocols that are clinically backed
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.620]   from my colleague David Spiegel
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.460]   at Stanford Psychiatry Department.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.500]   All those resources are free.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.500]   There are also a lot of other hypnosis scripts out there.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.800]   I like the ones from Michael Sealy, S-E-A-L.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.260]   I think it's E-Y, although maybe it's just L-Y.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.060]   You can find them easily on YouTube.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.260]   Clinical hypnosis scripts, meaning not staged hypnosis.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.580]   They're not designed to get you to do anything.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.960]   In fact, they're just designed
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.280]   to help rewire your brain circuitry.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.580]   Now, how does hypnosis work that way?
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.820]   This has a lot to do with sleep
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.940]   because it engages neuroplasticity by bringing together
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.360]   two things that normally are separate from one another.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.200]   One is the alert focused wakeful state
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.740]   where you activate the learning.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.460]   And then there's the deep rest
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.580]   where the actual reconfiguration
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.140]   of the neurons and synapses takes place.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.300]   Hypnosis brings both the focus and the deep rest component
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.980]   into the same compartment of time.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.940]   It's a very unique state in that way.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.020]   So hypnosis kind of maximizes the learning bout
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.020]   and the non-sleep deep rest bout and combines them.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.700]   But of course, that requires some guidance from a script
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.020]   or from a hypnotist, clinically trained hypnotist,
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.000]   and it becomes hard to acquire detailed information.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.960]   It's more about shifts in state like fear to states of calm
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   or smoking to quitting smoking, anxiety around a trauma
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.620]   to release of anxiety around a trauma
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:40.420]   rather than specific information learned in hypnosis, okay?
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.020]   So hypnosis seems more about modulating the circuits
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.440]   that underlie state as opposed to specific information.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.680]   Although I would not be surprised
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.300]   if there weren't certain forms of hypnosis
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.520]   that could increase retention and learning
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.500]   of specific information,
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.540]   but I'm not aware of any of those protocols out there yet.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.060]   Which brings us to the next thing
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.940]   about learning and plasticity,
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.000]   which is nootropics, AKA smart drugs.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.080]   This is a big topic.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.060]   That sigh was a sigh of concern
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:14.060]   about how to address nootropics in a thorough enough
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.940]   but thoughtful enough way.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.100]   Look, I have a lot of thoughts about nootropics.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.640]   First of all, it means smart drugs, I believe.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.940]   And I don't like that phrase
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.840]   because let's just take a step back
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.360]   and think about exercise.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.160]   You just say, I want to be more physically fit.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.200]   What does that mean?
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.400]   Does it mean, I would ask for more specificity.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.440]   I'd say, do you want to be stronger?
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.320]   Okay, maybe you need to lift heavier objects progressively.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.260]   Do you want more endurance?
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.200]   Very different protocol to access endurance.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.340]   Do you want flexibility?
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.880]   Do you want explosiveness or suppleness?
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.640]   Huge range of things that we call physical fitness.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.660]   Maybe you want all of those.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.740]   If we were talking about emotional fitness,
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.320]   we would say, well, an ability to feel empathy,
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.460]   but probably also to disengage from empathy
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.500]   because you don't want to be tethered
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.980]   to other people's emotions all the time.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.960]   That's not healthy either.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.060]   You would think about being able
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.120]   to access a range of emotions,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.780]   but for some people,
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.580]   their range into the sadness regime is really quite vast,
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.320]   but their range into the happiness regime
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.280]   might be kind of limited.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.240]   For other people who are in a manic state,
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.200]   it might be they can access all the happy stuff,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.940]   but not the sadder stuff.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.320]   So I'm speaking by way of analogy here,
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   but if we say, we're talking about cognitive abilities,
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:37.980]   we have to ask, okay, creativity, memory.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.940]   We tend to associate intelligence with memory.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.340]   I think this goes back to like spelling bees or something,
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.540]   the ability to retain a lot of information.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.460]   And just regurgitate information,
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.620]   which will get you some distance in some disciplines of life
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.460]   but it won't allow you creative thinking.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.640]   It's necessary for creative thinking.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.780]   You need a knowledge base, right?
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.600]   You can't just look up everything on Google,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.800]   despite what certain educators or so-called educators say.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.220]   You need a database so that you have the raw materials
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.380]   with which to be creative.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.620]   So necessary to have memory,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.020]   but not sufficient to be creative, right?
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.260]   The creative could have a poor memory for certain things,
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:17.740]   but certainly not for everything.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.300]   They can't have anterograde and retrograde amnesia.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.620]   They'd be like the goldfish that every time around the tank,
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.660]   it can't remember where it's at.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.100]   I actually don't know that they've ever done
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.060]   that experiment by the way,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.240]   so no disrespect to goldfish, but you know.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.380]   So you get the idea, you've got creativity,
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.780]   you have memory, you have the ability to task switch, right?
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.860]   You have the ability to strategy develop
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.020]   and strategy implement.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.860]   So the problem I have with the concept of a nootropic
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.720]   or a smart drug is it's not specific
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.660]   as to what cognitive algorithm you're trying to engage.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.540]   We need more specificity.
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.120]   That said, there are elements to learning
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.380]   that we've discussed here before that are very concrete.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.780]   Things like the ability to focus
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.820]   and put the blinders on to everything else
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.660]   that's happening around you and in your head mainly, right?
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.400]   Distractions about things you should be doing,
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.280]   could be doing or might be doing
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.140]   and focus on what you need to do.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.660]   And then that's required for triggering
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.820]   the acetylcholine neuromodulator
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.780]   that will then allow you to highlight
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.840]   the particular synapses that will then later change in sleep.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   So no nootropic allows you to bypass the need
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.860]   for sleep and deep rest.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.280]   That's important to understand.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   So I daydream about a day when people will be able
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.220]   to access compounds that are safe,
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.760]   that will allow them to learn better,
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.240]   meaning to access information, focus better,
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.340]   as well as to sleep better and activate the plasticity
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.940]   from the learning bout.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.240]   Right now, most nootropics tend to bundle
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.400]   a bunch of things together.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:59.580]   Most of them include some form of stimulant, caffeine.
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.740]   Episode two, I tell you more probably
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.820]   than you ever wanted to know about caffeine adenosine
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.660]   and how that works.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.460]   So refer there for how caffeine works.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.760]   But stimulants will allow you to increase focus
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.520]   up to a particular point.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.320]   If you have too little alertness in your system,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.640]   you can't focus too much.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.400]   However, you start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.100]   So you can't just ingest more stimulant to be more focused.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.540]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.000]   Most nootropics also include things that increase
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.400]   or are designed to increase acetylcholine,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.060]   things like alpha-GPC and other things of that sort.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.820]   And indeed there's some evidence
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.240]   that they can increase acetylcholine.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.120]   I refer you again to examine.com, the website,
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.300]   to evaluate any supplements or compounds for their safety
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.340]   and their effects in humans and animals.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:49.900]   Free website, as well as with links to studies.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.740]   So we need the focus component.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.980]   We need the alertness component.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.820]   The alertness component comes from epinephrine,
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.260]   traditionally from caffeine stimulation.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.100]   The acetylcholine stimulation traditionally comes
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.820]   from choline donors or alpha-GPC, things of that sort.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.020]   And then you would want to have some sort of off switch
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.880]   because anything that's going to really stimulate
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.360]   your alertness that then provides a crash,
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.880]   that crash is not a crash into the deep kind
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.520]   of restful slumber that you would want for learning.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.520]   It's a crash into the kind of,
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:26.840]   let's just call it lopsided sleep, meaning it's deep sleep,
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.320]   but it lacks certain spindles and other elements
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.180]   of the physiology, sleep spindles,
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.700]   that really engage the learning process
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.880]   and the reconfiguration of synapses.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   So right now, my stance on nootropics is that maybe,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.600]   maybe for occasional use, provided it's safe for you,
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.480]   I'm not recommending it, but in general,
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.560]   it tends to use more of a shotgun approach
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.000]   than is probably going to be useful
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.900]   for learning and memory in the long run.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.620]   A lot of people ask about modafinil or armodafinil,
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.540]   which was designed for treatment of narcolepsy.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.440]   So right there, it tells you it's a stimulant.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.560]   And yes, there is evidence
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.860]   it will improve learning and memory.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.340]   Modafinil is very expensive.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.120]   Last time I checked, armodafinil, I think,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.880]   is the recent released generic version of this
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.920]   that's far less expensive.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.040]   Most of these things look a lot like amphetamine,
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.380]   and many of them have the potential for addiction
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.200]   or can be habit forming, but more importantly,
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.160]   a lot of those things also can create metabolic effects
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.480]   by disruption to insulin receptors and so forth.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.720]   So you want to approach those with a strong sense of caution.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.240]   Now, there are the milder things that act as nootropics.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.420]   I mentioned some of them, like alpha-GPC.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.760]   Some people like ginkgo.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.720]   Ginkgo gives me vicious headaches, so I don't take it.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.680]   So people really differ.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.080]   Last podcast, I recommended magnesium threonate
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.960]   if you were exploring supplements.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.600]   I'm not recommending anything directly.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.580]   I'm just saying if you're exploring supplements,
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.980]   magnesium threonate seems among the magnesiums
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.200]   to be one of the more bioavailable and useful for sleep.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.500]   I recommend it actually to a good friend of mine.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.580]   It gave him, at very low dose,
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.300]   he had stomach issues with it.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.820]   He just had to simply stop taking it.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.200]   So there's variability there.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.340]   It gave him some stomach cramping
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.800]   and just didn't feel good on it.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.540]   Stopped it, he felt better.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.580]   Other people take magnesium threonate and feel great.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.000]   I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.180]   with or without food, daytime or before sleep?
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.080]   If you're going to go that route,
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.340]   it should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before sleep
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.040]   'cause it's designed to make you sleepy.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.420]   And I'm not aware that it has to be taken with food,
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.480]   but again, all of this has to be run by your doctor
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.200]   and this is your healthcare to govern.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.800]   These are not strict recommendations, so look into it.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.640]   But magnesium threonate,
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.180]   most people I've recommended it to
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.160]   have benefit from it tremendously.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.240]   Some people can't tolerate it, so you have to find out.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.280]   There were a number of questions about other supplements
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.660]   designed to access deep sleep
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.800]   in part to access neuroplasticity,
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.440]   but now I'm just sort of transitioning
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.180]   from neuroplasticity to these compounds
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.120]   that can regulate sleep.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.240]   One of them that I discussed at the end of the last podcast,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   I got a lot of questions about, is apigenin,
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.000]   A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.760]   Apigenin, if you look in the literature,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.260]   the way it works is it increases some of the enzymes
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.100]   associated with GABA metabolism.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.640]   It actually, GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.280]   It's the neurotransmitter that is increased
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.960]   after a couple drinks containing alcohol
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.700]   and that shut down the forebrain.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.500]   Apigenin is a derivative of the chamomile.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.600]   I think the proper pronunciation of this
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.640]   is matricaria chamomila,
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.880]   although I always feel like I should be using
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.080]   a Spanish accent whenever I say something like that.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.320]   Other related things that impact the GABA system
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.880]   and increase GABA are things like passion flower,
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.040]   which is passiflora incurata.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.280]   I don't know why the Italian, is that Italian?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.120]   Anyway, my Italian colleagues, please forgive me.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.500]   I have some very close Italian friends
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.820]   and colleagues in Genoa.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.600]   I butchered the Italian, sorry.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.300]   In any event, apigenin and passion flower
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.400]   found in a lot of supplements
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.560]   designed to increase sleepiness and sleep
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.800]   and they work presumably because they increase GABA.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.060]   Actually, they work on chloride channels
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.360]   rather than give you a whole lecture
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.800]   on membrane biophysics and neurons.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.200]   I'll just say that when neurons are really active,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.740]   it's because sodium ions, salt, rushes into the cells
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.680]   and causes them to fire electrically.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.680]   The cells tend to become less active as more chloride,
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.860]   which is a negatively charged ion.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.240]   This is probably taking some of you back
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.840]   to either the wonderful times or traumas
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.280]   of high school physics.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.040]   The chloride is negatively charged
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.380]   so it tends to make cells less electrically positive
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.080]   'cause it carries a negative charge
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.460]   and hyperpolarizes the neuron.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.580]   So apigenin works through these,
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.960]   increasing the activity of these chloride channels.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.100]   Passion flower works by increasing the activity
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.500]   of these chloride channels and GABA transmission.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.340]   It tends to increase this inhibitory neurotransmitter
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.480]   that shuts off our thinking,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.740]   our analysis of duration, path, and outcome.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.220]   So if you're going to explore these things,
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.340]   I suggest you at least know how they work.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.300]   You at least go to examine.com
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.340]   that you talk to your doctor about them.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.740]   Some people asked about serotonin
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.820]   for getting to sleep and staying asleep.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.580]   Now, I understand the rationale here.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.980]   Just like I understand the rationale
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.660]   of taking something like mucuna purines or L-DOPA
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.880]   to increase dopamine,
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.780]   but sometimes what works on paper
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.920]   doesn't really work in the real world.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.100]   I personally have tried taking a supplement
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.860]   which was L-Tryptophan,
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.460]   which is the precursor to serotonin or 5-HTP,
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.040]   which is designed to increase,
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.620]   it is serotonin basically.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.380]   You're just one biochemical step away
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.100]   from taking actual serotonin.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.180]   And I'll be honest,
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.940]   the sleep that I had with increased serotonin
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.740]   by way of tryptophan or 5-HTP was dreadful.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.620]   I fell asleep almost immediately.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   You say, well, that's great.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.220]   And 90 minutes later I woke up
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.420]   and I couldn't sleep almost for 48 hours.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.260]   Now that was me.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.180]   I have a pretty sensitive system to certain things
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.220]   and not to other things.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.500]   Some people love these things.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.340]   So you really have to be thoughtful
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.460]   and explore them with that kind of awareness
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.140]   of being thoughtful
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.040]   and realizing that what works for you
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.060]   might not work for everybody
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.780]   and what works for everybody might not work for you.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.020]   Okay, I'd like to continue
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.740]   by talking about the role of temperature in sleep,
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.940]   accessing sleep, staying asleep and wakefulness.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.340]   But first I want to tell a joke
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.380]   because I think this joke really captures
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.620]   some of the critical things to understand
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.160]   about any self-experimentation that you might do.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.220]   So this is a story that was told to me
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.140]   by a colleague of mine who's now a professor of Caltech,
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.220]   not to be named.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:57.080]   So there's a scientist and they're in their lab
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.020]   and they're trying to understand
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.100]   how the nervous system works.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.860]   So they go over to a tank and they pick up a frog
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.500]   and they take the frog
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.960]   and they put it down on the table and they clap.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.400]   [claps]
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.440]   And the frog jumps.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.320]   So they think for a while, they pick up the frog, okay.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.160]   They go over to the cabinet
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.520]   and they take out a little bit of a paralytic drug
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.240]   and they inject it locally into the back leg,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.220]   set it down and clap.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.440]   [claps]
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.880]   And the frog jumps,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.760]   but it kind of like jumps to the side a little bit.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.440]   And they pick it up.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.520]   They inject the paralytic into the other back leg.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.200]   They clap again.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.960]   The frog jumps, but it really doesn't jump well that time.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.320]   It kind of drags itself forward.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.100]   So they pick it up and they inject the paralytic
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.320]   into the remaining two legs.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.440]   They set it down and they clap.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.640]   The frog doesn't jump.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.800]   They go, "Oh my goodness, the legs are used for hearing."
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.280]   Now they publish the paper.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.520]   Paper comes out in a great journal, news releases.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.520]   It's a really big deal.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.440]   Their career takes off.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.240]   20 years later, a really smart graduate student comes along
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.360]   and says, "Yeah, but that's loss of function."
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.380]   Doesn't really show gain of function.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.820]   So let's take a closer look.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.800]   So they repeat the first experiment and it checks out.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.400]   Everything happens the same way.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.640]   But then they take the frog
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.680]   and they inject a drug into all four legs
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.160]   that turns off the paralytic, right?
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.560]   It's an antagonist.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.580]   They set the frog down.
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.240]   They clap and the frog jumps.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.180]   They go, "Oh my goodness, it's true.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.180]   The legs really are for hearing."
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.780]   Now, first of all, I want to make the point
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.280]   that this is not to illustrate
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.080]   that science is not a good practice.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:52.920]   It is.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.480]   We need to do loss of function
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.720]   and gain in function experiments.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.360]   But just to show that correlation
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.220]   and causation is complicated,
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.440]   you need to do a variety of control experiments
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.800]   and you really need to figure out what works for you.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.640]   And so while science can provide answers
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.200]   about what works under very controlled conditions,
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.100]   it doesn't and can never address all the situations
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.620]   in which a given compound,
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.780]   a given practice will or won't work.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.360]   And it's not just individual variability,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.120]   it's that there are a number of different factors.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.940]   You all, of course, know that light can activate
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.120]   and shift your circadian rhythm,
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.260]   but so can exercise, so can food.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.940]   The last point I want to make is an important one,
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.020]   which is that no frogs were hurt
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.980]   in the telling of this joke.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.640]   Okay, so let's continue.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.380]   I want to talk about temperature.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.140]   Temperature is super interesting
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.520]   as it relates to circadian rhythms
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.260]   and wakefulness and sleep.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.580]   First, let's take a look at what's happening
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   to our body temperature across each 24-hour cycle.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.780]   In general, our temperature tends to be lowest
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.660]   right around 4 a.m. and starts creeping up
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.220]   around 6 a.m., 8 a.m., and peaks sometime
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.200]   between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.260]   Now, that varies from person to person,
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.980]   but in general, if we were to continuously monitor
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.180]   or occasionally monitor temperature,
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.940]   that's what we would see.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.940]   Now, what's interesting is that even in the absence
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:19.580]   of any light cues or meal cues, we would have a shift.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.080]   We would have an oscillation or a rhythm in our temperature
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.460]   that would go from high to low.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.660]   This is why the idea that we're all 96.8
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.620]   and that's our correct temperature, forget that.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.500]   That is no longer true.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.580]   It never was true.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.220]   It depends on what time of day you measure temperature.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.320]   However, there is a range which is within normal range.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.940]   I think most of us associate fever
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.480]   with somewhere around 100, 101, 103.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.940]   That's concerning, and we will be very concerned
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.580]   if temperature dropped too low as well.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.140]   The way that the temperature rhythm that's endogenous,
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.700]   that's within us and rhythmic no matter what,
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:57.100]   the way it gets anchored to the pattern I described before
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.480]   of being lowest at 4 a.m. and increasing again
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.620]   around through the day until about 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:08.620]   is by way of entrainment or matching to some external cue,
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.320]   which is almost always going to be light, but also exercise.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.100]   Now, you may have experienced this temperature rhythm
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.820]   and how quickly it can become unentrained
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.540]   or it can fall out of entrainment.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.900]   Here's an experiment I wouldn't want you to do,
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.120]   but you've probably experienced this before,
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.420]   where you wake up, it's sunny outside,
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.780]   and maybe you have some email or some things to take care of,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.400]   or maybe you didn't sleep that well the night before,
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.660]   and so you stay indoors.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.340]   You don't change anything about your breakfast.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.620]   You don't change anything about your within-home temperature
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.940]   or anything like that.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.900]   And somewhere right around 10 or 11 o'clock,
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.880]   you start feeling kind of chilled, like you're cold.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.620]   Well, what happened was the oscillators,
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.380]   the clocks in your various tissues
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.100]   that are governed by temperature and circadian rhythm
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.680]   are starting to split away
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.880]   from your central clock mechanisms.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.300]   So it's actually important
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.740]   that your temperature match day length.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.840]   Now, there's another way in which temperature matches,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.440]   or daytime, excuse me.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.860]   There's also an important way
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.520]   in which temperature matches day length.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.560]   In general, as days get longer, it tends to be hotter out.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.320]   Not always, but in general, that's the way it is.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.740]   And as days get shorter, it tends to be colder outside.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.440]   So temperature and day length are also linked,
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.820]   metabolically they're linked,
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.780]   biologically they're linked, excuse me,
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.320]   and atmospherically they're linked,
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.660]   for the reasons that we talked about before
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.980]   about duration of day length
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.440]   and other climate features and so forth.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.460]   So one of the most powerful things
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.780]   about setting your circadian rhythm properly
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.200]   is that your temperature will start to fall
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.400]   into a regular rhythm.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.420]   And that temperature has a very strong effect
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.440]   on things like metabolism
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.100]   and when you will feel most willing
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.420]   and interested in exercising.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.160]   Typically, the willingness to exercise and engage
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.240]   in any kind of activity, mental or physical,
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.600]   is going to be when that rise in temperature is steepest,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.220]   when the slope of that line is greatest,
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.040]   that's why 30 minutes after waking
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.300]   is one of those key windows,
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.040]   as well as three hours after waking,
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.340]   and then when temperature actually peaks,
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:17.340]   which is generally, generally about 11 hours after waking.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:20.580]   So this is why we say that temperature
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.380]   and circadian rhythm are linked,
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.320]   but they're actually even more linked than that.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.900]   We've talked before about how light enters the eye,
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.120]   triggers activation of these melanopsin cells,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.920]   which then triggers activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.660]   the master circadian clock.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.620]   And then I always say the master circadian clock
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.860]   informs all the cells and tissues of your body
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.780]   and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.080]   But what I've never answered
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.660]   was how it actually puts them into that rhythm.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.380]   And it does it two ways.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.180]   One is it secretes a peptide.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.480]   A peptide is just a little protein
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.400]   that floats through the bloodstream
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.660]   and signals to the cells,
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.820]   okay, we're tuning your clock
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.760]   kind of like a little, you know, in a watch store,
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.300]   the watch store owner would tune the clocks.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.680]   But the other way is it synchronizes the temperature
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.820]   under which those cells exist.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.720]   So temperature is actually the effector
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.660]   of the circadian rhythm.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.200]   Now, this is really important
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.620]   because changes in temperature by way of exercise,
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.740]   by way of eating, but especially by way of exercise
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.220]   can start to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.920]   But let's even go to a more extreme example.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.160]   Nowadays, there's some interest in cold showers
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.240]   and ice baths.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.880]   Not everybody is doing this, I realize.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.200]   People seem to either love this or hate this.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.480]   I don't mind the cold dunk thing.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.280]   I get regular about this from time to time and I'll do it.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.880]   I haven't been doing it recently.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.760]   It's always painful to do the first couple of times
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.280]   and then you get kind of used to it.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.960]   However, I've taken people to a cold dunk or an ice bath.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.740]   I have a family member who wouldn't get in literally
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:49.860]   past her toes.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.940]   She was like, this is just too aversive for me.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.180]   Some people really liked the cold.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.660]   People very tremendously.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.840]   Getting into an ice bath is very interesting
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.520]   because you have a rebound increase in thermogenesis.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.720]   Now you should know from the previous episode
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.020]   that as that temperature increases,
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.980]   it will shift your circadian rhythm
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.140]   and which direction it shifts your circadian rhythm
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.360]   will depend on whether or not you're doing it
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.780]   during the daytime or late in the day.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.840]   If you do it after 8 p.m., it's going to make your day
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.720]   longer, right?
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.320]   Because your body and your central clocks
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.640]   are used to temperature going up early in the day
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.780]   and throughout the day and peaking in the afternoon.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.100]   If you then increase that further
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.080]   or you simply increase it over its baseline at 8 p.m.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.220]   after temperature was already falling,
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.560]   even if it's just by a half a degree or a couple of degrees
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.800]   or you do that with exercise,
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.360]   doesn't have to be with the ice bath,
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.800]   you are extending, you are shifting forward,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.280]   you're phase delaying your clock,
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.920]   you're convincing your clock
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.320]   and therefore the rest of your body
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.520]   that the day is still going, right?
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.960]   You're giving it the perception,
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.820]   the cellular and physiological perception
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.960]   that the day is getting longer
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.560]   and you will want to naturally stay up later
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.220]   and wake up later.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.680]   Now you might say, wait, I do an ice bath late at night
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.300]   and I feel great and I fall deeply asleep.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.640]   Well, cold can trigger the release of melatonin.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.460]   There's a rebound increase in melatonin.
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.760]   So that could be the cause of that effect.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.320]   You have to see what works for you.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.260]   But if you do the ice bath early in the day
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:20.040]   and then get out, you will experience a more rapid rise
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.180]   or cold shower early in the day,
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:25.120]   a more rapid rise in your body temperature
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.140]   that will phase advance your clock
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.300]   and make it easier to get up early the following day.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.060]   So for those of you that are having trouble getting up
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:34.580]   and this is going to almost sound laughable
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.420]   but a cold shower first thing in the morning
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.740]   will wake you up but that's waking you up
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.580]   in the short term because of a different mechanism
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.980]   which I'll talk about in a moment.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.660]   But it also is shifting your clock.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.220]   It's phase advancing your clock
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.460]   in a way that makes you more likely
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.380]   to get up earlier the next day, okay?
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.620]   So in other words, increasing your temperature
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:59.040]   by getting in an ice bath or cold shower or exercising
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.000]   which causes a compensatory increase in body temperature.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.180]   Think about the normal pattern of body temperature,
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:09.220]   low around 4.30, 5 a.m., starts to peak right around waking,
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.620]   excuse me, starts to increase right around waking,
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.840]   then steep slope, steep slope to a peak
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.340]   around 4 to 6 p.m. and then drops off.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.460]   If you introduce an increase in body temperature
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.980]   by way of cold exposure early in the day,
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.960]   let's say 6 a.m. or 5 a.m. if you're masochistic enough
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.740]   to get into a cold shower at that time, more power to you,
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:31.740]   it's going to make you want to wake up about half hour
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.140]   to an hour earlier the next day than you normally would.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:37.020]   Whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling,
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.420]   it will tend to delay and make your body perceive
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.300]   as if the day is getting longer.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.480]   These are phase advances and phase delays.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.560]   We're going to get into this in far more detail
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.700]   when we talk about jet lag and shift work in episode four
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.260]   as well as other things.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.240]   But temperature is, again, it's not just one tool
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.560]   to manipulate wake-up time and circadian rhythm
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.140]   and metabolism, it is the effector.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.240]   It is the way that the central circadian clock
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.380]   impacts all the cells and tissues of your body.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.080]   If you want to read further about this
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.120]   and you're really curious about the role of temperature,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.740]   work by Joe Takahashi,
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.480]   who used to be at Northwestern University
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.680]   and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.180]   incredible scientist and has really worked out
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.720]   a lot of the mechanisms around temperature
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.640]   and circadian rhythms.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.920]   You can just Google his name
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.360]   and you'll see a whole bunch of studies there.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.140]   I want to talk about cold and cold exposure
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.840]   because there's a great misconception about this
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.780]   that actually you can leverage once you understand
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.840]   how to use cold to either increase thermogenesis
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.040]   and fat loss, metabolism,
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.080]   or you can use it for stress mitigation and mood.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.380]   And it really depends on one simple feature
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.780]   of how you approach the ice bath or cold shower.
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.000]   If you get into an ice bath or cold shower
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.080]   and you are calming yourself,
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.440]   you're actively calming the autonomic nervous system,
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.920]   maybe through some deep breathing,
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.700]   maybe through visualization, maybe you sing a song.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.160]   People do this stuff.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.320]   They use various tools.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.160]   Some people find paying attention to an external stimulus
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.800]   is more helpful.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.380]   Thinking about something, not the experience of the cold.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.780]   Other people find that directly experiencing the cold
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:15.820]   in its most intense form
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.740]   and kind of going into the cold, quote unquote,
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.840]   is the best way to approach it.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.720]   It really varies for people.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.180]   There's no right or wrong way to go about this.
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.100]   But the goal of using cold exposure for stress inoculation
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.800]   and to raise your stress threshold
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.860]   to be able to tolerate heightened levels
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.640]   of real life stress, not the ice bath,
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.400]   but real life stress like work stress
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.160]   and relational stress, et cetera,
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.840]   is by suppressing the activation
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.360]   of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   meaning the alertness or stress system.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.640]   That involves buffering
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.720]   or trying to resist the shiver response.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.000]   The shiver response is an autonomic response
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.080]   designed to generate heat, presumably,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.960]   and actually that is what it does,
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.120]   in order to counter the cold.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.740]   So when you use cold exposure
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.340]   and you're kind of muscling through it
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.100]   or you're learning to relax within it
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.440]   as a form of stress inoculation,
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.560]   that's great and works quite well for that purpose.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.440]   And there's a reason why cold exposure
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.580]   is used in a variety of forms of military stress inoculation,
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.760]   most famous of which, of course,
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.980]   is the Navy Seal Buds Test, really,
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.760]   which is screening procedure for becoming a seal,
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.820]   involves a lot of exposure to cold water.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.320]   However, if you're interested in using cold exposure
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.680]   for fat loss and thermogenesis,
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.580]   you want to do the exact opposite thing.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.920]   There was a paper published in "Nature" two years ago,
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.400]   which showed that cold-induced shiver,
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.360]   the actual physical shiver,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.640]   activates the release of a chemical in the body
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.640]   from muscle called succinate, S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.200]   Succinate travels in the bloodstream
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.880]   and then goes and activates a particular category of fat,
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.020]   not the typical kind of pink or white fat
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.960]   that we think of as like blubber in humans,
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.700]   the stuff that people seem to generally want less of,
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.640]   except for those genetic freaks
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.740]   that seem to have none of it,
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.080]   depending on what they consume.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.160]   Congratulations.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Brown fat is called brown fat
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.400]   because it's actually dark under the microscope.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.100]   It's rich with mitochondria,
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.000]   and it exists mostly between the scapulae
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.080]   and in the upper neck,
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.800]   and it generates thermogenesis and heat in the body.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.980]   It's rich with a certain category of adrenergic receptor.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:44.840]   Incidentally, epinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:50.280]   These brown fat cells increase metabolism.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.620]   It's called brown fat thermogenesis and cause fat burning,
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.880]   burning of other kinds of fat, the pink and white fat.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.780]   So what does this all mean?
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.360]   This means if you want to use the ice bath
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.580]   in order to increase metabolism, shiver away.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.620]   If you want to use the ice bath or cold shower
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.380]   in order to stress inoculate, resist the shiver
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.320]   and learn to stay calm or quote unquote muscle through it.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.900]   Now, I don't know that anyone's ever really talked
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:19.760]   about this publicly because I think the data are so new,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.320]   and I think that people assume that the ice bath
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.200]   or cold exposure is just one thing.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.180]   Here, I've talked about it three ways
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.320]   to shift your circadian rhythm depending on whether
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.960]   or not you're doing it early in the day
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.520]   while your temperature is still rising or at its peak
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.800]   or after that peak in order to extend the perception
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.720]   of your day as continuing and make you want
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.020]   to go to sleep later and wake up later.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.160]   Now, and then the third way, of course,
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.800]   is to either activate brown fat thermogenesis
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.040]   and increase metabolism.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.460]   I suppose the fourth way would be
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:57.460]   to increase stress tolerance or stress threshold, okay?
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:01.100]   But remember, temperature is the effector
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.480]   of circadian rhythms.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.880]   Light is the trigger.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.960]   The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master circadian clock
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.280]   that mediates all these changes,
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.400]   also influenced by non-photic influence like exercise
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.620]   and feeding and things of that sort,
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.300]   but temperature is the effector.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.700]   Now, you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.760]   When you travel and you land in a new location
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.720]   and your schedule is inverted 12 hours,
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.580]   one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.840]   is to get onto the local meal schedule.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.400]   Now, that probably has to do with two effects.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.160]   One are changes in temperature,
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.600]   eating-induced increases in body temperature.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.440]   Now, you should understand why that would work,
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.240]   as well as eating has this anticipatory secretion
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.500]   of hypercretinorexin that I talked about earlier.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.800]   So if this is getting a little too down in the weeds,
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.400]   don't worry about it.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.520]   I will get more into this in episode four
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.800]   of how to shift one's rhythm,
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.560]   but I would love for people to understand
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.360]   that light and temperature are the real heavy-duty levers
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.140]   when it comes to moving your circadian rhythm
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.300]   and sleep times and activity schedules.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.660]   And exercise and feeding can help,
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.420]   but really temperature and light,
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.700]   with light being the primary one,
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.500]   are the most important
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.400]   when it comes to sleep and wakefulness.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.560]   Many people asked questions about food and neurotransmitters
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.660]   and how those relate to sleep, wakefulness, and mood,
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:28.660]   which is essentially 25 hours of content for me to cover,
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.060]   but I'm going to try and distill out
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.420]   the most common questions.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.100]   We've talked a lot about neuromodulators
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:37.060]   like dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.480]   You may notice in those discussions
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:43.220]   that the precursors to say serotonin is tryptophan.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.920]   Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.660]   It comes from the foods that we eat.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.020]   Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.160]   It comes from the foods that we eat.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.440]   And then once we ingest them,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.400]   those compounds circulate
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.040]   to a variety of different cells and tissues,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.640]   but it is true that our food and the particular foods we eat
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.100]   can influence things like neuromodulator levels
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.860]   to some extent, it's not the only way,
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.580]   because there are also enzymes and biochemical pathways
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.460]   that are going to regulate
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.300]   how much tyrosine gets converted into dopamine.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.940]   And there are elements of the dopaminergic neurons,
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.120]   the dopamine neurons themselves that are electrical
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.060]   that have influence on this as well.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.480]   But there are a couple fair assumptions that we can make.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.920]   First of all, nuts and meats, in particular red meats,
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.620]   tend to be rich in things like tyrosine, right?
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.520]   That tells you right there that because
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.240]   tyrosine is the precursor of dopamine
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.840]   and dopamine is the precursor of norepinephrine
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.620]   and epinephrine, that those foods tend to lend themselves
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.820]   toward the production of dopamine and epinephrine
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.960]   and the sorts of things that are associated
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.700]   with wakefulness.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.220]   Now, of course, the volume of food that we eat
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.600]   also impacts our wakefulness.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.440]   If we eat a lot of anything,
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.500]   whether or not it's ribeye, steaks, rice, or cardboard,
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.760]   please don't eat cardboard,
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.900]   your stomach, if it's very distended,
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.180]   will draw a lot of blood into your gut
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.660]   and you will divert blood from other tissues
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.740]   and you'll become sleepy.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.280]   So it's not just about food content,
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.660]   it's also about food volume, all right?
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.780]   Fasting states generally are associated
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.740]   with more alertness, epinephrine, and so forth.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.260]   And fed states are generally associated
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.460]   with more quiescence and relaxation,
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.660]   serotonin and the kind of things that lend themselves
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.180]   more towards sleep and less toward alertness.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.160]   Foods that are rich in tryptophan
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.780]   tend to be things like white meat turkey,
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.060]   also complex carbohydrates.
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.720]   So if you like, you can start experimenting,
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.620]   depending on what foods you eat,
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.060]   you can start experimenting with carbohydrate-rich meals
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.900]   for accessing sleep and more depth of sleep.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.660]   This is actually something that I personally do.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.960]   I tend to eat pretty low carb-ish during the day.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.920]   I actually fast until about noon,
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.520]   not because I have to work to do that,
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.180]   but because I'd rather just drink caffeine
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.860]   and water during that time.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.260]   And then sometime around noon,
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.840]   I can't take it anymore and I'm hungry and I eat,
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.700]   and I try and eat low carb-ish
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.520]   unless I've worked out extremely hard
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.680]   in the previous two hours, which I rarely do,
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.460]   although I do sometimes.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.020]   And that meal is then designed to prolong
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:27.100]   my period of wakefulness into the late afternoon.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.160]   And then sometime around dinnertime,
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.820]   which for me is around 6.30, 7 p.m., 8 p.m.,
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.300]   sometimes as late as 9 p.m.,
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.680]   I tend to eat things like white meat, fish,
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.180]   pastas, rice, and that kind of thing.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:42.200]   My favorite food of all for accessing tryptophan
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.280]   is actually a starch.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.940]   It's actually a vegetable, and it's the croissant,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.660]   which is my favorite vegetable.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.440]   I don't eat those all the time, but I love them,
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.140]   and they seem to increase dopamine as well.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.940]   Never actually done the mass spectrometry on a croissant,
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.220]   but they definitely increase tryptophan
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.680]   and relaxation for me.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.540]   In all seriousness, low carbohydrate/fasted/ketogenic diets
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.520]   tend to lend themselves toward wakefulness
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.380]   by way of increasing epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.620]   adrenaline, dopamine, and things of that sort.
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:16.580]   Carbohydrate-rich meals,
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.020]   and I suppose we should talk about meals as opposed to diet,
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.260]   tend to lend themselves more toward tryptophan, serotonin,
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.260]   and more lethargic states.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.660]   There is very limited evidence that I am aware of
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.340]   that carbohydrates should be eaten at one time a day
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.860]   as it relates to metabolism, et cetera.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:39.140]   I'm sure that will open up a certain amount of debate.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.420]   If you work out very hard and you deplete glycogen,
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.960]   then this all changes.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.300]   So some people are working out very hard
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.880]   in depleting glycogen, other people are not.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.820]   That gets way outside the context
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.460]   of this particular podcast.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:52.940]   But yes, indeed, different foods can bias
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.400]   different neuromodulators and thereby can modulate
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.780]   our waking or our feelings of lethargy and sleepiness.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:06.200]   There are a couple of effects of food that are independent,
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.820]   or I should say a couple of effects of eating,
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:08.760]   'cause the food won't do it
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.920]   when it's sitting across the table,
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.280]   but of eating that are powerful for modulating
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.720]   circadian rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.000]   And that's because every time we eat,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.580]   we get eating-induced thermogenesis
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.960]   regardless of what we eat.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.220]   Now, the eating-induced thermogenesis
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.540]   and increase in metabolism,
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:28.380]   which is an increase in temperature really,
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:33.380]   is probably greatest for amino acid-rich foods like meats,
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.240]   but also other types of foods.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.520]   It's a minimal increase in body temperature
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.800]   compared to say cold exposure or exercise.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.940]   Now, whether or not it's a quarter of a degree
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.080]   or half a degree or a degree,
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.000]   it really depends on the individual.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.360]   And of course there are blood sugar effects.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.420]   There are things like whether or not you are type one
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.460]   or type two diabetic,
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.940]   whether or not you're insulin resistant,
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.240]   whether or not like there's a kid who interns
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.120]   on the podcast here, who's 17 years old,
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.740]   and I'm convinced that he can eat anything.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:09.040]   And he just seems to like burn it up and he's growing it.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.440]   Every time, actually the other day,
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.640]   he walked into the other room and two days later,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.080]   he walked out of the same room.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.320]   He came out in between, of course.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.480]   But, and I was like, he grew, he was like, you know,
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.880]   but he's at that stage where he's just growing.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.720]   Food is going to affect a teenager very differently
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.000]   than it's going to affect a full grown person.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   So, in general, starchy carbohydrates, white meats,
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.900]   such as turkey, some fish, increased tryptophan,
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.400]   therefore serotonin, therefore more lethargic states,
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.340]   more calm.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.640]   Meat, nuts, and there are probably some plant-based foods
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.560]   that I'm not aware of, and I apologize,
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.980]   I should read up on this,
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:50.000]   that also are high in tyrosine that can increase things
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.840]   like dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, alertness.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.420]   So, you can vary these however you like.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.360]   Most people, I think, are eating a variety
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.320]   of these things in given meals.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.580]   And there are other parameters of nutrition
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:03.800]   that are important too.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.920]   Volume of food for the reasons I mentioned before,
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.040]   the volume of food in the gut,
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.980]   less food in the gut, whether or not it's empty
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.000]   or a small amount of food will tend to correlate
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.940]   with wakefulness.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:18.120]   Large volumes of food of any kind will tend to correlate
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.000]   and drive the calming response,
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.080]   and that's by way of this nerve pathway called the vagus.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.100]   We actually have sensory fibers in the gut
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.800]   that communicate to a little protrusion of neurons
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.840]   that sit right next to the juggler
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.460]   called the nodose ganglia, N-O-D-O-S-E.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:37.020]   Unlike Costello, it's nodose, right now he's aldose.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.840]   Nodose actually means having many protrusions,
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.380]   and it's like kind of a lumpy collection of neurons.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.700]   A ganglia is just a collection of neurons,
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:46.240]   and then it goes into the brain stem
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.400]   and then forward in the brain to the areas of the brain
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.780]   that are involved in production of various neuromodulators.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:57.160]   So what we eat and the volume of food
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.240]   are both signaling to the brain.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.180]   It's not just one or the other.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:04.240]   And then there's also this eating-induced thermogenesis,
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.160]   and now you know from the discussion about temperature
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.040]   that if you're eating early in the day,
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   you're tending to shift your rhythm earlier
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.420]   so that you'll want to wake up earlier the next day
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.320]   if you're eating very late in the day,
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.580]   even if you can fall asleep after that,
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.180]   there's a tendency for you to want to sleep
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.680]   later the next day.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.280]   Now, this of course is all going to be constrained
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.720]   by when your kids need to eat
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:25.840]   and when your spouse needs to eat
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.760]   and when your friends need to eat,
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.860]   or if you live alone or what other things you're doing.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.340]   If you're like me and you kind of don't eat until noon
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:32.600]   then eat sometime around noon
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.880]   and then I'm terrible about meals,
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.200]   I just start eating the ingredients
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.160]   while I'm supposed to be cooking
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.600]   and then eventually they're all gone,
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.120]   and I guess that's a meal.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.360]   It varies.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.200]   Some people are neurotically attached
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.280]   to a particular meal schedule.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.100]   Some people are not.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:49.220]   I take my light exposure schedule far more seriously
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.860]   than I take my meal schedule.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.080]   Although in general, I try and eat healthy foods
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.080]   for the most part, croissants included.
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.280]   I was asked several times whether or not
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.040]   men and women or males and females differ
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.100]   in terms of these neurotransmitter phenotypes
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.840]   and the rhythms of sleep and temperature.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.360]   We could probably devote a whole month
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.080]   and we probably will devote an entire month
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.120]   to what are called sex differences
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.960]   because those tend to be related to things
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.020]   we absolutely know like XX or XY chromosomes
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:20.360]   or XYY in some cases or XX chromosomes
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.920]   as opposed to gender, sex and karyotype as we call it,
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.040]   genetic makeup is crystal clear.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.080]   There are things that correlate with one or the other
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.400]   but it's complicated and it's not something
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:38.180]   that's been explored in what I think is enough detail.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:42.200]   Actually recently, I guess it was about five years ago,
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.240]   the National Institutes of Health made it a mandate
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.780]   that all studies use sex as a biological variable
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.360]   and actually explore both sexes of mice,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.500]   both sexes of humans when doing any kind of study
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.340]   because there was a bias towards only using male animals
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:58.680]   or male subjects prior to that time.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.200]   So a lot of data are now coming out
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.600]   revealing important sex differences
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.160]   that I think are going to have powerful impact
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.720]   on health practices, et cetera, response to drugs,
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.740]   response to different sleep schedules, et cetera.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.220]   Perhaps the most salient and obvious one
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.580]   is that during pregnancy,
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:18.420]   females experience a whole range
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.020]   of endocrine and neural effects
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.000]   and we definitely will devote a month
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.620]   to pregnancy and childbirth and child rearing.
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.040]   And for that, I'd really like to bring in some experts.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.060]   I've got terrific colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.100]   that work on these things
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.560]   so that we can go into those in more depth.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.660]   So I'm not blowing off those questions,
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.220]   I'm just kind of pushing them down the road a little bit
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:42.320]   where I can give you a more thorough answer.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.760]   So as we finish up,
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.160]   I just want to offer you the opportunity
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.040]   to do an experiment.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.800]   We've talked about a lot of variables
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.920]   that can impact sleep and wakefulness.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.800]   And in keeping with the theme of the podcast,
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.280]   we are going to continue
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.340]   to talk about sleep and wakefulness and tools for those
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:01.580]   and the science behind those tools as we go forward.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:05.120]   But there are really just four simple parameters
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.440]   that you have control over
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   that you can immediately start to record and take note of,
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.300]   just to see how you're doing with these things.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:18.520]   With no judgment or perhaps no change
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.120]   to what you're actually doing.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.820]   It might be interesting, just a suggestion,
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:26.240]   to write down for each day
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.980]   when you went outside to get sunlight
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   and when you did that relative to waking.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.920]   So you would write down,
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.280]   like the way I do this in my calendar is I'll write down
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.120]   that I don't get exact about it.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.360]   I might say I woke up at 6.15
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.840]   and then I guess I'll put a W 6.15
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.860]   and then SL for sunlight.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.720]   Now you will sometimes get outside right away.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.080]   Other times I'm less good at that
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.000]   and I'll go out around, I don't know, let's say seven.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.480]   And for how long?
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.980]   Maybe like 10, 15 minutes or so.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.680]   And then I'll put a little check
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:59.840]   at roughly the times that I eat my so-called meals.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.680]   Although as I mentioned,
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.640]   sometimes my meals are a bunch of small checks
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.200]   that just kind of extend through the late hours of the day.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.840]   Yours might be more confined to certain times.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:14.160]   And then you might just take note of when you exercised,
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.300]   just put down an E for when you exercise,
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.400]   weight training or aerobic exercise.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.060]   And you might note when you might've felt chilled or cold,
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.760]   if you do, or you might've felt particularly hot,
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.920]   or if you woke up in the middle of the night
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.960]   when you felt particularly hot.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.680]   And then the last thing you might want to do
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.980]   is just write down if and when you did
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:34.640]   a non-sleep deep rest protocol, NSDR protocol,
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.040]   that could be meditation, that could be yoga nidra,
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.520]   that could be hypnosis.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.160]   Anything that you're using to deliberately
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.920]   teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.040]   to more calmness in the waking state,
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.400]   even if it's waking up in the middle of the night
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.100]   and doing an NSDR protocol or in the afternoon
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.600]   or first thing in the morning to recover some sleep
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.400]   and ability to perform DPOs that you might've lost
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.500]   from a minimal or poor night's sleep.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.620]   So you're going to write down when you woke up,
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.320]   when you viewed sunlight,
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.720]   that might be in the morning and the evening
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:05.800]   or just the morning,
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.480]   hopefully it's the morning and the evening,
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:10.440]   when you exercised, when you ate your meals.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.620]   And using a simple record keeping scheme
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:16.280]   like W for waking, SL for sunlight,
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.100]   maybe you come up with a system where it's a check
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.240]   or an X or something for exercise.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.880]   This is not designed to make you neurotically attached
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.880]   to tracking all your behaviors and everything you do.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.680]   I, for instance, don't track what I eat in particular,
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.440]   I kind of know what works for me
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.640]   and I just try and stay within that range.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.080]   But by doing this, you can start to reveal
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.840]   some really interesting patterns.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.920]   Patterns that no answer that I could provide you
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.800]   about any existing tool or protocol could counter.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.480]   It's really about taking the patterns of behaviors
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.840]   of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.800]   and superimposing that on what you're learning
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.040]   in this podcast and elsewhere, of course,
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.400]   and what you already know.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.640]   And trying to see where certain problems
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.000]   or pain points might be arising.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.720]   Maybe you're eating really late in the day
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.520]   and you're waking up in the middle of the night really warm.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.680]   Well, now you would say, well, that could be due
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.840]   to kind of an increase in temperature
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:17.400]   that is extending my day.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.220]   Or maybe you start to find that using cold exposure
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.080]   early in the day is great for you, but using it late,
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.920]   if it's too late in the day, that's not great.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.160]   Or if you're into the sauna or it's even like some people,
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.880]   including myself, if I take a hot shower
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.420]   or sit in a hot tub or a sauna late at night,
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.680]   well, then I get a compensatory decrease in body temperature
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.280]   and I sleep great provided I hydrate well enough
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.000]   'cause that can be kind of a dehydrating thing
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.280]   to sit in hot conditions.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.640]   But if I do the sauna early in the day,
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.720]   unless I exercise immediately afterward,
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.360]   then I tend to get the temperature drop, which makes sense
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.320]   because when you get in the sauna, you get vasodilatation,
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.440]   you throw off a lot of heat,
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.140]   and then you generally get a compensatory drop
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:58.980]   in temperature.
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:37:59.800]   If you do that early in the day,
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.280]   that's right about the time that that temperature
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.960]   is trying to entrain the circadian clocks of your body.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.320]   That's what happens to me.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.080]   Other people, it might be slightly different.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.440]   And some people have more resilient systems than others.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:15.760]   So I just encourage you to start becoming scientists
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.320]   of your own physiology, of your own brain and body
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.640]   and seeing how the various tools
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   that you may or may not be using
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.400]   are affecting your patterns of sleep,
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.720]   your patterns of attention and wakefulness.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.360]   It's vitally important that if you do this,
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.840]   that you know that it's not about trying to get
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.760]   onto an extremely rigid schedule.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.320]   It's really about trying to identify variables
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.320]   that are most powerful for you
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.560]   and that push you in the direction that you want to go
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.720]   and changing the variables that are pushing your body
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.880]   and your mind in the directions that you don't want to go.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.640]   Self-experimentation is something
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.200]   that should be done slowly, carefully.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.000]   You don't want to be reckless about this.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.600]   And this is where I would say manipulating one
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.860]   or two variables at a time is really going to be best
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:02.640]   as opposed to changing a dozen things all at once
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:05.760]   to really identify what it is that's most powerful for you.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.840]   As always, thank you so much for your questions.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.980]   We are going to continue to answer questions.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.220]   I certainly didn't get to all of them,
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:15.440]   but we tried to get to most all of the ones
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.680]   that were frequently asked.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.400]   Episode four of the podcast,
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.400]   I'm going to get into shift work, jet lag
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.320]   and age dependent changes in sleeping
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.420]   and wakefulness and cognition.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:30.480]   So for those of you with kids,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.060]   for those of you that are kids,
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.000]   for those of you with older relatives
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.800]   or who might be older, meaning probably when you start
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.920]   to get into late sixties, seventies and eighties
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.200]   is when there's some marked biological shifts
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.100]   in temperature regulation and things that relate to sleep.
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:49.240]   And for those of you that travel,
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.720]   we're going to talk about jet lag.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.360]   The shift work discussion might seem only relevant
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.480]   to those that work nights, but actually that's not the case.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.600]   Most people, because of the way they're interacting
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:03.040]   with devices, are actually in a form of shift work now
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.600]   where the days are certainly not nine to five
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.000]   so-called banker's hours.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.680]   And then the lights are out at nine
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.560]   and they're asleep until 5 a.m.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.820]   Some people have that schedule, most people do not.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:16.640]   So episode four, we will go deeply into shift work,
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.560]   jet lag, age dependent changes in sleep alertness
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.720]   and cognition, and I will touch back
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.840]   on a few of your questions,
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.720]   but don't think that if your question wasn't answered
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.880]   during these office hours that we won't get to it.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.840]   I absolutely will at some point.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:33.760]   In addition to that, several of you have graciously asked
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.520]   how you can help support the podcast
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.600]   and we very much appreciate that.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.840]   You can support the podcast by liking it on YouTube,
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.780]   by subscribing on YouTube,
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.480]   by recommending the YouTube videos to others,
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.100]   as well as subscribing and downloading the podcast on Apple
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.560]   where you can also leave a review and on Spotify
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.800]   or all three if you like.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.040]   You can also help us by supporting our sponsors.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.500]   So check out some of the sponsor links
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:02.080]   that were described at the beginning of the episode.
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.660]   And in general, recommending the podcast to people
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.080]   that you know and that you think would benefit
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.300]   from the information would be terrific.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:12.000]   As always, I will be continuing to post on Instagram.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.320]   You can expect another podcast episode out next Monday
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.940]   about the topics that we've been discussing this month.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.840]   And above all, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:26.000]   (upbeat music)
