[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Pastor John, we usually serve up specific questions to you, but today I simply want
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.140]   to ask if there's anything from your personal devotions lately that you want
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.500]   to share with us here.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.000]   Tony, just yesterday I was reading in 1 John on my way through the Bible, and
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.440]   I've often said that eternal security is a community project rather than
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.480]   something that's individualistic merely and automatic. God uses means to keep us
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.680]   eternally for himself. It's not like a vaccination against hell. It's more like
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.200]   a committed therapist who unfailingly, this is God unfailingly seeing to it
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.100]   that we hold to the health regimen that brings us to everlasting glory. I totally
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.400]   believe in eternal security. Jesus said, "I give them eternal life. They will never
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.440]   perish. No one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father is great. No one can
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.120]   snatch them out of my Father's hand." But I've also said that this keeping, this
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.040]   divine keeping, is a community project in which God uses people. Exhort one another
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.520]   every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.920]   deceitfulness of sin because we have come to share in Christ if we hold our
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.560]   original confidence firm to the end. So our exhorting one another every day is
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.600]   one of the instruments, one of the means by which God keeps us in Christ to the
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.760]   end of time. So yesterday in 1 John, here's what I read, and I saw that it's
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:00.400]   in a totally fresh way. 1 John 5 16, "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.600]   not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life." So I had never
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.680]   paused to think, "You mean the life that we need to make it to the
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.000]   end, the eternal life, is given when I see a brother sinning and I pause and I
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.480]   ask God, 'Oh God, bring him to repentance, bring him to the point of confession,' and
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.840]   God will use that prayer as a means of preserving that person's eternal life. So
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.400]   there is a kind of sinning that shows God has given a person over to depravity.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480]   John tells us that. There is sinning that is that is unto death. It's like Esau's
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.440]   sin in Hebrews 12 17. He sought repentance and he couldn't find it even
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.040]   though he sought it with tears, which is a fearful prospect that we could ever
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.600]   sin so long God would just give us up. But 1 John is mainly devoted to
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   helping us see that there is sin that is not unto death. We write these things to
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.520]   you that you may not sin, but if anyone does sin, we have an advocate. That's
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   chapter 2 verse 1, "Or if we confess our sins, he's faithful and just and will
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.760]   forgive our sins." So John is so eager to help Christians not despair that if they
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   sin, they are proving themselves to be unregenerate. And what I hadn't
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.240]   noticed before in 1 John is that God says one of the means by which he will
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.360]   preserve us in Christ is when we pray for each other. If anyone sees his
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.880]   brother committing a sin not leading to death, he'll ask and God will give him
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.760]   life. So eternal life is sure for the bride of Christ and for those who
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.600]   are called and justified, but it's not automatic like a vaccination. It
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.640]   involves exhortations from Hebrews 3 and it involves prayers like this
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.440]   one in 1 John 5:16. And then just as I was pondering that, the Lord brought to
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.280]   mind James 5:20 where it says, "Let him know that whoever brings back a
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.440]   sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death." And I thought, "Okay,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.120]   how do you bring back a sinner from wandering?" And you do it at least in
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.720]   those two ways, don't you? Hebrews 3, exhort him and 1 John 5:16,
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   pray for him and the Lord will give him life. So here's the personal impact it
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.400]   had on me. I'm out here in the middle of nowhere in Tennessee and that's a scary
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   place to be, isn't it? Because this says, in essence, don't separate yourselves
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   from the very people who could be the means of your life, be the means of your
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.520]   preservation. So I just hope that everyone who's listening to this won't
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.680]   leave the fellowship of believers. They'll keep themselves grafted in to
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.920]   believers who can pray for them, that they won't lose their life, and who will
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.960]   exhort them to hold true to the end, and that they'll do that for others. And I
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.160]   hope people will pray for me, that God will reveal to me any sins that I
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.080]   may have in my family or in relationships, that if I spot them, I
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.120]   could repent of them, get forgiveness for them, and thus be preserved.
