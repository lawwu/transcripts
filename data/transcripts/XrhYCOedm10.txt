[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Welcome back to the podcast on this holiday week.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.480]   Tomorrow's Thanksgiving for us here in the States and in Canada, and we'd like to take
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.040]   these moments to take up the theme of Thanksgiving in the Apostle Paul's letters, which is a
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.520]   major theme for him.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   Last Thanksgiving, a year ago, I mentioned that the Apostle Paul mentions thanks about
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.680]   50 times in his epistles, leading to one of my favorite quotes, a claim by New Testament
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.560]   scholar David Powell, who once wrote, and he's quoting Paul Schubert here, "The Apostle
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.480]   Paul mentions the subject of Thanksgiving more frequently per page than any other Hellenistic
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   author, pagan, or Christian."
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.000]   Thanksgiving was always on Paul's lips, and it was on his lips when he was talking about
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360]   prayer and anxiety, too.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.360]   In Philippians 4, verse 6, Paul writes this, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.240]   to God."
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.680]   In other words, pray your way past anxiety and pray your way into Thanksgiving.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.960]   Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.780]   Let's go to chapter 4, verses 6 and 7.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:42.080]   Very famous, very precious, and more embedded in the big picture of this letter than you
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   may have thought.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.840]   I want to draw out from verses 6 and 7 of chapter 4 how it relates to the big things
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.800]   Paul is trying to do in this letter.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.520]   So now, finally, for the first time, he exhorts them to pray.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.660]   I think that's been implicit so far, but now it's explicit.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.620]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, that's a big word.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.220]   Do you pray about everything?
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.620]   Everything?
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:29.700]   I mean, when Paul says, "Pray without ceasing," that probably is connected to praying everything.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.220]   Do you walk in a spirit of communion with God that sometimes consciously, sometimes
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:50.300]   less so, is constantly offering up thanks, but especially sending up need?
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.220]   I need help in this conversation.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.140]   I can barely understand that person's accent, and my hearing is bad.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.260]   I need help right now at the dining room table.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.580]   You live like that?
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:15.340]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:26.620]   let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.580]   will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:43.140]   In one sense, this command to pray is all-encompassing because of the words, "In everything."
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.100]   Do not be anxious about anything, anything, but in everything, pray.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.660]   See the connection there?
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.180]   Don't be anxious in anything because in everything, you're praying for what you need in the anxious
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.580]   moment, and you're trusting God because of his promise to be there and help, and so anxiety
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.580]   lifts.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.300]   That's the way prayer is supposed to work, take away anxiety.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.540]   In another sense, it's not broad and all-encompassing.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.660]   It's very narrow and very focused because instead of saying the hundred things that
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.180]   God does in answer to prayer, he simply focuses on two things, which are really two sides
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.460]   of the same coin.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.460]   Do not be anxious is one result of prayer.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.180]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, let your requests
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.180]   be made known to God.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.540]   So the first thing that happens when you pray about everything is anxiety is lifted.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.060]   Cast all your anxieties on me because I care for you.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.980]   That's Peter's way of saying it in 1 Peter 5.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:05.500]   And the second thing is the peace of God, which is the opposite of anxiety, right?
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.740]   The peace of God that passes all understanding comes in and takes over and protects, guards
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.120]   your hearts and minds.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.620]   So negatively, aim by prayer to be done with anxiety and positively, aim by prayer in everything
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.140]   to enjoy constant peace.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:43.740]   Walk through the world of trouble, ministry troubles, family troubles, European troubles,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.280]   refugee troubles, political troubles, financial troubles.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:58.580]   Walk in the protection of the peace of God that cannot be accounted for by human reason.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.420]   Cannot.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.780]   It goes beyond.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.900]   It surpasses what human reasoning can do.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.020]   When Paul is saying, "Enjoy peace through prayer," if somebody says, "Yeah, but how
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.900]   can you have peace when that's happening?"
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.900]   Well, that word "how" has no answer humanly.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.340]   That's why it says, "Beyond human understanding."
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.700]   Human understanding will not be able to come up with an answer to how you enjoy peace in
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.860]   this circumstance.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.780]   It is supra-rational.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.720]   Reasoning doesn't make the peace happen.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.060]   God makes the peace happen.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.060]   And he does it in answer to prayer.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.220]   It's a wonderful experience.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.300]   Now let's ask this.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:01.020]   How do those two halves of verse 6 and 7, "Get rid of anxiety by prayer, enjoy peace
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:08.340]   with God by prayer," how do those two results of praying in everything relate to the big
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.020]   picture of Philippians, which we've been seeing?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:23.940]   So the first day I argued from chapter 1, verse 20, "My eager expectation and hope is
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.940]   that I might not at all be ashamed, but that Christ might be magnified in my body, whether
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.820]   I live or whether I die, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.620]   That's the big goal of this letter.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:50.740]   Christ magnified in your bodily existence, living or dying.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.500]   Make him look great.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.840]   That's the reason you're on the planet.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.300]   That's the reason your family exists, your ministry exists.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.460]   Make Christ look magnificent because that's what he is.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:12.060]   That's what this big picture is in Philippians.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.020]   And we saw that Paul gets very specific.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.580]   Another way of describing "make Christ look great" is "lead lives worthy of the gospel."
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.340]   Chapter 1, verse 27.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:36.500]   That is, "A life that is fearless before the adversary and united arm in arm in love with
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.660]   other believers."
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:49.100]   Unity in love and fearlessness, he says, "become a sign," verse 28, "a sign to the world of
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.740]   their destruction and of your salvation."
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:09:00.160]   In other words, when you are fearless before your adversary and you are full of love, driven
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.220]   by humility, counting others more significant than yourself, putting others' interests
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.100]   before your own, when that's the source of the loving unity and the fearlessness, it's
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.100]   a sign.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:22.120]   It's a sign to the world that Christ is all satisfying to these people.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.760]   Christ will meet every need that they have.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.280]   Christ is all they need.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.200]   I want to know about this because I don't get it.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   That's the big picture.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.760]   How does that relate to the praying of chapter 4, verse 6?
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.840]   Can you put it together?
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Pretty obvious now, I think.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.240]   If I were teaching you a class, I would make you write the answer.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:10:01.480]   The answer is, "Do not be anxious about anything," is the fearlessness of 127 and 28.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:09.600]   The fearlessness of chapter 1, verse 28, before the adversary is another word for "toad be
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.760]   anxious."
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.040]   When you stand before the authorities in the university or the authorities in the capital,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:24.160]   when you stand before people who don't like your position on this or that, don't be afraid.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:31.120]   Or to use the words of chapter 4, verse 6, "Don't be anxious about anything, but in everything,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.480]   let him know what you need."
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.800]   All of which goes to say, "Prayer is the key to this book."
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.240]   Yeah, interesting to see prayer all over the book.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.880]   So don't be anxious.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.160]   Pray thanksgiving to God.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's a connection I had not seen previously, and it was made in a sermon Pastor John preached
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   on May 25, 2016, in Wysla, Poland, of all places.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Wysla, Poland.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.240]   It's titled "Prayer, How to Do the Humanly Impossible."
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.640]   The whole thing is online.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:10.080]   Well, on behalf of Pastor John and the staff at Desiring God, we pray that you have a day
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.540]   full of gratitude to God for his abundant mercies to us.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.080]   We have a lot to be thankful for, not least of which for our Savior, Jesus Christ, and
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.880]   for our forgiveness and our life that we have in union with him.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   We'll see you Friday.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.380]   Amen.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:38.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
