[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We apologise for the poor sound quality during the following sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   This was due to a deterioration of the original recording
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   and although it has been digitally restored to improve audibility,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   we trust that it will not spoil your enjoyment of this sermon by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter and the first verse.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "Pray an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus."
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I call your attention to this verse not only because it is the first verse in this epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   but also because it enables me to say that I propose, God willing, to deal with this great epistle,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   to study it with you and to consider together its mighty message.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I never believe in planning these matters and therefore I am not going to announce
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   that I propose to work right through the epistle from beginning to end,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   but at any rate, we are certainly starting upon it and we are going to try to delve into its riches
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   as God will bless us and lead us and guide us.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Now as we approach this epistle, I am free to confess that I do so with a sense of considerable temerity.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   This is an epistle which is very difficult to speak of in a controlled manner
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   because of its greatness and because of its sublimity.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Many have tried to describe this epistle.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It has called forth efforts on the part of large numbers of Christian people throughout the centuries.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Some have described it like this.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   One has said that it is the crown and the climax of Pauline theology.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Another has said that it is the distilled essence of the Christian religion,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   the most authoritative and most consummate compendium of our holy Christian faith.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What language!
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And I suggest to you that it is not exaggerated language,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   far be it from me to try to compete with those who have described this epistle in that way.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And yet it seems to me that any adequate general description of this epistle must pay attention
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and must take note of and include certain words which are so characteristic of the epistle
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and which the apostle uses in this epistle more frequently perhaps than in any other epistle.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So were I to attempt a definition I should say something like this,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   that in this epistle the apostle exalts in and marvels at the glory and the mystery
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and the riches of God's way of redemption in Christ.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Those are the words, as I hope to show you, that he uses so frequently.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The glory of it all, the mystery and the riches of God's way of redemption in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Or another way in which I think the truth about this great epistle can be stated is this,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   that it is a letter in which the apostle looks at the Christian salvation from the vantage point of the heavenly places.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Now in other epistles, indeed in all his epistles, he is always expanding and explaining and manifesting the great way of salvation,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   but so often he does so from our standpoint and that is very essential.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And he deals with particular doctrines or he deals with arguments or with controversies that have arisen.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The peculiar feature and characteristic of this particular epistle is that the apostle seems to be,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   as he puts it himself, in the heavenly places and he is looking down at the great panorama of salvation and of redemption from that particular point.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The result is that there is very little controversy in it,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   because his great concern here was to give to these Ephesians and others to whom the letter is addressed,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   this panoramic view of this wondrous and glorious work of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Now Luther says of the epistle to the Romans that it is the most important document in the New Testament.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And I suppose in many ways that is the simple truth.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   The epistle to the Romans, says Luther, is the most important document in the New Testament.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It is the place in which the gospel is found in its purest expression.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And there he is certainly right.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   There is no purer, plainer statement of the gospel or expression of the gospel than in the epistle to the Romans.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, if that is true, I would venture to say this,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   that if the epistle to the Romans is the purest expression of the gospel,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   the epistle to the Ephesians is the sublimest and the most majestic expression of it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You notice I am not saying the purest, because I don't think it is the most direct expression.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   In Romans there is really only one great theme,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   and that is that theme of justification by faith and its implications.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Here the standpoint, the viewpoint is a wider one and is a larger one.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   If that is the purest, this is the sublimest and certainly the most majestic.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   There are, as you all are familiar with it, statements and passages in this which rarely do a baffled description.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The great apostle piles epithet upon epithet, adjective upon adjective.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   His superlatives are all used and exhausted and still he can't express himself.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There are passages like that in this first chapter,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and there are certainly passages and statements like that in that third chapter and especially towards the end,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   where the great apostle is carried out of himself and above and beyond himself
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and just loses himself and abandons himself in a great act of worship and of praise and of thanksgiving.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I say therefore that there is nothing more sublime in the whole range of scripture
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   than this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Now this morning I am anxious that we should take a general view of it.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We shall then of course come on to the details, but it's always good to take a general view first.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Indeed there is a sense in which it can be said that we can only truly grasp and understand the particulars
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   if we have taken a firm grasp of the whole and of the general.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   But we are not going to stop at the general.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   People who think that by giving a rough division of the message of this epistle according to chapters
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that they have therefore dealt with it and can move on to another just displaying their sad ignorance.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It's when you come to the details of this epistle you really discover the wealth.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   A mere general view of it and summary of its message.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's all right as a beginning, but that's a mere beginning and introduction.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's as I say you come down to these particular statements and these almost words, individual words
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that the real glory of it all becomes displayed to our wandering gaze.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   But I say we start with the general this morning.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Now what is the theme of this epistle?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What is it about?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Well in a sense in my general definition I've already answered that question.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   But let me put it rather like this.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's all suggested it seems to me here at once in this first verse.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That is again something very characteristic of the apostle.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   He could never control himself, he couldn't restrain himself.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He immediately proceeded with his theme.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Paul he says an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And there you are.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   What is the theme of this epistle?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   First and foremost it is God.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   God the Father.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Grace be unto you he goes on to say in the second and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That's it, that's the theme.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Now this is how the apostle Paul always begins.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And this is how every Christian should begin.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   This is the thing of course that controls everything else.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   There was never any danger of the apostle Paul forgetting this.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   For he of all men as he is reminded us in the epistle to the Romans knows that
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   it is from God and to God and unto God and by God are all things to whom be glory for ever and ever.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   The Bible is God's book.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's a revelation of God.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And the whole of our Christian thinking must start with God.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Oh how often have we been at pains to emphasize this.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That most of the trouble in the church today is due to the fact that we are all so subjective.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   We all start with ourselves.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We are so interested in ourselves.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   We are egocentric.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   That's the curse of this present century and of this generation that having forgotten God
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   we are so interested in ourselves that we are miserable and wretched quarrelling with one another
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   all because we have forgotten God.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And the whole message of the Bible from beginning to end is to bring men back to God
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and to humble us before God and to enable us to see our true relationship to God.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well now this is the great theme of this epistle.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It just holds us face to face with God and what God is and what God has done.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It emphasizes throughout the glory and the greatness of God.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   God the eternal, God the everlasting, God over all.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The indescribable glory of God and greatness of God.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's all here.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You notice how it comes out constantly in various phrases that he uses
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   according to the good pleasure of his will.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   which he has purposed in himself.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's all in him.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   In whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   God, the eternal and everlasting God, self-sufficient in himself from eternity to eternity,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   needing no one, needing the aid of no one,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   living, dwelling in his own everlasting, absolute and eternal glory.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   God.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   That's the great theme of this epistle.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   We don't start, I say, by microscopically examining ourselves and our needs and the provision.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   No, no, you start there with God. You forget yourself.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You are taken as it were by the hand in this epistle
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and you are told that you are going to be given this great view of something of the glory and the majesty of God.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That is why I say as we approach this study
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I feel that a voice comes to us as it came of old to Moses at the burning bush and says,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground."
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   We are ushered into the presence of God in all his glory and in all his greatness.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   But not only that, we are at once face to face with the sovereignty of God.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   These are the great terms, are they not, which you find constantly running through the scriptures.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   These are the great words in terms of Christian doctrine and of Christian theology.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Oh, how little we have heard of them in this present century.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   With our morbid, preoccupied subjectivism,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   how little have we been told about the glory and the greatness and the majesty and the sovereignty of God,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   the attributes of God.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Our forefathers delighted in these terms.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   These were the terms of three hundred years ago,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   the terms of the Puritans and the Covenanters.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   They delighted to try to understand and to contemplate the attributes of God.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And here is one of the most extraordinary, the sovereignty of God,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   the everlasting sovereignty of God over all.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You notice the apostle comes to it at once.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Paul, he says, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Not by his own will.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   He didn't call himself, and the churches didn't call him.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   It was God who called him.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   He is an apostle by the will of God.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Indeed, he puts this very specifically in his epistle to the Galatians, you remember,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   where he says, "When it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   and called me by his grace to reveal his Son in me."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   It is God who has done it.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   The sovereignty of God.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And as we go on through this great epistle,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   we shall find it standing out in all its glory and its magnificence everywhere.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   It is God who has chosen everyone who is a Christian in Christ.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   It is God, he says, who has predestinated us.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   It is a part of God's purpose that we should be saved.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   There never would have been salvation if God had not thought of it,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   if God had not planned it, if God had not put it into execution.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It is God who said, "Love the world."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   It is God who sent forth his own Son, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It is all of God.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   God's purpose.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It is according to his own purpose.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It is according to the counsel of his own will that all these things have happened.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   My friends, this epistle reminds us everywhere that that's the way to start thinking about Christianity.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   You don't start here and then go up.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   You start there and come down.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's all from God.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   It is the sovereignty of God who is over all.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Now, we shall find, I say, as we work through it,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   that not only is salvation entirely from God in general,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   it is so in particular.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Take, for instance, that great theme which he works out in the third chapter.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   The special thing he tells that in a sense has been committed to him as an apostle is this,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "By the revelation he made known unto me the mystery."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   What is the mystery?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Well, it is this, that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   You see, it's God who controls everything, the time element in particular.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Have you ever thought, as you read through your Old Testament,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   of why it was that all those centuries had to pass before the Son of God actually came?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Why was it for so long that only the Jews, the Israelites, had the oracles of God
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   and an understanding that there is only one true and living God?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Then God decided that the time had come, the fullness of the times had arrived,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   so he reveals this thing, whichever to have been a secret, it is now revealed.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But not until this point.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And here is but another illustration, I say, of the sovereignty of God.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Known unto God and unto him alone are all his ways.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   He determines every point, every issue, everything that happens.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And as you work through this epistle, you will find that the apostle constantly recurs to that theme,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   God over all, deciding all, controlling all, and timing everything in this most extraordinary manner.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I know of nothing at a time like this which is so comforting and reassuring
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   as to know that the Lord still reigneth, that he is still the sovereign Lord of the universe,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and that though the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   yet hath he set his sun upon his holy mount of Zion,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   and the day will come when all his enemies shall lick his shoes and his footstool,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and be humbled before him, and Christ shall be all in all the sovereignty of God.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   It's here in this introduction, repeated, repeated, and repeated, it's everywhere,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   because it is indeed one of the cardinal doctrines without which we really do not understand our Christian faith.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And then, of course, he must of necessity go on having said that to deal with the mystery of God
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and of his greatness and of his majesty and of his sovereignty.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   This word "mystery" is used five times in this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He never uses it more than twice in any other epistle.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   So that I think I'm justified in saying that it is one of the major themes of this epistle,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   the mystery of God's ways with respect to men, the mystery of his will.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We've got it in this very first chapter.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   We shall go on, I say, finding it having made known unto us, he says,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I wonder whether we always realise this as we should.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Oh, how often do even Christian people approach some of these great truths and doctrines and say,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   "But I don't understand this." My dear friend, you should never have tried to.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   If you start by thinking you can understand the mind and the will and the way of God,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I say you might as well give up at this moment. I announce it's a mystery.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's inscrutable. It's the mind of the eternal and the everlasting.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   No mind of men can ever cope with this.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   No man has guided God. He's consulted nobody. Nobody can understand him.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Oh, if you try to understand God's ways with respect to men and the world,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I assure you, you'll find yourself involved in things that are quite inscrutable
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and you'll be miserable and unhappy and you may end by losing your faith
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and complaining against God and having a sense of grudge against him.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But oh, the folly of trying to do that, the mystery of his will.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   He is infinite, eternal. We are finite and sinful.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   We don't see, we don't understand. You say, "God isn't fair," if that is true.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   My dear friend, put your hand with joy upon your mouth and realize what you're saying
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   and of whom you're speaking. The mystery of his will.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   But surely, to object to the mystery is almost to deny that we are Christian at all.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Is there anything more wonderful, more entrancing, more glorious for the Christian
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   than to be looking into the mystery?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Oh, I trust that as I'm speaking to you, you're already filled with a sense of divine expectation
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   as you propose to come with me as we look into the mysteries
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and have another view and see something further and yet go on.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Isn't that the great charm of the Christian life?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Isn't that why it's the most romantic life in the world today?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   You ever go on, you think you know it all, you turn a corner and you see something you didn't know
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and on and on you go. It's all here, the riches of his grace.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But it's all a glorious mystery, which he has been pleased to reveal to us by his Holy Spirit.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   But God forbid that we should ever imagine that we'll be able to understand
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   in the sense of fully comprehending it all.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   I'm not here to produce some kind of theodicy or defense of God.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I am here rather to unfold the mystery and to lead us to a reverent attitude
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   that we may look at it and worship him and confess our finitude and our ignorance
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and our smallness and our frailty and thank him for the mystery of his holy will.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And then the next thing of course is the grace of God.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   This word is used thirteen times in this epistle, the grace of God.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   The apostle I say goes on repeating it, he can't help himself.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Indeed in the second verse he started with it, "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Oh, this is the thing I suppose that above everything else is displayed in this great epistle.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   God's amazing grace to sinful men, the way he has visited us,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   the way he has provided this means of salvation and of redemption.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   The grace of God, yes, and the abundance of it in particular.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   The riches of his grace, again a word which he uses more here than anywhere else,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   the riches of his grace.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   My dear friends, in this epistle we are looking into the riches, the abundance,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   the super abundance of God's grace towards us.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   If you don't look forward to an examination and an investigation of this with the keenest possible anticipation,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   well then I say it is time that we ask ourselves the question as to whether we are Christians at all.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   We are all interested in wealth and in riches.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   We like to go and visit museums and other places where these things are kept and are stored.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   We look at gems and at pearls.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   We'll stand in queues.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   We'll pay great prices to go in to see the wealth and the riches.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   We boast of it as individuals and as nations, riches.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Well I say the supreme object of this epistle in a sense is to lead us in
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and to give us a view and a glimpse of the riches, the abundant, super abundant riches of the grace of God.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Oh yes, it all starts with God.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   God the Father who is over all.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   But then, having said that, we come on to what invariably comes next in all the epistles of this writer indeed,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   to that which is always second in the whole of the Bible.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Did you notice it in the beginning as I read how the name, the name that was so dear and blessed to the apostle keeps on coming in?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   He is an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And on and on it goes.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   You see in the first verse he tells us at once he is an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   My friends, it sounds so utterly ridiculous to have to say it, doesn't it?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And yet it is essential today.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   There is no gospel and there is no salvation apart from Jesus Christ.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Is it necessary to say that it is?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   There are people who can talk even about Christianity without Christ.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   They talk about forgiveness but the name of Christ isn't mentioned.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   They mention the love of God and the pity of God.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ doesn't come in.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Not so the apostle Paul.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   There is no gospel, there is no salvation apart from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   The gospel in particular is about him.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   All God's gracious purposes are carried out by Christ, in Christ, through Christ, from beginning to the very end.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Everything that God in his sovereign will and by his infinite grace and according to the riches of his mercy and the mystery of his will,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   everything that God has planned and purposed and carried out for our salvation he has done in Christ.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   In him God has treasured up all the riches of his grace and of his wisdom.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Everything, I say, from the very beginning to the very end is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   There is no Christian message apart from him.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   We are called and chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   We are reconciled to God, how? By the blood of Christ. Listen to it.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   We are all interested in forgiveness.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   How am I forgiven? Is it because I repent and ask God to forgive me and say I'm sorry and God looks upon me and loves me
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and forgives me? I say no.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   With reverence I assert it again that even the almighty God cannot forgive man's sin like that.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   There is only one way whereby God forgives us.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   It is because he sent his only begotten Son from heaven to earth and to the agony and the shame and the death of the cross
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   in whom we have redemption through his blood.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   There is no Christianity without the blood of Christ.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's central, it's absolutely essential, there's nothing without it.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Not only the person of Christ, in particular his death, his shed blood, his atoning substitutionary sacrifice.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It is in that way and that way alone that we are redeemed.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Oh Christ is absolutely central in this epistle.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   We shall find it as we come to the details.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   He is everywhere, he must be, called in him, chosen in him, saved by his blood in him.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   That's our standing in a position.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   He is the head of the church as this very first chapter reminds us.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He is put far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   not only in this world but also in that which is to come.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   He is the head of the church, the body, the fullness of him that filleth all and be in all.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And there he is this morning at the right hand of God with all authority and power in heaven and in earth,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Jesus our Lord, supreme, the son of God, the saviour of the world.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   That's going to be our theme.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Aren't you beginning to look forward to it?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   To look at him, to gaze upon him in his person, in his offices, in his work, in all that he is and can be to us.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   The father, the son.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And then of course in particular as I've already been anticipating in a way, God's great purpose in Christ.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   That is the practical theme of this epistle.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Here it is in the tenth verse that in the dispensation of the fullness of times.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Don't you like words like that?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You know I rather like saying them.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   They give me a real thrill.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   I know of nothing like them.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   But in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather, he God might gather in one,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   That's the purpose.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And then of course the apostle goes on to tell us why this has ever been necessary.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And that is of course because of sin.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   In the second chapter we shall find how he tells us that all the human problems that are harassing the minds and the hearts of men this morning
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   are due to one fact only and it is this.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   He tells us why God's plan of redemption is necessary.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's all because of the fall of men.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Yes, preceded by the fall of that bright angelic spirit called the devil or Satan who has become the God of this world,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   the prince of the power of the air.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   There it is and he shows us the agony and the enmity and the fight and the havoc that has been wrought in the human race.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Men and women are divided and separated.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   The modern world is torn asunder, divided up into rival factions.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   The ancient world was exactly the same.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Indeed it's been like that ever since men fell.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   You get it in Cain and Abel at once you see.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   There's nothing new about all this.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   It's rebellion against God.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   It's the loss of that relationship.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   It's man setting himself up as a God that causes all these disruptions.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And there you are taken back to the very beginning and are shown the paradise that God had made in a state of chaos.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And God announces his plan and begins to put it into practice.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And the Old Testament you see is just an account of how God began to work this out.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   First of all, he separated unto himself the people called the Jews.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   There is his purpose of redemption.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Out of this welter, out of this mess of mankind, he forms a people for himself.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   He calls a man named Abram, turns him into a nation, gathers these people.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   They are his special people.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   They stand alone like an island in a great raging ocean.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   God's people, God's plan.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   There is the beginning of something new.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Ah yes, but there was great rivalry and jealousy between the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Here I say one of the major themes is how God has taken all this a stage and a step further.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   The great thing that has been revealed to me, says Paul, is that not only the Jews but the Gentiles also.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   The middle wall of partition is gone.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   The two are to be made one new men and will approach God by one spirit.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   The Gentiles also are coming in.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   There is a new creation, a new man.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   There is something new coming to being.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's called the church.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And this is to go on, says the apostle, until again when the fullness of time shall have arrived,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   the world will end it all and all that is inimical to him shall be destroyed and everything in heaven and earth
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and everywhere else shall be one in Christ.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   That's one of the major themes of this epistle.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Jews only, then Jews and Gentiles, then everything.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And all is to be done in and through Christ.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But that in turn leads to the other major theme which is the church.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   God's purpose is seen most plainly and clearly in and through the Christian church.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   It is in the church that you see this great purpose of God, of bringing together all things in Christ.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Here we are this morning, different people, different nationalities,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   come from different parts of the world with different experiences, different in appearances,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   different in our psychology and in every conceivable respect.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   And yet we are one, you see, one in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Well, this is but an example, a pattern, an illustration.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   This is what God is doing until finally there shall be that new heavens and new earth
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   wherein dwelleth righteousness and Jesus shall reign from shore to shore
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   and moon shall wax and wane no more.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   But to me it's a very thrilling and a very wonderful thing to see the church in that light
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and to see therefore the importance of being a member of the Christian church
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and the privilege and the responsibility of being a member of the Christian church.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It is because of this, says Paul, that you must live the Christian life.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   From chapters 4 to the end he comes down to the practicalities, the ethical behavior,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   the conduct that is expected of such people.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Why? Well, because that's what they are.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   They are in the plan and the purpose of God and there are manifestations of it.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Therefore, they for God's sake must manifest it in their daily life and living.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   That's his argument.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   That's why the ethical appeal must come in at the end.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   That's all you see in terms of the nature of the church and the realization of God's glorious purpose.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Well, very well.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   There I've given you a very hurried review of the great themes of this epistle.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   As I close, let me put it like this in a very simple and practical form.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Why am I calling your attention to all this and why do I propose to do so?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It is because I am profoundly convinced that the greatest need of every one of us is to know these truths.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   It is, I say, because we all need to look again at the glorious revelation.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   It is because we need to be delivered from our morbid preoccupation with ourselves.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   If we but saw ourselves as we are depicted in this epistle, what a difference it would make.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   If we but realized, as the apostle says here in this prayer of his,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   where he prays that we may know what is the hope of our calling
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   would that believe, weak, miserable and happy Christian,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   feeling that the fight is too much for you
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and you are on the point of giving up and giving in and going out,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   if you only knew the power that is working mightily for you.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   It is the same power that brought Christ from the dead.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Oh, our lives would be revolutionized at once if we but realized it,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   if we but knew that we are meant to be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   We would no longer be weak and ailing and complaining.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   We would no longer present such sorry pictures of the Christian life
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   to those who know us and who live round and about us.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   What we need, my friends, is not some experience, but to realize what we are,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   who we are, what God has done in Christ, where he has placed us.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   We don't realize our privileges. That's our trouble.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Our greatest need is still the need of understanding.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Our prayers for ourselves should be the prayer of the Apostle for these people,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   That's what we need, understanding.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And here it is, here are the riches displayed.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Let's enter in and look at them and take hold of them and enjoy them.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And above all, perhaps at the time like this,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   how vital it is, I say, that we should have some new and fresh and deeper understanding
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   of God's great plan and purpose for the world.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   With international conferences taking place almost on our doorstep,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   with the whole world wondering as to what its future is to be
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and what the outcome of it all is going to be.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Seeing men at the end of their wits and at the end of their tether,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   patching up agreements here and there,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   and yet with no much confidence in any of it or all of it.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   What a tremendous thing it is to stand and look at this revelation
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   and see God's plan and purpose behind it all and beyond it all.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And it isn't being done through statesmen, it's being done through people like you and myself.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   The world ignores it and laughs at it and mocks it.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   But we ought to know for certain this morning that all principalities and power and might and dominion
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   and every name that is named not only in heaven, in this world, but also in that which is to come,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   have been set beneath his feet.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Who was rejected by this world when he came into it
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and dismissed as this fellow, this carpenter.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   But who was the son of God and the savior of the world,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   the king of kings, the lord of lords,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   the one at whose name every knee shall bow,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Thanks be unto God for the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   for the riches of God's grace. Amen.
