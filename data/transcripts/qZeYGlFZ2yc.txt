[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]   I like to tell myself, I'm just going to do the thing for two minutes, and then I'm going
[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.180]   to stop doing the thing.
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.520]   So I've got a couple of songs on my Spotify playlist, which are like two minutes long,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   like instrumental songs.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.400]   I just like I, if I, yeah, I will just like put on one of the songs, I'd be like, I'm
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.780]   just gonna do this thing until the end of the song.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040]   And usually the song ends, the next one plays on shuffle, and I don't even realize that
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.560]   I've just continued doing the thing.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.280]   Occasionally, I just do it for two minutes, and then I stop and I think, cool, that's
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   fine.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's not my day.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.500]   But I say 90% of the time, as long as I can just talk myself into doing it for two minutes,
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.960]   then I'm, I'm unlikely to stop doing it because once I've gotten to the swing of things, it's
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.000]   a lot easier to get started.
