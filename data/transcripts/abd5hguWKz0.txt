[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Most people, most of the time, are polite,
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.800]   cooperative, and kind, until they're not.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.420]   - The following is a conversation with Rick Spence,
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.160]   a historian specializing in the history
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   of intelligence agencies, espionage, secret societies,
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.640]   conspiracies, the occult, and military history.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.560]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.400]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Rick Spence.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.440]   You have written and lectured about serial killers,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.560]   secret societies, cults, and intelligence agencies,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.040]   so we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.360]   But let's begin with intelligence agencies.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.560]   Which has been the most powerful
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.680]   intelligence agency in history?
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.520]   - The most powerful intelligence agency in history.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   I mean, it's an interesting question.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   I'd say probably in terms of historical longevity
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   and consistency of performance,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.640]   that the Russian intelligence services,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.760]   notice I didn't say the KGB specifically,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.440]   but the Russian intelligence services,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680]   going back to the czarist period,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.440]   are consistently pretty good.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.600]   Not infallible. None of them are.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.160]   Of course, there's a common Western way
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.560]   of looking at anything Russian.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.520]   Very often, I think it's still the case,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640]   Russians are viewed in one of two ways.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.800]   Either they are bumbling idiots,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.160]   or they are diabolically clever.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   No sort of middle ground.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.440]   And you can find both of those examples in this.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.200]   So what I mean by that is that if you're looking
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.960]   at the modern SVR or FSB,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   which are just two different organizations
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   that used to be part of the one big KGB,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.440]   or the KGB or its predecessors, the Cheka,
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   you're really going back to the late 19th century
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   and the Imperial Russian Intelligence Security Service,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.000]   generally known as the Okrana or Okranka.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.040]   It's really the Department of Police,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.360]   the special corps of gendarmes.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.400]   Their primary job was protecting the imperial regime
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.960]   and protecting it against imperial,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.680]   or rather interior enemies,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.520]   revolutionaries for the most part.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   And they got very, very good at that.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.280]   By co-opting people within those movements,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   infiltrating and recruiting informers,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   agent provocateurs.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   In fact, they excelled at the agent provocateur.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480]   Person you place inside an organization
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120]   and it costs trouble.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   Usually maneuver them into a position of leadership
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.120]   and they provoke actions that can then allow you
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.160]   to crack down on them.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.880]   That is, many sort of lure or bring the target organization
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.480]   into any legal or open status
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.640]   that it can be more effectively suppressed.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.920]   They were very good at that.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.360]   So good that by the early 20th century
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   in the years preceding the Russian Revolution in 1917,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.920]   they had effectively infiltrated every radical party,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, SRs, great and small,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.960]   and placed people in positions of influence and leadership.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.600]   To the point that arguably, that is you can debate this,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   but I think in the whole,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.280]   they could largely dictate what those parties did.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.240]   Nothing was discussed at any central committee meeting
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.960]   of any revolutionary group
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.440]   that the Okrana wasn't immediately aware of.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.160]   And they often had people in positions
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   to influence what those decisions were.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.320]   Of course, that raises an interesting question
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.560]   is that if they were that good
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.880]   and they had infiltrated and effectively controlled
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.960]   most of the opposition,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   then how did the regime get overthrown by revolutionaries?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.480]   The answer to that is that it wasn't overthrown
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.400]   by revolutionaries.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.040]   It was overthrown by politicians.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.600]   That would then take us into a detour into Russian history,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.800]   but I'll just leave it with this.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.000]   If you look at 1917 and you look closely,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.840]   this is one of the things I would always tell my students
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   is that there are two Russian revolutions in 1917.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   There's the first one in March or February,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.600]   depending on your calendar,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.160]   that overthrows Nicholas II.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   Revolutionaries are really not involved with that.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.600]   Bolsheviks are nowhere to be seen.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.680]   Trotsky and Lenin are nowhere to be seen.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.600]   They have nothing to do with that.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.160]   That has to do effectively with a political conspiracy
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.000]   within the Russian parliament, the Duma,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.480]   to unseat an emperor they thought was bungling the war
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.240]   and was essentially a loser to begin with.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   And it was a coup d'etat, a parliamentary coup d'etat.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.000]   The temporary or provisional government
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.480]   that that revolution put in power
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.680]   was the one overthrown by Lenin eight months later.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.200]   And that government was essentially one dominated
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.760]   by moderate socialists.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.040]   It was a government that very quickly
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.520]   sort of turned to the left.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.040]   The guy we associate with that is Alexander Kerensky.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   Alexander Kerensky was a Russian socialist, a politician.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.200]   He was the quasi dictator of that regime.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.560]   He's the person, not the czar, who's overthrown by Lenin.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   So the revolutionaries,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.440]   they did not prove to be the fatal threat
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.680]   to the czarist regime.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.840]   It was the czarist political system itself that did that.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.440]   What then transpired was that the Okrana and its method
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.600]   and many of its agents then immediately segued over
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.920]   into the new Soviet security service.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.760]   So one of the first things that Lenin did
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.240]   in December of 1917, within a month of seizing power,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.120]   since the hold on power was tenuous at best,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.600]   was that, well, you're gonna need some kind of organization
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.680]   to infiltrate and suppress those pesky
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.000]   counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.440]   and all of the other enemies that we have.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000]   And so the extraordinary commission
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   to combat counter-revolution and sabotage,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   the Cheka, was formed.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   You put a veteran Bolshevik, Felix Dzerzhinsky,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   at the head of that,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.520]   someone you could politically rely upon,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.200]   but Dzerzhinsky built his organization
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.760]   essentially out of the Okrana.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.080]   I mean, there were all of these informers
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.000]   sitting around with nothing to do,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.960]   and they were employed.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.640]   In the early '20s, the kind of rank and file of the Cheka
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   might've been 80 to 90% former imperial officials.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.080]   Those were gradually decreased over time.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.240]   So why would they do that?
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.080]   Well, they were professionals.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.480]   They also needed to eat,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   and things were somewhat precarious.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   So if your job is to be an agent provocateur,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.600]   if your job is to infiltrate targeted organizations
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.280]   and lead them astray,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.960]   you do that for whoever pays you.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.040]   That's part of the professionalism which goes in.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.640]   And under the Soviets,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.880]   the Soviet intelligence services
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.160]   are also very good at that.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   They are very good at infiltrating people
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.680]   into opposing organizations.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.720]   And I guess the one example I would give
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.680]   to demonstrate that are the Cambridge Five,
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   the British traitors from Soviet standpoint heroes
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.100]   who were recruited, most notably Kim Philby,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.200]   Guy Burgess, Donald MacLean, Anthony Blunt,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.520]   and there may have been well more than five,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.220]   but that wasn't bad out of just Cambridge.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.880]   And then placing those people in high positions,
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.680]   the ultimate goal, of course,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.400]   is to get your people into positions of leadership
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.040]   and influence in the opposing intelligence service.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   And so they did.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.320]   Of course, it all fell apart,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.520]   and they ended up in, you know,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.560]   Philby ended up living the last part of his life
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.840]   in exile in Moscow,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.400]   but they got their money's worth out of him.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.240]   And you can also find this in KGB infiltration,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.280]   the CIA, the FBI, the Aldrich Ames,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.480]   the Hansen cases.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   Of course, we were infiltrating by we.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.820]   I mean, the Americans in the West
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.400]   managed to infiltrate our moles as well.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.480]   But if it came down, you know,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.720]   someone could dispute this,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.220]   but I would think if you were gonna come down
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.220]   to a kind of like a who had the most moles Super Bowl,
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.720]   probably the Soviets would come somewhat ahead of that.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.160]   - So the scale of the infiltration,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.680]   the number of people and the skill of it,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.400]   is there a case to be made that the Okhrana
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.920]   and the Chaka orchestrated both the components
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.460]   of the Russian Revolution as you described them?
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.440]   - Well, there's an interesting question for me.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.640]   I mean, there are all kinds of questions about this.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.140]   I mean, one of the questions is whether or not
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.520]   Lenin was an Okhrana agent.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.320]   Okay, I've just said heresy.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.560]   Some people will,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.480]   I'll do that quite often because I am a heretic
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.900]   and proud of it.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.740]   - Great.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.560]   - Why would you possibly say
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.480]   that Lenin could have been an Okhrana agent?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.440]   Well, let's look what he managed to do.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.120]   So you had, coming into the 20th century,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:51.440]   nominally a single Marxist movement,
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.200]   And Bolsheviks and Mensheviks,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.880]   Majorityites and Minorityites,
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.480]   are merely factions of that party.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.080]   And they always agreed that they were all Marxists
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.020]   and we all believe in dialectical materialism
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.920]   and the rise of, we're all socialists, comrade.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.820]   The difference was the tactical means
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.060]   by which one would attain this.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.340]   And what Lenin wanted was a militant,
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.520]   small-scale vanguard party.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.520]   He wanted a revolution, he wanted to seize power,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.000]   seize control of the state.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.200]   And once you have the state,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   then you induce socialism from above.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.600]   Whereas the majority of the people,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.800]   the so-called Mensheviks, the Minorityites,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.000]   who are, oddly enough, the vast majority of the party,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.240]   that's one of the first things,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.000]   how do you lose that argument?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.340]   Okay, how does the minority
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.780]   get to grab the name Majorityites?
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.120]   But Lenin did that.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.340]   So what Lenin wanted was a conspiratorial party
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.860]   of committed revolutionaries
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.860]   that would plot and scheme and undermine
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.900]   and eventually seize control of the state
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.940]   and induce socialism from above.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.900]   There were other Russian Marxists
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.260]   who thought that that sounded vaguely totalitarian
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.180]   and not really democratic and not even terribly socialist.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.520]   And they opposed that, ineffectively, from the beginning,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   outmaneuvered every step of the way.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.640]   The Mensheviks are a case study
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.280]   in failure of a political organization.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.020]   That, too, will be harassing to some people,
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.660]   but look, they lost.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.880]   Now, so what Lenin managed to do,
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.040]   starting around 1903, continuing on to this,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.860]   is he managed to divide,
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.080]   to take what had been a single Marxist party
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   and split it into angry, contending factions.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.180]   Because he and his Bolsheviks were on one side,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.560]   advocating a much more militant, conspiratorial policy.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.300]   The discombobulated Mensheviks were over on the other,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.660]   and in between were a lot of people
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.820]   who really didn't know where they stood on this.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.260]   I mean, sometimes they kind of agreed,
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.180]   he seems to be making sense today.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.700]   No, no, I don't think he's making sense in that day.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.380]   But he managed to completely disunify this organization.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.940]   Now, who could possibly have seen benefit in that?
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.980]   Del Grana.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.020]   Now, whether or not they put him up to it,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.340]   whether or not, in some way,
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.540]   they helped move him into a position of leadership
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.660]   or encouraged it or encouraged it through people around him,
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.260]   whether he was a witting or unwitting agent
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.180]   of the Tsarist secret police,
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.860]   he certainly accomplished exactly
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.300]   what it was that they had wanted.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.020]   And I find that suspicious.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.860]   It's one of those things that it's so convenient in a way
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.860]   is that I'm not necessarily sure that was an accident.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.140]   There's also this whole question to me
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.000]   as to what was going on within the Okrana itself.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.700]   Now, this is one of these questions
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.380]   we may come to later about how intelligence agencies
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.260]   interact or serve the governments
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.100]   to which they are theoretically subordinate.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.660]   They do tend to acquire a great deal of influence and power.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.260]   After all, their main job is to collect information.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.100]   And that information could be about all kinds of things.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.900]   Including people within the government structure itself.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.860]   And they also know how to leverage that information
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.620]   in a way to get people to do what you want them to do.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.020]   So an argument can be made, again, an argument,
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.380]   not a fact, merely an opinion,
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.280]   which is mostly what history is made out of, opinions,
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.780]   is that at some point between about 1900 and 1917,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.540]   people within the Okrana were playing their own game.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.100]   And that game took them in a direction
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.940]   which meant that continued loyalty to the emperor,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.820]   specifically to Nicholas II was no longer part of that.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.300]   To me, in a way, it seems almost during the events of 1917
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.340]   that one, you had an organization
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.700]   that was very effective when it did,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.660]   that suddenly just becomes ineffective.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.740]   Doesn't really disappear, these things don't go away,
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.860]   because it will reappear as the Okrana,
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.720]   basically fairly quickly.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.620]   But it raises the question to me as to what degree
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.300]   there were people within the organization
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.300]   who allowed events to take the course they wished.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:00.380]   - I always wonder how much deliberate planning there is
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.940]   within an organization like Okrana,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.820]   or if there's kind of a distributed intelligence
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.060]   that happens.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.060]   - Well, one of the key elements
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.740]   in any kind of intelligence organization or operation
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.140]   is compartmentalization, need to know.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.900]   So rarely do you have an occasion where everybody,
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.660]   everybody in an executive position
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.580]   are all brought into a big corporate meeting
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.820]   and we discuss all of the secret operations
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.660]   that are going on.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.480]   No, no, you never do that.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.700]   Only a very limited number of people should know about that.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.860]   If you have a person who is a case officer
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.700]   who's controlling agents,
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.100]   he's the only one that should know who those people are,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.820]   possibly his immediate superiors,
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.700]   but in no way do you want that to be common knowledge.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.860]   So information within the organization itself
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.260]   is compartmentalized.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.420]   So you don't need everybody to be in on it.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.260]   You don't even need necessarily the people
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.520]   who are nominally at the top.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.340]   For instance, the Okrana, the real boss of the Okrana
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.000]   was the Imperial Ministry of the Interior,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.620]   the Minister of the Interior, in fact,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.100]   but the Minister of the Interior
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.380]   had no real effective control over this at all.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.260]   I mean, to the point was that at one point early on,
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.040]   they actually organized the assassination of their own boss.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.020]   They have their agents among the revolutionaries
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.780]   kill the Minister of the Interior
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.940]   because he'll just be replaced by another one.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.820]   He's an Imperial bureaucrat.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.540]   He's not really part of their organization.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.420]   It's like a director of an intelligence agency
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.620]   appointed by the president.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.260]   Maybe he's part of the organization.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.340]   Maybe he isn't.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.660]   Maybe he is not one of us.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:51.180]   So you've got different levels,
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.060]   different compartments within it,
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.220]   and who's actually running the show?
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.940]   If anyone is, I don't know.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.420]   That's never supposed to be apparent.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.180]   - Well, that's a fascinating question.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.060]   I mean, you could see this with NKVD.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.020]   It's obviously an extremely powerful organization
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:13.080]   that starts to eat itself,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.100]   where everybody's pointing fingers internally also
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.700]   as a way to gain more power.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.380]   So the question is, in organizations like that
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.760]   that are so compartmentalized, where's the power?
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.220]   Where's the center of power?
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.460]   Because you would think, given that much power,
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.300]   some individual or a group of individuals
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   will start accumulating that power.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.820]   But it seems like that's not always a trivial thing
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.540]   because if you get too powerful,
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.460]   the snake eats that person.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.520]   - Well, if we go back into the founder
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.740]   of Soviet secret police, Felix Dzerzhinsky.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.420]   Dzerzhinsky dies in 1926, keels over,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.760]   after giving a heated speech to a party meeting.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.620]   Now, the common view, what you usually read,
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.020]   which was key for the time, is that, you know,
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.580]   clearly Stalin had him whacked
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.700]   because anytime someone died, it was almost always it.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.800]   And I think a lot of times he did.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.980]   But in some cases, Stalin's probably getting blamed
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.260]   for things that he didn't actually do.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.100]   Dzerzhinsky wasn't even opposed to Stalin.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.500]   So it's not clear why he would,
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.620]   but this was the, you know, Stalin died.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.100]   You know, obviously he was poisoned.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.340]   Something happened.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.900]   It was an unnatural death.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.260]   Somebody goes in for an operation.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.460]   You know, it gets a little too much anesthesia.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.660]   Stalin killed them.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.060]   Somebody tips over in a canoe in upstate New York.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.220]   Stalin killed them.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.740]   There's actually a case about that.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.340]   So that itself can be kind of useful
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.180]   where every time someone dies, they think you killed them.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.340]   That's kind of an interesting method
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.280]   of intimidation in that regard.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.420]   But the suspicion is nonetheless there.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   Dzerzhinsky had been, he was the grand inquisitor.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.780]   He was seemingly firmly in control of the organization.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.860]   Of course, maybe he wasn't.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.260]   Maybe he was.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.660]   My guess would be is that if Dzerzhinsky's death
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.660]   was not natural causes, that he was probably eliminated
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.680]   by someone within his own organization.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.840]   And then you look at the people who take over.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.300]   His immediate successor is Vyacheslav Menzhinsky,
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.260]   who's really not really a secret policeman,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.660]   more a kind of intellectual dilettante.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.020]   But if you look behind him,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.620]   you'll notice the fellow is Henrikh Yagoda.
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.180]   And Yagoda will really sort of manage things
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.180]   from behind the scenes until Menzhinsky dies in 1934.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.740]   And then Yagoda will hold on
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.340]   until he's the victim of the purges,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.400]   I think, in '37 or '38.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.820]   Yagoda is ambitious, murderous.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.620]   And if I was going to point the finger
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.780]   to anybody who possibly had Dzerzhinsky whacked,
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.380]   it would be him.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.480]   And for the purposes simply of advancement.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.720]   - That's the, you know, the person to look out
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.360]   at any kind of corporate organization
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.080]   is your immediate subordinate,
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.280]   the person who could move into your job,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.560]   because more than likely,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.880]   that's exactly what they're planning to do.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.540]   - Yeah, just one step away from the very top.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.280]   Somebody there will probably accumulate the most power.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.720]   You mentioned that the various Russian intelligence agencies
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.640]   were good at creating agent provocateurs,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.960]   infiltrating the halls of power.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.520]   What does it take to do that?
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.240]   - Well, there's a interesting little acronym called MICE,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.760]   M-I-C-E, and it's generally used.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.880]   And it's just the way in which you would acquire,
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.200]   how do you get people to work for you?
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   Well, M stands for money.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.160]   You pay them.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.360]   People are greedy.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.680]   They want money.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.000]   You know, if you look at Aldrich Ames,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.400]   he had a very, very expensive wife with expensive tastes.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.360]   So he wanted money.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.200]   I is for ideology.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.880]   So during, particularly in the 1920s and the 1930s,
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   the Soviets were very effective in exploiting communists,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.400]   you know, people who wanted to serve the great cause.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.720]   Even though that's initially not really
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.240]   what they wanted to do,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.000]   because the idea was that if you recruit agents
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.720]   from among, let's say, American communists,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.440]   you compromise the party.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.400]   Because exactly what your enemies are going to say
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.160]   is that all communists are Soviet spies.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.480]   They're all traitors in some way.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.240]   So you would really wanna keep those two things separate,
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.880]   but ideology was just so convenient.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.160]   And those people would just work for you so well.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.040]   They were, you could get them to do anything,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.240]   betray their grandmother.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.640]   They would go ahead and do that for the greater good.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.840]   So ideology can be a motivation.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   And that can be someone who is a devoted Marxist-Leninist.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.760]   It can also be someone who's a disgruntled communist,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.300]   because there's no anti-communist like an ex-communist.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:30.760]   Those who lose the faith can become very, very useful.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.000]   For instance, if you look in the case
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.320]   of American intelligence,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.280]   the people who essentially temporarily destroyed
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.320]   much of the KGB organization in the US post-World War II
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.280]   were people like Whitaker Chambers,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.880]   Louis Budenz, Elizabeth Bentley.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.240]   All of those people had been communist party members.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   They had all been part of the Red Faithful.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.320]   They all, for one reason or another, became disillusioned
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.640]   and turned rat or patriot,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   whichever case you may want to put in that regard.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.320]   - What does the C and the E stand for?
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.720]   - The C is for coercion.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   That's where you have to persuade someone to work for you.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.520]   You have to pressure them.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.100]   So usually you blackmail them.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.820]   You know, that could be they have a gambling habit.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.960]   You know, in the old days,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.880]   it was very often because they were gay, okay?
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.600]   Gets them in a position where they can be compromised
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.920]   and you can get them to do your bidding.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.800]   But those people usually have a certain amount of control.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.640]   Here's an interesting example
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.720]   of how the Okrana tended to handle this.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.440]   I think it's still largely used.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.040]   You'd round up a bunch of revolutionaries
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.120]   on some charge or another,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.000]   distributing revolutionary literature,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.880]   running an illegal printing press.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.240]   You bring a guy into the room and you say,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.720]   "Okay, you're gonna work for us."
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.560]   He, of course, would refuse to do so.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.000]   And they go, "Well, if you refuse,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.920]   "we'll keep the rest of your comrades in jail for a while.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.060]   "You know, maybe beat them with a rubber truncheon or so.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.640]   "And then we're just gonna let you go.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.600]   "We're just gonna put you back out on the street.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.020]   "And if you don't work for us,
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.420]   "we will spread the rumor through our agents
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.440]   "already in your organization that you are.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.760]   "And then what will your comrades do?
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   "How long are you going to live?"
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.440]   So you see, you have no choice.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.320]   You're ours, and you're going to cooperate with us.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.400]   And the way that that effectiveness would be ensured
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.760]   is that you have multiple agents
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.440]   within the same organization
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.560]   who don't know who each other are.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.200]   That's very important.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.360]   And they'll all be filing reports.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.920]   So let's say you have three agents
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.520]   inside the central committee of the SR party,
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.920]   and there's a committee meeting,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.640]   and you're going to look at the reports they file.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   They all better agree with each other, right?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.000]   If one person doesn't report what the other two do,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.560]   then perhaps they're not entirely doing their job,
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.960]   and they can be liquidated at any time.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.800]   All you do is drop the dime on them.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.900]   And this was done periodically.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.480]   In fact, in some cases, you would betray your own agents
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.960]   just to completely discombobulate to the organization.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.240]   This happened in one particular case around 1908.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.080]   The fellow who was the head
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.440]   of the chief revolutionary terrorist organization,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.480]   which wasn't Bolshevik,
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.560]   but the so-called socialist revolutionaries,
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.280]   they're actually the biggest revolutionary party,
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.200]   the SRs, who aren't even actually Marxists, more anarchists.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.000]   But they went all in for the propaganda of the deed.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.520]   They really like blowing people up and carry out a,
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.960]   and it carried out quite a campaign of terrorism.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.040]   The fellow who was the head
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.600]   of that terrorist organization
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.640]   was a fellow by the name of Yevno Azef.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   And Yevno Azef was, guess what, an Okhrana agent.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.920]   Everything he did, every assassination that he planned,
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.880]   he did in consultation with his control.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.800]   So he'd kind of run out his string.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.600]   There was increasing suspicion of him.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   He was also asking for a lot more money.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.520]   So the Okhrana itself arranged to have him ride it out.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.600]   And what did that do?
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.080]   Well, what do you do in your party
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.000]   when you find out the chief of your terrorist brigade
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.120]   was a secret police agent?
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.040]   It's consternation and mistrust.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.680]   Nobody in the party would ever trust
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.240]   and you couldn't tell who you were sitting around.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.800]   I know that a fellow I wrote a biography on,
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.960]   Boris Savinkov, who was a Russian revolutionary,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   and the second in command
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.760]   within the terrorist organization.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.040]   By the way, the guy that wanted Azef's job
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.400]   so bad he could taste it.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.040]   Well, on the one level, he expressed absolute horror
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.520]   that his boss was a police agent.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.360]   And well, he should,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.600]   because Savinkov was a police agent too.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.280]   See, they already had the number two
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.480]   waiting in the wings to take over.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.040]   But he was legitimately shocked.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.760]   He didn't really suspect that.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.080]   So it's a way of manipulating this.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.600]   And then finally we come to the E.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.200]   That, I think, is the most important, ego.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.720]   Sometimes people spy or betray
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.400]   because of the egotistical satisfaction that they receive.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.760]   The sheer kind of Machiavellian joy in deceit.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.680]   An example of that would be Kim Philby,
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.880]   one of the Cambridge Five.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.320]   Now, Philby was a communist,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.720]   and he would argue that he always saw himself
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   as serving the communist cause.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.640]   But he also made this statement,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.920]   I think it's in the preface to his autobiography,
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.680]   and he says, "One never looks twice
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.480]   "at the offer of service in the elite force."
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.240]   And he's talking about his recruitment
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.600]   by the NKVD in the 1930s.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.680]   And he was absolutely chuffed by that.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.800]   The mere fact that they would want him,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.480]   what he considered to be a first-rate organization
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.520]   would want him, satisfied his ego.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.800]   And if I was to take a guess
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.640]   as to whether it was ideological motivation,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.000]   whether it was the romance of communism,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.680]   or whether it was the appeal of ego
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.280]   that was the most important in his career of treason,
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.320]   I'd go with ego.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.360]   And I think that figures into a lot.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.320]   People don't, someone doesn't get the promotions
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.000]   that they wanted.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.040]   Again, if you look at something
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.520]   like Aldrich Ame's career in particular,
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.240]   you've got these kind of,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.960]   his career in the CIA was hit or miss.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.240]   He didn't get the postings or promotions
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.920]   that he wanted as a valuation.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.360]   He never felt that he got credit for doing that.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.200]   And that's the type of thing
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.120]   that tends to stick in someone's craw.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.440]   And can lead, for egotistical reasons,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.000]   an added incentive to betray.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.800]   - Yeah, that there's a boost to the ego
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.320]   when you can deceive,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.960]   sort of not play by the rules of the world,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   and just play with powerful people
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.800]   like they're your pawns.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.400]   - You're the only one that knows this.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.640]   You're the only one that knows
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.680]   that the person who is sitting across from you,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.880]   to which you have sworn your loyalty,
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.200]   you are simultaneously betraying.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.680]   What a rush that must be for some people.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.800]   - I wonder how many people are susceptible to this.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.680]   I would like to believe that the people have,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.480]   a lot of people haven't the integrity
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.200]   to at least withstand the MI,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.360]   the money and the ideology,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.080]   the pull of that, and the ego.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   - It can also be a combination of the two.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.360]   I mean, you can create a recipe of these things.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   Certain amount of money, ego,
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.800]   and a little push of coercion,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   that if you don't, we'll rat you out.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.280]   You'll be exposed.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.120]   - What are some differences to you
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.040]   as we look at the history of the 20th century
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   between the Russian intelligence
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.840]   and the American intelligence, the CIA?
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.440]   - If you look at both the Okhrana and the KGB,
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.280]   one of the things that you find consistent
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.120]   is that they, a single organization
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.160]   handled foreign intelligence,
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.560]   that is spying upon enemy or hostile governments,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.720]   and also internal security.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.240]   So that's all part of it.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.080]   Whereas if you look at the U.S. models that evolves,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.880]   you eventually have the FBI under Hoover
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.520]   who insists that he's going to be
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.080]   the counterintelligence force.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.880]   Okay, if they're commie spies running around America,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.040]   it's the FBI who's supposed to ferret them out.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.560]   The CIA is not supposed to be involved in that.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   And the charter, the basic agreement in 1947,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.960]   did not give the CIA any,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.920]   it's often said they were barred from spying on Americans,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.920]   which isn't quite true.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.640]   You can always find a way to do that.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.880]   What they don't have is they don't have
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.800]   any police or judicial powers.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.320]   They can't run around in the country
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.640]   carrying guns to use on people.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.840]   They can't arrest you.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.240]   They can't interrogate you.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.280]   They can't jail you.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.240]   They have no police or judicial powers.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.360]   Now, that means they have to get that from someone else.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.120]   That doesn't mean that other agencies can't be brought in
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.200]   or local police officials,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.160]   corn or whatever you need,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.200]   you can eventually acquire.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.360]   But they can't do that directly.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.240]   So you've got this division between foreign intelligence
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.600]   and domestic counterintelligence,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   often split between hostile organizations.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.480]   The relationship between the FBI and the CIA,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.080]   I think it's fair to say is not chummy, never has been.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.320]   There's always been a certain amount of rivalry
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.600]   and contention between the two.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.040]   And it's not to say that something like that
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.720]   didn't exist between the domestic counterintelligence
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   and foreign intelligence components of the KGB,
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.880]   but there would be less of that to a degree
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.120]   because there was a single organization.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.440]   They're all answerable to the same people.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.880]   So that gives you a certain greater amount,
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.440]   I think, of leeway and power
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.040]   because you're controlling both of those ends.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.400]   I remember somebody telling me once that,
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.480]   and he was a retired KGB officer.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.000]   There you go, retired.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.760]   One of the things that he found amusing
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.560]   was that in his role,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.200]   one of the things that he could be
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   is that he could be anywhere at any time in any dress,
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.960]   which meant that he could be in or out of uniform
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.800]   and any place at any time.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   He was authorized to do that.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.040]   - So more freedom, more power.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.240]   - I think one of the things that you would often view
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.160]   is that the Russians are simply naturally meaner.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.600]   There's less respect for human rights.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.960]   There's a greater tendency to abuse power
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.640]   that one might have.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   I mean, frankly, they're all pretty good at that.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.760]   They're probably, it is fair to say
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.320]   that there's probably some degree of cultural differences,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.920]   that it not necessarily for institutional reasons,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.320]   but cultural reasons.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.920]   There could well be things that Americans
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.720]   might balk at doing more than you would find
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.640]   on the Russian or Soviet side of the equations.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.960]   The other aspect of that is that Russian history
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   is long and contentious and bloody.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.080]   One of the things it certainly teaches
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.640]   is you never trust foreigners.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.480]   Every foreign government, anywhere,
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.920]   any country on your border is a real or potential enemy.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.640]   They will all at some point, if given the chance, invade you.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   Therefore, they must always be treated with great suspicion.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.400]   That goes back to something that I think
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.280]   the British observed was that countries don't have friends.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.320]   They have interests,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.400]   and those interests can change over time.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.720]   - Well, the CIA is probably equally suspicious
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.120]   of all other nations.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.040]   - That's your job.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.400]   You're supposed to be suspicious.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.440]   Your job is not to be trusting.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.680]   Yeah, the basic job of an intelligence agency
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.640]   is to safeguard your secrets and steal the other guys,
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.320]   and then hide those away.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.280]   - Are there laws, either intelligence agencies,
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.240]   that they're not willing to break?
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.760]   Is it basically lawless operation
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.320]   to where you can break any law
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.760]   as long as it accomplishes the task?
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.040]   - Well, I think John le Carre gave his pen name.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.640]   He was talking about his early recruitment
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   into British intelligence,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.440]   and one of the things he remember being told up front
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   was that if you do this, you have to be willing to lie,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.200]   and you have to be willing to kill.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.880]   Now, those are things that,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.160]   in ordinary human interactions, are bad things.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.360]   Generally, we don't like it when people lie to us.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   We expect that people will act honestly towards us,
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.560]   whether that's being a businessman you're involved with,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.040]   your employers.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.600]   We're often disappointed in that
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.000]   because people do lie all the time for a variety of reasons,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.280]   but honesty is generally considered to be a bit,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.760]   but in a realm where deception is a rule,
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.440]   dishonesty is a virtue, to be good at that.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.760]   To be able to lie convincingly
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.840]   is good.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.560]   It's one of the things you need to do,
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.440]   and killing also is generally frowned upon.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.560]   You know, put people in prison for that.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.680]   They're otherwise executed, but in certain circumstances,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.720]   killing is one of those things
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.880]   that you need to be able to do.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.800]   So what he felt he was being told in that case
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.600]   is that, you know, once you enter this realm,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.040]   the same sort of moral rules
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.600]   that apply in general British society do not apply,
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.160]   and if you're squeamish about it, you won't fit in.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.440]   You have to be able to do those things.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.840]   - I wonder how often those intelligence agencies
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.640]   in the 20th century, and of course,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   the natural question extending it to the 21st century,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.160]   how often they go to the assassination,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.040]   how often they go to the kill part of that
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.440]   versus just the espionage.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.920]   - Let's take an example from American intelligence,
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   from the CIA, 1950s, 1960s, into the 1970s, MKUltra.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.800]   That is a secret program which was involved
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.000]   with what is generally categorized as mind control,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.920]   which really means messing with people's heads.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.480]   And what was the goal of that?
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.400]   Well, there seemed to have been lots of goals,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.960]   but there was an FBI memo that was,
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.520]   I recently acquired, quite legally, by the way,
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   it's declassified, but it's from 1949.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.200]   So this is only two years after the CIA came into existence,
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.640]   and it's an FBI memo because the FBI, of course,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.680]   very curious what the CIA is up to,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.840]   and the FBI are not part of this meeting,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.040]   but they have someone in,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.920]   they're sort of spying on what's going on.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.120]   So there was a meeting which was held
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.380]   in a private apartment in New York.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.480]   So it's not held in any kind of,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.320]   it's essentially never really happened
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.640]   because it's in somebody's house.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.800]   But, and there are a couple of guys there from the CIA.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.100]   One of them is Cleve Baxter.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.800]   Cleve Baxter is the great godfather of the lie detector.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.240]   Pretty much everything that we know
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.940]   or think we know about lie detectors today,
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.540]   they owe to Cleve Baxter.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.260]   He's also the same guy that thought that plants could feel,
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.940]   but, which somehow was a derivative
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.180]   of his work on lie detectors.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.380]   So these guys are there,
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.740]   and they're giving a talk to some military
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.500]   and other personnel, and there's certain parts
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.140]   of the document which were, of course, redacted,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.620]   but you could figure out what it is
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.860]   that they're talking about.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.580]   And they're talking about hypnotic suggestion,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.420]   and all the wonderful things that you can potentially do
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.960]   with hypnotic suggestion.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.000]   And two of the things they note is that one of the things
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.500]   we could potentially do is erase memories
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.980]   from people's minds and implant false memories.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.780]   That would be really keen to do that.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.580]   Just imagine how that would be done.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.100]   So here to me is the interesting point.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.340]   They're talking about this in 1949.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.020]   MKUltra does not come along until really 1953,
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.740]   although there are all sorts of, you know,
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.100]   Artichoke and others.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.660]   Everything is sort of leading up to that.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.220]   It's simply an elaboration of programs
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.420]   that were already there.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.140]   I don't think that it ultimately matters
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:56.140]   whether you can implant memories or erase memories.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.980]   To me, the important part is they thought they could,
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.780]   and they were going to try to do it.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.660]   And that eventually is what you find out
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:11.060]   in the efforts made during the 1950s and '60s
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.620]   through MKUltra, MKSurge, MKNaomi,
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.180]   and all the others that came out.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.420]   That's one of the things they're working for.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.840]   And among the few MKUltra era documents that survived,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.060]   there's that whole question, is that you get someone
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.060]   to put a gun to someone's head and pull the trigger,
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.500]   and then I remember it later.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.440]   Yeah, you could, interestingly enough.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.020]   So non-direct violence, controlling people's minds,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.480]   controlling people's minds at scale,
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.980]   and experimenting with different kinds of ways of doing that.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.180]   Well, one person put it that the basic argument there,
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.500]   or the basic thing you were after,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.820]   was to understand the architecture of the human mind,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.780]   how it worked, how it put together,
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.500]   and then how you could take those pieces apart
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.300]   and assemble them in different ways.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.600]   So this comes, this is where hypnosis comes in,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.780]   which is a, was, then, still is, fairly spooky thing.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.780]   Nobody's ever explained to me exactly what it is.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.300]   The idea was that could you,
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.440]   you think of the whole possibilities in this case,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.060]   could you create an alternate personality
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:26.440]   and use that alternate personality in an agent role,
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.580]   but then be able to turn it on and off,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   so subsequently the person,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.420]   which that personality inhabited,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:39.160]   was captured and interrogated, tortured,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.660]   had their fingernails torn out,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.000]   they would have no memory of it.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.680]   They couldn't give any kind of secret away
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.480]   because it was embedded in some part of their brain
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.160]   where there was a completely different person.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.080]   I mean, you can just imagine the possibilities
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.920]   that you can dream up.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.880]   And again, it's not, I think,
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   the question is to whether that is possible
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.140]   or whether it was done.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.760]   Well, I suspect that both of those are true,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.920]   but that you would try to do it.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.960]   Then imagine the mischief that comes out of that.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.680]   And one of the big complaints from a legal standpoint
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.160]   about MK, Ultra, and the rest
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.600]   is that you were having medical experiments,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.900]   essentially, being carried out on people
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.040]   without their knowledge and against their will,
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.880]   which is, you know, a no-no.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.480]   Yeah, the fact that you're willing to do medical experiments
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.840]   says something about what you're willing to do.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.980]   And I'm sure that same spirit, innovative spirit,
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   persists to this day.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:46.000]   And maybe less so, I hope, less so in the United States,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.880]   but probably in other intelligence agencies in the world.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.800]   - Well, one thing that was learned,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.920]   and the reason why most MK, Ultra,
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.760]   and similar records were destroyed
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.080]   on order in the early '70s,
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.360]   around the time the CIA became
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.080]   under a certain amount of scrutiny.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.480]   Now, the mid '70s were not a good time for the agency
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.840]   because you had the church committee
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.360]   breathing down their neck.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.080]   You had all of these assassins, you know.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.800]   People were asking lots of questions.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.440]   And so you need to dump this stuff
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.640]   because there's all kinds of,
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.080]   because you were committing crimes against American citizens.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.240]   So let's eradicate it.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.920]   And the important lesson to be learned
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.880]   is that never do this type of thing again,
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.560]   where at least in any way
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.400]   in which the agency's direct fingerprints are placed on it.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.920]   You can pay people.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.080]   You can subsidize research.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.000]   You can set up venture capital firms.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.800]   You got plenty of money.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.460]   And you can funnel that money into the hands of people
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.760]   who will carry out this research privately.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.880]   So if something goes wrong, you have perfect deniability.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.640]   - On the topic of mice,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   on the topic of money, ideology, coercion, and ego,
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.880]   let me ask you about a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.200]   So there is a conspiracy theory
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.320]   that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.520]   at a high level, if we can just talk about that.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.680]   Is that something that's at all even possible?
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.280]   That you have, basically, this would be for coercion.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.920]   You get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.680]   and then you collect evidence on them
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.840]   so that you can then have leverage on them.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.080]   - Well, let's look at what Epstein was doing.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.000]   He was a, well, he was a businessman
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.400]   who then also developed a very lucrative sideline
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.580]   in being a high-level procurer,
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.840]   basically in supplying young girls.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   And he also filmed much of that activity.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:45:01.860]   I think his partner in this, Ghislaine,
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.680]   and I'm hoping I'm pronouncing her name correctly.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   - I think it's Ghislaine.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   - Ghislaine, well, I've heard it both ways,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.880]   Ghislaine or Ghislaine, whichever it may be.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.480]   I think her argument at one point was that,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.560]   well, we did this to protect ourselves,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.720]   but this type of thing has been done before.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.400]   There's nothing new about this,
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   getting influential people in compromising situations
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.820]   and filming them.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.840]   I could give you another historical example of that.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   In late 1920, actually early 1930s, just pre-Nazi Berlin,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.480]   there was a very prominent sort of would-be psychic
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.520]   and occultist by the name of Erich Jan Hannesen.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.400]   He had a private yacht, I think it was called the Seven Sins,
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.640]   and he hosted parties.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.560]   He also had a whole club called the Palace of the Occult,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.200]   which hosted parties where things went on,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.960]   and there were cameras everywhere.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.600]   He filmed important people.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.800]   Guys like the brown shirt chief of Berlin
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:07.040]   in various states of undress and sexual Congress.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.940]   And he did that for the purposes of blackmail.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   So in Epstein's case, he is a procurer of young girls
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:22.480]   to wealthy men, largely,
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.800]   and many of those events were recorded.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.280]   Now, even if it wasn't his intention
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.560]   to use them for blackmail,
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   think of what someone else could do
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.620]   because people know about this.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   So you can raise a question, is this not,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.200]   Epstein is just kind of a greedy pervert,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.800]   but through his greedy perversion,
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.480]   he's now collecting information that could be useful.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.280]   Who could that be useful to?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.820]   Who would like dirt on Prince Andrew?
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.760]   Think of all the people who were there,
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.280]   and there were important people
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.560]   who went to Lolita Island.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.640]   So if it isn't Epstein directly,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.880]   he might have been being,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.880]   I'm not trying to let him off the hook
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.600]   because I have anything for him.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.040]   He was either running his own blackmail business
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.800]   or someone was using him as a front for that.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.520]   I mean, I think we're kidding ourselves
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.400]   if we try to pretend that's not what was going on.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.400]   - So you think even American intelligence agencies
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.600]   would be willing to swoop in
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.720]   and take advantage of a situation like that?
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.040]   - Well, you know.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.860]   - Just in case.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.760]   - American politicians could ultimately
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.820]   end up in a position to oversee things
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.400]   like intelligence budgets.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.320]   One of them might even become director.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.140]   You never know.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.840]   You can never tell what some crazy president might do.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.380]   It could be very,
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.480]   one of the guys who understood the part was J. Edgar Hoover.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.880]   J. Edgar Hoover spent a long time
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.080]   collecting dossiers and politicians.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.200]   How do you think he'd remain director of the FBI
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.320]   as long as he did?
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   Because he systematically collected dirt on people.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:15.840]   So there is a history of this type of thing.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.080]   And again, you could argue that's partly for his protection
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.160]   to keep his job,
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   to protect the sanctity and security of the bureau.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.520]   You can find a million different ways to justify that.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.520]   - It's really dark.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.920]   - Well, there is that side to human nature.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.240]   Let's put it that way.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.320]   - Whether it's the CIA or the Krona,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.600]   maybe that's what the president of the United States
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.320]   sees when they show up to office
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.520]   is all the stuff they have on him or her.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:53.360]   And say that there's a internal mechanism of power
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.960]   that you don't wanna mess with.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.680]   And so you will listen.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.480]   Whether that internal mechanism of power
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.560]   is the military industrial complex or whatever,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.840]   the bureaucracy of government.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.280]   - Kind of actually the deep state.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.120]   - The deep state.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.680]   - The entrenched bureaucratic.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.640]   Well, it's been said, and I think it's generally true,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.040]   that bureaucratic creatures are like any other creatures.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.640]   It basically exists to perpetuate itself and to grow.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.480]   I mean, nobody wants to go out of business.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.920]   And of course, then you get all of these things
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.840]   like Pizzagate and accusations of one form or another.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.080]   But here's an interesting thing to consider.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.120]   Okay, and I want to argue that I'm not saying
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.800]   that Pizzagate in any way was real or QAnon had anything,
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.040]   but where do they get these ideas from?
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.880]   So let's ask ourselves, do pedophiles exist?
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:49.560]   Do organized pedophile organizations exist?
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.520]   Yeah, they share information, pictures,
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.700]   they're out there on the dark web.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.820]   They cooperate.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.700]   So does child trafficking exist?
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.480]   Yeah, it does.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:11.640]   So in other words, whether or not specific conspiracy
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.960]   theories about this or that group
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.800]   of organized pedophile cultists is real,
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.160]   all the ingredients for that to be real are there.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.040]   Pedophiles exist, organized pedophilia exists,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.220]   child and human trafficking exists.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:34.400]   At some point, at some time,
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.560]   someone will put all of those together.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.700]   In fact, certainly, they already have.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.080]   - We'll jump around a little bit,
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.220]   but because your work is so fascinating
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.960]   and it covers so many topics.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   So let's, if we jump into the present
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.920]   with the Bohemian Grove and the Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.720]   - Bilderbergers.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.080]   - So the elites, as I think you've referred to them.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.920]   So this gathering of the elites.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.440]   Can you just talk about them?
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.960]   What is this?
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.120]   - Well, first thing I have to point out
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.040]   is that Bohemian Grove is a place, not an organization.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.960]   It's where the Bohemian Club meets.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.800]   It's that 2,700 acre old growth redwoods
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.440]   near north of San Francisco.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   The Bohemian Club began, I think we're back to the 1870s.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.020]   Its initial members were mostly journalists.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.680]   In fact, supposedly the name itself comes from,
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.880]   it was a term for an itinerant journalist
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.560]   who moved from paper to paper, it was called the Bohemian.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:47.520]   And although I think there may be other reasons
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.160]   why that particular term was chosen as well,
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.200]   but I think the original five members,
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.460]   there were like three journalists,
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.320]   there was a merchant and there was a vintner guy
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.680]   who owned a vineyard, it's California, how surprising.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.480]   None of them terribly wealthy,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.440]   but they formed an exclusive men's club.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.920]   Was and still is.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.000]   Nothing terribly unusual about that at the time.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.840]   But it became fashionable, and as it became fashionable,
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.520]   more wealthy people wanted to become part of it.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.600]   And the thing about getting rich guys to join your club
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   is what do rich guys have?
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.440]   Money.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.900]   And of course, it's one of those rich guys
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.000]   that bought "Bohemian Grove"
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.160]   where now you build your old boy's summer camp,
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.420]   which is what it is.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.760]   They got cabins with goofy names.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.600]   They go there, they perform skits,
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.440]   they dress up in costumes.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.500]   True, some of those skits look like pagan human sacrifices,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.720]   but it's just a skit.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.040]   What's really going on there?
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.560]   So on the one hand, you can argue,
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.040]   look, it's a rich guys club.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.920]   They like to get out there.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.220]   The whole motto of the place
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.840]   is weaving spiders come not here.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.160]   So we're never gonna talk about business.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.440]   We just wanna get out into the woods, put on some robes,
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.060]   burn a couple of effigies in front of the owl,
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.620]   have a good time, probably get drunk a lot.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.740]   - What's with the robes?
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:10.100]   Why do they do weird, creepy shit?
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.180]   Why do they put on a mask and the robe
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:17.180]   and do the plays and the owl and the sacrificing,
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.540]   I don't know, whatever.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.220]   - Why do you have a giant owl?
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.340]   I mean, why do you do that?
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.540]   - Well, what is that in human nature?
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.940]   'Cause I don't think rich people
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.900]   are different than not rich people.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.380]   What is it about wealth and power
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.700]   that brings that out of people?
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.560]   - Well, part of it is the ritual aspect of it.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.700]   And that clearly is a ritual.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.060]   Rituals are pretty simple.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.980]   Rituals are just a series of actions performed
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.880]   in a precise sequence to produce an effect.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.820]   That describes a lot of things.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.260]   It describes plays, symphonies,
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.100]   every movie you've ever seen.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.180]   A movie is a ritual.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.700]   It is a series of actions carried out
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.500]   in a precise sequence to produce an effect
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.260]   with an added soundtrack to cue you
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.900]   to what emotions you're supposed to be feeling.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.860]   - It's a great idea.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.820]   So the rich people should just go to a movie
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.380]   or maybe just go to a Taylor Swift concert.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.780]   Like, why do you have to put--
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.940]   - Well--
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.940]   - Why the owl thing?
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   - Part of it is to create this kind of sense,
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.300]   I suppose, of group solidarity.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.020]   You know, you're all going to appear.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:28.020]   Also, a way of sort of transcending yourself in a way.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.860]   You know, when you put on the robe,
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.340]   it's like putting on a uniform.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.300]   You are in some way a different or more important person.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.500]   It's a ritual.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.300]   Okay, the key ritual at Bohemian Grove
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.780]   is a thing called the cremation of care.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.340]   And cremation, and that's what it's supposed to be.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.460]   We're gonna put all of our, you know,
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.740]   we're rich, important people.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.700]   We have to make all of these critical decisions.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.220]   Life is so hard.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.900]   So we're gonna go out here in the woods
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.700]   and we're gonna kick back
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.580]   and we're all gonna gather around the lake
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.900]   and then we're gonna carry, you know,
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.740]   it's wicker, it's not a real person.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:07.140]   And how would you know?
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.100]   And then we're gonna, and we're gonna,
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.700]   and this is the cremation of our care.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.220]   But it's a ritual which is meant to produce
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.420]   a sense of solidarity and relief
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.460]   among those people who are there.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.380]   The question comes down with the rituals
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.460]   is how seriously do you take them?
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.300]   How important is this to the people who carry them out?
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.980]   And the interesting answer to that
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.700]   is that for some people it's, you know,
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.020]   for some people it's just boring.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.100]   I mean, there are probably people standing around the aisle
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.540]   who think this is ridiculous
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.260]   and can't wait for it to get over with.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.140]   There are other people who are kind of excited about it
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.940]   and get caught up into it.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.300]   But other people can take it very seriously.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.820]   It's all a matter of the intention that you have
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.620]   about what the ritual means.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.060]   And I don't mean to suggest by that
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.300]   that there's anything necessarily sinister
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.540]   about what's going on.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.060]   But it is clearly a ritual carried out
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.980]   for some kind of group reinforcing purpose.
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.980]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.540]   You don't have to do it that way.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.500]   That's not an, I mean, I've gone to summer camps
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.980]   and we never carried out mock sacrifices
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.540]   in front of an owl.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.220]   All right, you know, we did all those other things.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.660]   We didn't even have any robes either.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.660]   So it goes beyond merely a rich guy's summer camp,
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.860]   although that's an aspect of it.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.420]   But it also, I think, often obscures it.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:37.300]   Focusing on Bohemian Grove at the getaway of the club
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.020]   ignores that the club is around all the time.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.100]   That's what's at the center of this.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.060]   It is the club and its members.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.980]   So despite all the talk about,
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.300]   no, no weaving spiders coming around here,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.660]   one of the other features of the summer meeting
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.820]   are things called lakeside talks.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.780]   And this, often people are invited to go there.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.900]   And one of the people who was invited,
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.300]   I think around 1968, was Richard Nixon,
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.820]   who was making his political comeback.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.220]   And he was invited to give a talk
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.180]   where very important people are listening.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:15.380]   And Nixon, in his memoirs, realized what was going on.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.740]   He was being auditioned as to whether or not
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.660]   he was going to be right.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.180]   He recognized that that was really the beginning
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.180]   of his second presidential campaign.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.780]   He was being vetted.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:31.180]   So one of the main theories,
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.100]   call it a conspiracy theory or not,
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.460]   about the Bohemian Club and the gatherings
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.620]   is that people of wealth and influence gather together.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:44.300]   And whether or not it's part of the agenda or not,
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.620]   inevitably you're going to talk about things of interest.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.980]   But to me, the mere fact that you invite people in,
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.060]   political leaders, to give lakeside talks
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:55.380]   means that there are weaving spiders which are going on.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.620]   And it is a perfect private venue
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:04.180]   to vet people for political office.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.940]   I mean, yeah, where else are you going to do it
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.580]   if you're interested in vetting,
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.620]   if you're interested in powerful people selecting?
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.820]   - Well, see, here's the question.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.580]   Are these guys actually picking who's going to be president?
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.540]   Is that the decision which is being made?
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:21.140]   Or are they just deciding what horses they're going to back?
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.060]   - Right.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.340]   - I think the latter is the simpler version of it,
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.940]   but it doesn't mean it's the other way around.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.740]   But these are the kinds of, you know,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.180]   I mean, Nixon was, you know,
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.580]   there was the whole 1960 thing.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.180]   So he's the new Nixon, remember this?
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.660]   And this is where the new Nixon
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.580]   apparently made a good impression on the right people
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:46.380]   because he did indeed get the Republican nomination
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.820]   and he did indeed become president.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.140]   - Well, there could also be a much more
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:55.860]   innocent explanation of really it's powerful people
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.460]   getting together and having conversations
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.820]   and through that conversation,
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.380]   influencing each other's view of the world.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:05.940]   And just having a legitimate discussion of policies.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.620]   - But why wouldn't they?
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.460]   I mean, why would you assume
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.940]   that people are not going to do that?
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.740]   - It's the owl thing with the robes, like what?
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.260]   - Why the owl and why the robes?
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.260]   - Which is why it becomes really compelling
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.260]   when guys like Alex Jones,
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.060]   forgive me, but I've not watched his documentary,
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.340]   I probably should at some point,
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.300]   about the Bohemian Grove,
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:33.380]   where he claims that there's a Satanist human sacrifice
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.780]   of I think children.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:43.420]   And I think that's quite a popular conspiracy theory
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.140]   or it has lost popularity.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.060]   It kind of like transformed itself
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.220]   into the QAnon set of conspiracy theories.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.500]   But I mean, can you speak to that conspiracy?
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.340]   - Let's put it this way,
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.860]   the general public rich people are inherently suspicious.
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.700]   - Yeah.
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.980]   - Let's put it that way.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.100]   First of all, they've got all that money
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.940]   and exactly how did one obtain it?
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.380]   And I do not of necessity adhere to the view
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.060]   that behind every great fortune, there is a great crime,
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.300]   but there often are.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.100]   There are ways in which it's acquired.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.180]   But I think it's,
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:24.340]   one of the things I think that can happen
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.380]   is particularly when people acquire a huge amount of money.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:32.180]   And I won't name any names,
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.020]   but let's say there are people who perhaps in the tech sphere
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.580]   who coming from no particular background of wealth
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.880]   suddenly find themselves with $600 billion.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.580]   Well, this is the question you would have to ask yourself,
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580]   why me?
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.740]   Because you're one of the rare tiny group of human beings
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.380]   who will ever have that kind of wealth in your hands.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.460]   Even if you are a convinced atheist,
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.260]   I think at some point you have to begin to suspect
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.180]   that the cosmic muffin, providence, whatever it is,
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.920]   put this money in your hands to do what?
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.780]   Achieve great things.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.200]   Just think of all the stuff.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.680]   So you're gonna start a foundation
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   and you're gonna start backing all the things that you like.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.500]   This is, I think there's an element of ego
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.440]   that comes in with it as well.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   And again, it may not be so much what the rich person
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.440]   with a huge amount of money at their disposal
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:33.720]   and a lot of fuzzy ideas about what to do with it
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.340]   can be influenced by others.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.880]   It's always that question as to
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.340]   who's actually manipulating these events.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.040]   What's going on in that regard?
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.520]   And in some way they can be a very useful sucker.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.000]   Find somebody with a lot of money
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.960]   and get them to finance the things
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.320]   that you want them to do.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.800]   The Bohemian Club is, I don't think in and of itself,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   inherently evil or sinister,
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.080]   but it means that there are lots of different people in it
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.400]   who have different agendas.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.620]   It goes back to what I said about how somebody feels
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.520]   about the cremation of care ritual.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.400]   This is either just a waste of time,
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.680]   it's just some sort of silly thing that we're doing,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.100]   or it is something of great importance,
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:30.060]   perhaps even mystical or religious importance,
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:35.120]   because that's ostensibly what it's pretending to be.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.640]   It's always this question as to what degree
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.120]   you begin to play and the play becomes serious.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.200]   That tends to happen a lot.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.960]   - You've studied a lot of cults and occultism.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.480]   What do you think is the power of that mystical experience?
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.760]   - Well, what is broadly referred to,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.440]   we'll get into, what's occultism?
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.280]   What's the occult?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.600]   The occult is the hidden, is all it really means,
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.200]   specifically hidden from sight.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:08.560]   And the basis of it is the idea that what is hidden?
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.860]   Well, what is hidden from us is most of the world,
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:13.040]   most of reality.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.960]   So the basic concept within occultism,
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.880]   the basic concept within most religions,
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.080]   which are approved forms of occultism,
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.360]   is that the world, the physical world that we are aware of,
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.360]   is only a very small part of a much larger reality.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:38.240]   And that what the methods and practices of occultism
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.420]   arguably do is to allow someone to either enter
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.840]   into this larger reality or to access that larger reality
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.420]   for purposes to be exploited here.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.960]   The most interesting statement about,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.240]   and a key element of this becomes the thing called magic.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.580]   Now we all know magic, you know,
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.980]   it's a guy standing on stage performing a trick.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:07.060]   But the interesting thing about a stage magician
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.140]   is that a stage magician is,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.060]   we know when we're watching this, that it's a trick.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:19.060]   Yet we can't really figure out, if he does it well,
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.020]   how that trick is being accomplished
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:25.380]   because it seems to defy physical laws.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.020]   And that's what's fascinating about it.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.660]   So even though you know it's a trick,
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.860]   if you can't figure it out,
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.600]   it has this kind of power of fascination,
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.100]   but it's mimicking something.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:40.700]   Stage magic is mimicking real magic.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.700]   So it's real magic.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.380]   Well, let's go back to Alistair Crowley
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.980]   'cause you know, he always has to come.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.620]   We knew he was gonna come up at some point in this,
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.500]   earlier than that, 'cause he always does.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.780]   - All roads lead to Alistair.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.420]   - All roads lead to Alistair Crowley.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.100]   Alistair Crowley, and I've said this enough
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.140]   so I should be able to get it right,
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.340]   but I'm paraphrasing here.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.540]   He goes, magic, which of course he spelled with a K to L
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:08.540]   or CK, is the art and science
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:13.620]   of causing change to occur in conformity with will.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.440]   So in a way that's sort of mind over matter,
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.380]   but it's the idea that one can, through will,
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.220]   through intention,
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:32.340]   bend reality to make something happen.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.260]   Somebody once put it this way, it's tipping the luck plane.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.660]   And so, you know, you've got some kind of a level plane.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.620]   What you're trying to do is just tip it just a little bit
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.620]   so the marble rolls over one side or another.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.780]   Now that presupposes a lot of things,
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.060]   that is there a luck plane?
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.620]   I don't know, but you know, it's a good sort of idea to have
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:57.620]   but, and here again, don't become overly bothered
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   trying to figure out whether you actually can bend reality.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.840]   Become bothered by the fact that there are people
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.680]   who believe that they can
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.440]   and will go to great efforts to do so,
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.080]   and will often believe they have succeeded.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:24.160]   So it's this effort to make things occur
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.120]   in a particular way, maybe just to sort of nudge reality
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.320]   in one little way or another.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.700]   And that's where things like rituals come in.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:37.240]   Rituals are a way of focusing will and attention.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.180]   We're all there, we're all thinking about the same thing.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.960]   And you have to imagine just how, you know,
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.360]   the pervasiveness of what could be called
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.240]   that kind of magical thinking
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.180]   that we'd have is everywhere.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.800]   So let me give you an example.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.180]   You ever attended a high school football pep rally?
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.240]   Think of what's going on there.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.560]   Okay, your team is going to battle the other team.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.840]   You've now assembled everyone in the gymnasium.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.800]   You've got people who are dancing around
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.440]   in animal totem costumes.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.000]   And what are you chanting?
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.200]   Everyone is supposed to chant that, you know,
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.760]   that the other team dies,
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.280]   okay, that you will be horribly defeated
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.140]   and that our team will be victorious.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.500]   That is a magic ritual.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.680]   The idea is it becomes into this idea
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.880]   that's very popularly about visualizing things,
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.720]   visualizing, manifesting, I love this term.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.440]   You need to manifest your success.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.720]   Well, that's just magic.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.720]   That is trying to cause change in conformity with will.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.520]   So these things can happen
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   without you being even consciously aware of what's going on
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.800]   and you don't need to be
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:57.440]   because if you're all a part of the mob,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.000]   which is there in the gymnasium
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.560]   and you get into this and you get worked up,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.080]   an occultist would argue what you're doing
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.560]   is you're creating a huge amount of energy.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.720]   All of these people are putting energy into something
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.280]   and that energy goes somewhere.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.920]   And maybe you can, maybe, just maybe, you actually can
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.720]   slightly increase the chances of your team's victory.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.440]   Of course, your opponents are having their own ritual
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.120]   at the same time, so whoever has the bigger mojo
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.760]   will apparently win on the team.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.200]   - So that's a, I would say, trivial example of that,
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.440]   but a clear one.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.960]   I do believe that there's incredible power
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.160]   in groups of humans getting together and morphing reality.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.560]   I think that's probably one of the things
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.600]   that made human civilization what it is.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   Groups of people being able to believe a thing
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.440]   and bring that belief into reality.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.920]   - Yes, that's, you're exactly right.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.360]   Bring to conceive of something
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.120]   and then through intention, will,
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.920]   to manifest that into this realm.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.920]   - And of course, that power of the collective mind
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   can be leveraged by charismatic leaders
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.240]   to do all kinds of stuff,
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.280]   where you get cults that do, you know,
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.360]   horrible things or anything.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.800]   - There might be a cult that does good things.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.400]   I don't know, it depends.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.220]   - We usually don't call them cults.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.160]   - We don't call those cults.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.720]   - Exactly, 100%.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.560]   - Without endorsing this entirely,
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.080]   an interesting, you know, one of the questions,
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.520]   what's the difference between a cult and a religion?
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:44.160]   And it has been said that in the case of a cult,
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.480]   there's always someone at the top
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.160]   who knows what's going on, generally,
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.460]   who knows it's a scam.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:56.720]   In a religion, that person is dead.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   So, see, I've just managed to insult every single religion.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.960]   And, but it's an interesting way of thinking about it
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.480]   because I think there is some degree
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.080]   of accuracy in that statement.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.040]   - Do you think, actually,
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.680]   the interesting psychological question is,
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.380]   in cults, do you think the person at the top
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.560]   always knows that it's a scam?
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.160]   Do you think there's something about the human mind
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.400]   where you gradually begin to believe--
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.800]   - Begin to believe your own bullshit?
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.640]   - Yeah.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.460]   - Yes, that's--
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.300]   - That seems to be--
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.400]   - That, again, is part of magic, I think,
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.000]   is believing your own bullshit.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.520]   It doesn't necessarily mean
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.840]   that the head of the cult realized,
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.680]   but there's someone, maybe the second,
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.080]   you know, I always sort of look in the lieutenants.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   Someone probably has an idea about what's going on.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.440]   The other thing that seems to be a kind of dead giveaway
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.600]   for what we would call a cult
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   is what's called excessive reverence for the leader.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.680]   People just believe everything these people say.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.000]   I'll give you an example.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.320]   The first time I ever encountered anything like that
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.040]   was in Santa Barbara, California in the 1970s.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.560]   I was going to grad school,
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.640]   and there was a particular cult locally,
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.960]   which I think was Brotherhood of the Sun.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:24.440]   And it was the same, so there was some guy who was,
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.360]   you know, among the other things,
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.080]   followers were convinced to hand over all their money
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.200]   and personal belongings to him.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.040]   I believe he used part of that money to buy a yacht with.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.000]   Anyway, a lot of it went to him.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.480]   And then, of course, working for free
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.400]   upon different cult-owned business enterprises,
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.440]   of which there are several,
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.800]   and there was a person I knew
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.000]   who became a devoted follower of this,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.880]   and it was, all I could think of at one point
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   was ask them, "What the hell is the matter with you?
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.200]   "I mean, have you lost your mind?
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.280]   "Why would you, what is it that this person
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.520]   "can possibly be providing that you essentially
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.120]   "are going to become a slave to them?"
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.780]   Which is what they were doing.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.600]   And I actually give that credit in a way
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.000]   of sort of sparking my whole interest
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.960]   in things like secret societies.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.880]   And here again, as a disclaimer,
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   I am not now, nor have I ever been,
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]   the member of any fraternal organization,
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.100]   secret society, or cult that I know of.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:35.180]   And that's what interests me about them.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.280]   Because I'm just always trying to figure out
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.960]   why people do these things.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.780]   Like I said, why the robes and the owl?
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.320]   Why? - Yeah.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.080]   - Why do you do that?
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.000]   And it's trying to figure it out.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.280]   I mean, I couldn't even hack the Boy Scouts, okay?
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.360]   That was too much of there.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.400]   Because to me, you join an organization,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.560]   and the first thing that comes along
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.000]   is there's somebody, there are rules,
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.440]   and someone is telling you what to do, okay?
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.720]   I don't like people telling me what to do.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.280]   Spent much of my life trying to avoid that
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.040]   as much as possible.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.280]   And join a cult, there's gonna be someone
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.480]   telling you what to do.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.000]   Join the Bohemian Club, and there's gonna be someone
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.080]   telling you what to do.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.720]   And obviously, a lot of people
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.480]   really get something out of that.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.220]   It becomes, in some ways, it's sort of necessary
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.920]   for them to function.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.240]   But I do not understand it, and my study of it
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.240]   is a personal error to try to understand
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.960]   why people do that.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.680]   - And there's so many reasons.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.400]   Primary of which, I would say, is the desire
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.000]   in the human heart to belong.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.080]   - Yes. - Right.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.280]   - And the dark forms that it takes
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.320]   throughout human history, recent human histories,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.640]   something I'd love to talk to you a bit about.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.000]   If we can go back to the beginning of the 20th century,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.520]   on the German side, you've described
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.240]   how secret societies like the Thule Society
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.740]   lay the foundation for Nazi ideology.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.740]   Can you, through that lens, from that perspective,
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.860]   describe the rise of the Nazi Party?
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.120]   - Well, I guess we could start with
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.980]   what on Earth is the Thule Society?
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:21.400]   So the Thule Society was a small German occult society.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:27.120]   That is, they studied metaphysics,
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.580]   another fancy word for occultism,
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:36.040]   that appeared in Munich around 1917, 1918.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   The key figure behind it was a German esotericist
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:50.840]   by the name of Rudolf von Zebotendorf, okay?
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.040]   Not his real name.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.120]   His real name was Adam Rudolf Glauer.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.240]   He was adopted by a German nobleman
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.040]   and got the name von Zebotendorf,
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.400]   and I like to say that name.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.480]   So I have this real thing about vague, mysterious characters
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.780]   who show up and do things,
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.240]   and trying to figure out who these people are.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.400]   So we're working up in the years
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.200]   sort of prior to the First World War.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.240]   So a decade or so prior to World War I,
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.540]   he spends a lot of time in the Ottoman Empire.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:25.800]   Turkey, there was none in the Ottoman Empire,
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.200]   which was a fairly tumultuous place,
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.640]   because in 1908 and 1909,
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.200]   there was the Young Turk Revolution,
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.160]   and you had a kind of military coup,
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:43.160]   which effectively overthrew the Ottoman sultan
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.920]   and installed a military junta,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.000]   which would go on during the First World War
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.480]   to make its greatest achievement in the Armenian genocide.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.000]   Eventually, he created a genocidal military regime,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.560]   which would lead the country into disastrous First World War
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.280]   which would destroy the Ottoman Empire,
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.120]   out of which modern Turkey emerges, yada, yada, yada.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.160]   - And by the way, we should take a tiny tangent here,
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.640]   which is that you refer to the intelligence agencies
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.880]   as being exceptionally successful,
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.160]   and here in the case of the Young Turks
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   being also very successful in doing the genocide,
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.720]   meaning they've achieved the greatest impact,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.940]   even though the impact on the scale of good to evil
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.160]   tends towards evil.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.800]   - It's one of those things that often comes out
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.480]   of revolutionary situations.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.520]   Revolutions always seek to make things better, don't they?
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.440]   We're going to take a bad old regime,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.960]   you know, the sultan does, you know,
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   and the sultan was bad, I think it's fairly stated.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.240]   Abdul Hamid II was not a, wasn't called a red sultan
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.400]   because of his favorite color type of thing.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.960]   And the idea is that they were going to improve,
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.320]   they were now going to, you know,
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.120]   the Ottoman Empire was a multinational empire,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.080]   they were going to try to equalize
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.920]   and bring in the different groups,
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.520]   and none of that happened, it became worse.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.400]   Okay, in the same way that you could argue
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.360]   that the goal of Russian revolutionaries
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.540]   was to get rid of the bad, old, incompetent,
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.040]   medieval czarist regime
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.080]   and to bring in a new, great, shining future,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.040]   and it became even more authoritarian.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.520]   And the crimes of the imperial Russian regime
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520]   pale in significance of what would follow,
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.680]   in the same way that the crimes of Abdul Hamid pale
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.360]   to when you get to the Young Turks.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.960]   But that wasn't necessarily the intention.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.560]   But, von Zappotendorf was a German businessman
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.240]   who's working in this period,
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.200]   and the whole point here is that the Ottoman Empire
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   in this period is a hotbed of political intrigue.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.280]   You know, all kinds of interesting things about it.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.160]   The Young Turk Revolution is essentially a military coup,
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   but it is plotted in Masonic lodges.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.440]   Okay, I know, technically Masonic lodges
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.440]   are never supposed to be involved in politics,
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.800]   but they are.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.040]   Or, you know, the lodge meeting breaks up
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.600]   and then you plot the revolution.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.480]   So, same group of people, but it's not technically.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.760]   But yes, and there's the Macedonia Risorsa Lodge
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.800]   in Thessaloniki was ground zero
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.440]   for plotting this military coup
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.480]   that was supposed to improve the empire.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.400]   Zappotendorf is, in one way or another,
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.600]   mixed up in all of this,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.200]   or at least he's an observer of it.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.440]   Plus, he's initiated into the Masonic lodges.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.640]   And interestingly enough,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.160]   the fellow who initiates him
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.400]   into one of these Eastern lodges
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.040]   is a Jewish merchant by the name of Ter-Moudi,
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.400]   and who's also a Kabbalist.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.040]   So, Zappotendorf is very, very interested in the occult.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.600]   He's initiated into Eastern Masonic lodges
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.120]   in a period when those same lodges
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.120]   are being used as a center for political intrigue.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:26.000]   He also apparently is involved in gun running,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.240]   which in revolutionary periods is, you know,
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.560]   there's a lot of money to be made off of that.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:36.520]   So, he's connected to various dark businesses
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.000]   in a tumultuous time,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   with connections to politicized Freemasonry and the occult.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:51.800]   Now, in the course of the First World War,
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.960]   he returns to Germany.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.800]   He just shows up.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:04.160]   And it would be my operative suspicion,
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   or theory, that Zappotendorf was working for someone.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.800]   I don't think he just pops up in Munich on his own accord.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.920]   Why does he leave the Ottoman Empire
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.240]   and return to that place?
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.560]   Who's behind him?
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:25.280]   Well, maybe no one, but maybe someone,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.120]   because he does seem to have money at his disposal.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.200]   And he comes into Munich,
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.400]   and he basically takes over
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.520]   this small sort of occult study group.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.480]   Now, the interesting thing is that the Thule Society
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.360]   is really just a branch of another existing,
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.480]   what's called an Areosophist Order,
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.240]   a thing called the German Order, or the Germanen Orden,
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.920]   which is centered in Berlin.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:56.520]   But for some reason, he doesn't want his group
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.560]   to be connected by name with the Germanen Orden,
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.200]   so Thule Society, Thule in this case
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.760]   is a reference to supposedly
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.760]   a mythical Arctic homeland of the Aryan race.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.440]   Okay, apparently they were all snow people
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.920]   who wandered out of the snow at some point.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.120]   It's kind of like a frozen Atlantis.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.640]   So I mentioned these people, the Areosophists,
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.040]   who, which is, you have to practice saying that.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.440]   So what are they?
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.240]   Well, they're a kind of racist,
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.280]   Germanic offshoot of theosophy.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.520]   And I know I'm explaining one thing to explain something,
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.880]   but there's no other way to do this.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.040]   So theosophy was 19th century,
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.000]   very popular and widely modeled occult belief
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.320]   that was founded by a Russian woman
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.160]   by the name of Helena Blavatsky.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:54.000]   She was a medium psychic.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.520]   She supposedly got channelings
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.560]   from the ascended masters.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.720]   The basic story there,
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.240]   they're all of the ascended masters,
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.480]   which are mystical beings
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.640]   that may or may not have once been human.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.480]   They live inside the Himalayas
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.200]   or they float among them on a cloud
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.200]   and they guide the spiritual evolution of humanity.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   What Blavatsky did was to take Western esotericism
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.560]   and blend it with Hindu and Buddhist esotericism,
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.080]   which became very, very sexy in the West, still is.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.600]   Buddhism attracts a lot of people because,
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.080]   well, it's Buddhism.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.240]   It's different, see?
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.920]   So the Mahatmas, the ascended masters
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.120]   were sending her messages,
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.920]   despite the fact that she was later proven
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.080]   pretty much to be a fraud
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.240]   and writing the letters herself.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.680]   Nevertheless, people still went along with this doctrine
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.520]   and it's been widely modified and copied since then.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.920]   So an idea in theosophy
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.600]   was that human spiritual evolution
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.480]   was tied to physical evolution.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.680]   So in the case of Blavatsky,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.560]   Blavatsky never said that Aryans, white people,
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.640]   anything out this were superior.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.240]   She talked about the different root races,
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.840]   but it's just her version of it.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.200]   It's just total gobbledygook
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.280]   that seems to include everyone.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.400]   I'd defy you to make much sense out of it.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.800]   But in the early 20th century,
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   there were different sort of,
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.400]   one of the things that became fashionable,
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.800]   not terribly popular.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.000]   These are small movements with the idea that,
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.480]   well, Germany is a new upcoming country.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.160]   And part of this, I think,
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.040]   was really trying to define who the Germans were.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:45.880]   Because remember, the German Empire,
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.200]   Germany as a political state
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.960]   doesn't come into existence until 1871.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.200]   Prior to that, Germany was a geographic expression,
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.920]   a vaguen, which described a large area in Central Europe
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.640]   where a lot of people who wore leather shorts
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.920]   or something like that,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.800]   and spoke similar German dialects were nominally Germans,
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.920]   but they might be Prussians or Bavarians or,
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.600]   they came in all sorts of varieties and religion.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.880]   There was no German identity.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.320]   But something very similar happened in Italy
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.280]   in the same period.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.720]   I mean, you know, there weren't Italians.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.720]   There were Sardinians and there were Romans
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.040]   and there were Sicilians.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.240]   Umbrians spoke, again, dialects of a similar language,
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.800]   but had never lived, you know,
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.560]   not since the Roman Empire under a single state
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.040]   and really didn't think of themselves as the same.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.440]   So you have to create this artificial thing.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.040]   You have to create Germans.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.440]   There's now a Germany with an emperor.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.440]   And so we're all gonna be Germans.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:54.200]   Well, exactly what is that?
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:25:00.320]   Much of it is an artificial creation.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   You know, you have to decide upon
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.640]   some sort of standard dialect.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.320]   Okay, we'll decide what that is.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.560]   You know, often dialect that only a few people
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.440]   actually speech, and then they will be drilled
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.200]   into children's heads through state schooling programs.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.280]   So I think this is the kind of milieu that it comes out of.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.440]   People were trying to figure out
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.080]   what on earth Germans actually were
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.720]   and the need for some sort of common identity.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.240]   And, you know, that leads to everything
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.440]   like Wagnerian opera.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.240]   Richard Wagner wanted to create a German mythical music.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.160]   So he went back and strip-mined old German myths
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.360]   and cobbled them together into a lot of people
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.320]   standing on stage singing.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.680]   And that was his purpose.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.120]   He was a nationalist.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.840]   He was, in many ways, a kind of racialist nationalist.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.320]   And this was his idea of trying to create
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.920]   out of bits and pieces of the past
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.560]   a newfangled form of German identity.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.200]   So on the more mystical end of this,
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.400]   you had the ideas that, well,
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.800]   Germany must have been created for some special purpose
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.600]   because the Germans must be very special people.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.480]   And we must have some sort of particular destiny.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.840]   And then out of this, you know,
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.040]   the direction this is heading,
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.520]   well, we're all part of some sort of master race
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.160]   with some sort of ties
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.520]   to some sort of great civilization in the past.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.480]   Call it Thule, call it whatever you want to be.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.360]   They basically just invent things
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.800]   and try to attach those to the past.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   And so Ariosophy was the Arianized version of Theosophy.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.640]   And what this did was to take the idea
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.240]   that spiritual and physical evolution
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.920]   had led to the most advanced form of human beings,
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.200]   which were the Arians.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.320]   And the most advanced group of them
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.160]   were, of course, the Germans.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.600]   And this attracted appeal.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.240]   Keep in mind, again, this was not a mass movement.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.680]   This was very much a fringe movement.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.120]   Most people weren't aware of it
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.400]   and weren't particularly interested in it.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.920]   But it had an appeal for those
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.360]   who already had a kind of esoteric bent
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.800]   in some form or another.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.840]   And this is where things like the German Order
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.560]   and their other groups,
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.840]   it was only one of many, sort of grew out of.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:25.200]   And what it was that the Thule Society as a branch,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.640]   the Thule Gesellschaft was supposed to do
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.520]   was to study this.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.360]   It was an esoteric study group.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.760]   And so people would get together
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.200]   and they'd talk about things,
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.120]   probably make more stuff up
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.040]   and all sort of work around this idea
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   of German Arians as the most advanced type of human beings
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.440]   and all the wonderful things that the future would hold.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.720]   And the fact that this was in the midst of a war
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   in which Germany was again,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.520]   fighting as they saw it for its existence,
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.560]   heightened those kinds of tensions as well.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.680]   So my suspicion again,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.200]   is that Siboltendorf in terms of who was behind him,
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.520]   that he was essentially called back to Germany
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.560]   to work either for the Prussian political police
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.000]   or for some aspect of German intelligence or security
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   to try to mobilize occultism or esotericism
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.160]   for the war effort.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.440]   Because again, this is 1918.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.880]   The war, it's gone on way too long.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.760]   Within a few months, Germany will collapse
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.800]   and it will collapse simply from the psychological exhaustion
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.040]   of the population.
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.640]   - So this is almost like to help the war effort
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.240]   with a kind of propaganda,
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.040]   a narrative that can strengthen the will
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:57.880]   of the German people.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.500]   - It will strengthen the will of some people.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.340]   - Some people.
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:04.620]   - You have to try to appeal to different aspects of this.
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:07.200]   But the mystical aspect is one of those things
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.480]   that can be, can have a very powerful influence.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.280]   And the idea is that if we can come up with some kind
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:18.280]   of mystical nationalism, maybe that's one to put it,
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:24.040]   a kind of mystical nationalism that can be exploited
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:24.860]   for the workers.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.520]   At this point, you're kind of grasping at straws.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.880]   And this is a whole period when the Germans
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.980]   are marshaling the last of their forces
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.920]   to launch a series of offensives on the Western Front,
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.840]   the peace offensive, which will initially be successful,
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.120]   but will ultimately fail and lead to a collapse in morale.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.560]   But among the leadership of Germany,
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.040]   it was a recognition, it was that national morale
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:48.880]   was flagging.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:55.020]   And one of the other things that was kind of raising
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:58.240]   its head was what had happened nearby a year,
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.080]   well, the Russian Revolution,
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.660]   which had now brought the idea,
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.020]   which brought another solution to all of this,
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.120]   the idea of revolutionary Marxism.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.900]   Here, we need to remind ourselves
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:12.940]   as to where Marxism comes from, not Russia, Germany.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:16.340]   Where was the largest Marxist party?
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:17.900]   In Germany.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.620]   - And Marx probably expected the revolution
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.020]   to begin in Germany.
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.220]   - Where else?
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:26.700]   - I mean, it's the Soviet Union is not very industrialized.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.540]   Germany is, and so that's where it would probably--
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.380]   - Russia, 5% of the population is industrial workers.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.180]   In Germany, 40% of the population is industrial.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:39.540]   So if any place was like made for Marxism, it was Germany.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.860]   I think that's why it caught on in East Germany so well,
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.460]   'cause it had kind of come home.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:48.620]   And it was a local belief.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.140]   It wasn't something imported by the Russians.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.900]   It was a German invention.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:59.980]   So the Thule Society, one of the things you can see in this
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.700]   is the Thule Society was particularly involved
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.700]   in sort of anti-Marxist or anti-Bolshevik agitation.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.740]   They saw themselves, the Bolsheviks saw them
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.180]   as this whole movement, it was a counter to this.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:19.900]   It was a kind of counter Marxist movement.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:23.820]   - Can we sort of try to break that apart in a nuanced way?
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:28.780]   So it was a nationalist movement.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:32.100]   The occult was part of the picture, occult racial theories.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:37.100]   So there's a racial component, like the Aryan race.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.560]   So it's not just the nation of Germany.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.500]   And you take that and contrast it with Marxism.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.820]   Did they also formulate that in racial terms?
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.220]   Did they formulate that in national versus global terms?
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.880]   Like how did they see this?
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.780]   - Marxism formulates everything by class, okay?
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.340]   People are categorized by class.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.740]   You're either part of the proletariat
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.940]   or you're part of the bourgeoisie or just, you know,
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.260]   you're either part of the proletariat
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.260]   or just some sort of scum, really.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.500]   Needs to be swept into the dustbin of history.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.780]   Only workers count.
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:13.140]   And that was what would take someone who was a nationalist,
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:17.520]   would sort of drive them crazy because their ideas,
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.580]   we're trying to create a German people, you know?
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.240]   We're trying to create a common German identity.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.500]   But what the Marxists are doing
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.520]   is they're dividing Germans against each other by class.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.420]   German workers hate the German bourgeoisie.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.540]   German proletariat is opposed to German capitalists.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:34.480]   We're all, you know,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.680]   we're all trying to fight this war together.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:43.780]   So that was why Marxism in the form,
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:45.240]   particularly in the form of Bolshevism
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:47.160]   was seen as unpatriotic.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.760]   And of course, it was opposed to the war as a whole.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:52.400]   You know, the idea that parroting Lenin
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.840]   was that the war was an imperialist war.
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.000]   And the only thing that was good
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.080]   that was going to come out of it
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.940]   is that the imperialist war,
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.680]   through all of the crises it was creating,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.640]   would eventually lead to a class war.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:06.560]   And that would be good
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.920]   because that would reconcile all of these things.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.880]   But think of this, the two very different versions of this.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.120]   The Bolshevist version, or let's just call it
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.320]   the Marxist version of Germany,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   it was going to be a class society
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.500]   in which we're going to have to have
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.000]   some kind of civil upheaval,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.060]   which will have Germans fighting Germans.
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:31.760]   Whereas the kind of mystical nationalism,
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.040]   the almost kind of religious nationalism
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:36.160]   that Sybiltendorf from the Thule Society
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.800]   had hitched his wagon to,
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.800]   held that Germans are all part of a single racial family.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:47.860]   And that's what must be the most important thing.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:49.460]   And that these can be different ways
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.060]   of trying to influence people.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.320]   It comes down to a matter of political influence.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.900]   So in a sense, I think that what Sybiltendorf
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.780]   from the Thule Society was trying to do,
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:03.100]   at least within Munich,
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:06.700]   was to use this idea of mystical nationalism
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.820]   as a potential rallying point
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.420]   for some part of the population
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.480]   to oppose these other forces,
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.620]   to keep people fighting.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.940]   The war is lost, though, by the,
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.780]   in November, you know, the Kaiser abdicates.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.580]   And essentially, the socialists do take over in Germany.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:29.180]   That's, things come very, very close
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:32.460]   to following the Russian model.
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:37.180]   And you even get the Russian version
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:38.540]   or take on the Bolsheviks,
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.780]   which are the Spartacists,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.340]   who try and fail to seize power early on.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:47.080]   But you do essentially end up with a socialist Germany.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:53.040]   And that then leaves, in the aftermath of the war,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.280]   the Thule Society is sort of the odd man out,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.560]   although they're still very closely connected to the army.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.160]   And here's one of the things that I find interesting.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.800]   When you get into 1919,
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.560]   who is it that's paying Sybiltendorf's bills?
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.580]   It's the army.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.400]   The one thing the German army is absolutely determined to do
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.160]   is to preserve its social position and power.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.160]   And they're perfectly willing to dump the Kaiser to do that.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.340]   That's sort of this deal which is made.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.920]   In November of 1918, Kaiser's abdication,
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.880]   the proclamation of a German republic,
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:38.360]   which, you know, you just had this guy declare it.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.660]   It wasn't really planned.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:44.480]   There's the Ebert-Groener Pact.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.360]   Groener is the chief of staff,
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.960]   general staff at this point.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:55.200]   Friedrich Ebert is the chief socialist politician,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.100]   basically, and they make an agreement.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.400]   And the agreement, basically,
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.320]   is that the army will support Ebert's government
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.960]   if Ebert supports the army,
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.280]   and particularly, that means the continuation
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.440]   of the officer corps and the general staff
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.620]   in one form or another.
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:17.080]   So a deal is made.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.720]   And that, of course, is what will eventually help defeat
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.400]   the Spartacist uprising.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.420]   - Now, was the army doing the similar kinds of things
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:26.920]   that we've talked about with the intelligence agencies,
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.120]   this kind of same kind of trying to control
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.680]   the direction of political power?
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.360]   - The German intelligence landscape
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.640]   in the First World War, is it,
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.480]   is obscure in many ways.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.880]   There are lots of things that are going on.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.720]   You've got,
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.880]   Germany has a military intelligence service
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.960]   called Abteilung, or Section 3B.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.320]   That's just plain military intelligence.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.800]   You know, they're constantly trying
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.600]   to collect military information before the war
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.680]   about the weaponry and plans of the enemies,
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.280]   and then about what the operational plans
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.440]   were during the war.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.880]   It doesn't really go much beyond that, though.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.080]   The German foreign office
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:14.100]   runs a kind of political intelligence service.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:19.980]   And that's the one which is much more involved
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:23.620]   in things like subsidizing subversion in Russia,
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:27.880]   which is one of the things that the Germans sign on to
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.060]   fairly early.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:34.440]   Little diversion here, in 1915,
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.800]   there is a Russian revolutionary
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.800]   who's lived much of his life in Germany,
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.720]   who goes by the code name of Parvus,
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.880]   and he essentially comes to the Germans
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.920]   in Constantinople, interestingly enough, in Turkey.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.960]   He's hanging around there
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.760]   the same time as the Botendorf is there,
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.720]   which I find curious.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.880]   So Parvus, or Alexander Hellpand,
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.120]   to give his actual name,
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.680]   comes in and he goes, "Look,
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.040]   "there's a lot of revolutionaries in Russia,
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.960]   "and there's a lot of mistrust with the regime.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.080]   "We think that the war will increase the contradictions
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.600]   "in Russian society,
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.200]   "and if you give me a lot of marks,
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.280]   "I can finance this revolutionary activity,
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.560]   "and through subversion, I can take Russia out of the war."
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.200]   Well, the Germans are facing a two-front war.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.640]   That sounds great.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.560]   We'll use money in order to...
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.420]   But notice what they're doing.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.260]   The German general staff,
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.600]   a very conservative organization,
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.400]   not a bunch of revolutionaries,
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   are going to finance revolution in an opposing country.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.040]   They are going to finance revolutionary subversion
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.360]   to take Russia out of the war,
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.180]   which basically works.
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.840]   So that gives you another idea
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.880]   as to what the German military is willing to do.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.800]   They're not revolutionaries,
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.660]   but they'll pay revolutionaries to subvert another regime.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.120]   Now you've got the problem
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.240]   is that the revolutionary regime
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.880]   that your money helped bring to power
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:18.880]   is now threatening to extend into your country.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.120]   So the whole question for the army
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.000]   and for others in Germany in 1919
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.920]   is how to keep Germany from going Bolshevik,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.160]   from, in a sense, being hoist by your own petard.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.440]   So the Thule Society,
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.700]   I don't think is a huge part of this program,
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:39.000]   but it is a part of it.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.040]   And it's all an effort to try to keep control.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.640]   And that's why the army is financing them.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.320]   That's even why the army at some point
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.200]   then supplies them with its own propagandists.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.680]   So the Thule Society begins to create,
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.500]   under Subotindor's leadership,
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.160]   what he called the Rings of Thule.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:01.880]   And these are satellite organizations
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.400]   that aren't the society as though,
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.300]   but they're kind of controlled and inspired by it.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:12.400]   And one of those is a thing called the German Workers' Party.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.520]   And the German Workers' Party, again, is local.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.600]   It's not large.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.280]   It's not terribly influential.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.280]   But what does it aspire to be?
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.520]   It aspires to be a party
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.160]   that will bring German workers away
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.800]   from the seductive influence of the Bolsheviks
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.000]   and into a more patriotic position, a patriotic.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.760]   And the way that I describe this
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.320]   is that it's not an anti-communist organization.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.420]   It's a counter-communist organization.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.580]   So you don't create something which completely opposes it.
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.360]   You create something which mimics it,
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.960]   which is ultimately what the German Workers' Party
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.960]   will become is the National Socialist German Workers' Party,
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.160]   known as that term, socialist.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.600]   And that is, in my view,
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.440]   what Nazism is from the beginning.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.120]   It is a counter-communist movement.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.880]   - And by the way, for people who don't know,
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.160]   the National Socialist German Workers' Party
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.760]   is also known as the Nazi Party.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.240]   So how did this evolution happen
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.560]   from those, that complicated little interplay?
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.560]   We should also say that a guy named Adolf Hitler
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.200]   is in the army at this time.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.040]   - Yes.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.640]   Well, here's the way to come into this,
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.400]   'cause remember I said the army was going to supply
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.120]   its own propagandists to help the German Workers' Party
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.920]   and the Thule Society do their work.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.120]   And the propagandists they supply them with
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   is a man who the army trains,
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.480]   sends to classes,
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.960]   to learn the art of public speaking and propaganda.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.720]   And that fellow is Corporal Adolf Hitler.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.040]   - So how does Adolf Hitler connect
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.400]   with the German Workers' Party?
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.280]   - Well, he'd been in the army during the war,
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.400]   the only regular job that he'd ever had.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.680]   Kind of liked it.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.880]   So you often get the view is that,
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.720]   well, at the end of the war,
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.080]   he joined millions of other German soldiers
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:17.920]   who didn't have jobs.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.320]   No, no, he stays in the army.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.080]   He stays in the army until 1921.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.600]   He's on the army payroll at the very time
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.040]   in which he is held to set this up.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.240]   What appears to have happened is this,
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.440]   Subbotnendorff had organized the Thule Society.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.760]   That didn't had, you know,
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.360]   that had tried to oppose.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.360]   There's actually a brief period of time
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.960]   in which the communists actually take over Munich.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.880]   The Bavarian Soviet Republic,
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.960]   which doesn't last very long.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.600]   And eventually the army and volunteers put this down.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.960]   While that's going on, by the way,
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.600]   Hitler is actually sitting in the barracks in Munich,
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.840]   wearing a red armband,
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.360]   because he is technically part of the soldiers
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.080]   who have gone over to the Bavarian Soviet Republic.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:13.200]   He seems to have had flexible interests in this case.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.080]   So once order is restored, so to speak,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.760]   the army comes in and decide that,
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.840]   well, one of the things we need,
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.960]   we need to have people who can lecture soldiers
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.600]   on patriotic topics.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:30.400]   And so there is a particular captain
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.160]   by the name of Karl Mayer, who sort of spots Hitler.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.760]   He later describes him as like a stray dog
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:37.960]   looking for a master.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.520]   Hitler has a knack for public speaking.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.200]   Other soldiers will listen to him.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.640]   Yeah, some people can do that.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.640]   Some people can't.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.280]   Mayer decides that he's a good candidate
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   for further training.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.680]   And so, yes, they bring him in.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.680]   They turned him into what's called a Weimann,
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.960]   a kind of liaison man.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.840]   He's an army propagandist.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.360]   And then you've got this little outfit
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.440]   called the German Workers' Party.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.040]   And essentially what happens is that Hitler is sent in
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.800]   to take over leadership of that, which is what happens.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:19.120]   He shows up, he attends a meeting.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.000]   There are like 50 people there.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.920]   By the way, the topic of the first meeting he's at
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.960]   is how and why capitalism should be abolished, okay,
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.600]   which is not what you might well expect.
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.200]   And because remember, the German Workers' Party
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.040]   is trying to cast itself as a counter-Bolshevism.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.600]   So it's not saying that capitalism is great,
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.440]   which is important.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.280]   Now, capitalism is evil.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.120]   We agree upon that.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   We just agree it has to be destroyed
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.640]   from a nationalist point of view
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.920]   as opposed from some sort of strange
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.480]   internationalist point of view.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:56.720]   So Hitler is essentially, as I see it,
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.840]   sent in by the army as their trained man
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.160]   to assume leadership within this small party
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.160]   and to use it for the army's patriotic propaganda campaign.
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:13.640]   And is his season doing so, even to the name change,
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.720]   to the National Socialist or German Workers' Party?
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.720]   I mean, really, what sounds more red than that?
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.440]   - So the interesting thing here is
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.960]   from where did anti-Semitism seep into this whole thing?
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.040]   It seems like the way they try to formulate counter-Marxism
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.960]   is by saying the problem with capitalism
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.920]   and the problem with Marxism is that
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.920]   it's really Judeo-capitalism and "Judeo-Bolshevism."
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.920]   From where did that ideology seep in?
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.680]   - Well, that's a huge topic.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.040]   Where does anti-Semitism come from?
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.360]   Well, let's start with that term itself,
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   a term which I have really grown increasingly to dislike
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.880]   because it doesn't actually say what it means.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.160]   Anti-Semitism is anti-Jewism.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.180]   That's all it is.
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:15.040]   I'm not sure whether there has ever existed a person
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.880]   who hated Jews, Arabs, and Maltese equally.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.000]   Okay, that's kind of hard to imagine.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.360]   I don't know, but that's technically what that would mean
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.680]   because let's face it, most Semites are Arabs.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.720]   So if you're an anti-Semite,
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.720]   then you don't seem to distinguish Jews from Arabs.
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.700]   Makes no sense.
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:39.320]   The origin of the term is invented by, guess what?
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.880]   An anti-Semite, a guy in the 1870s,
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.560]   a German journalist by the name of Wilhelm Marr,
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.600]   who is, wouldn't you know it, part Jewish himself,
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.280]   and who decides that you really need a better term
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.200]   than Judenhas, Jew-hate, which was the term,
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.440]   'cause that just sounds so inelegant.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.000]   Doesn't it?
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.640]   Okay, what do you wanna call yourself,
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.920]   a Jew-hater or an anti-Semite?
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.680]   See, anti-Semitism, it's got that ism part at the end of it,
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.040]   which means it's a system of belief.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.760]   Anything that has an ism
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.240]   must somehow be scientific and important.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.240]   It's all part of the 19th century obsession
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:25.280]   with trying to bring science
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.480]   into something one way or the other.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.280]   So we're gonna get rid of Jew-hate
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.840]   and we're gonna turn it into anti-Semitism.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:32.640]   And we're only gonna be talking about Jews,
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.680]   but we'll never actually say that.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.680]   And somehow, the invention of a Jew-hater
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:42.240]   to disguise the fact that he's a Jew-hater,
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.000]   even though he's partly Jewish,
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.120]   by inventing the term anti-Semitism worked
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.120]   because everybody has bought it and repeated it ever since.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:55.160]   So I don't know, maybe just because anti-Jewism
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.360]   would just be, is it too direct in some way?
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.480]   Do we have difficulty confronting, actually,
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.120]   what it is that we're talking about?
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.320]   - I do wish terms were a little bit more direct
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.800]   and self-explanatory, yeah.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.280]   Jew-hate is a better term.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.200]   - Well, the question then comes,
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.960]   what exactly do you hate about Jews?
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.480]   And a lot of this has to do with,
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.660]   if you go back part of the 19th century,
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.360]   if Jews were hated, they were hated for religious reasons.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.440]   In Christian Europe, they were hated
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.040]   because they weren't Christians.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.560]   And they existed as the only kind of significant
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:35.360]   religious minority, but other than that,
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.760]   they tended to live separately.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:40.660]   They had little economic influence.
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.600]   Jews tended to live in shtetls in the East,
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   ghettos elsewhere, and they were,
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.400]   some were involved in banking and business,
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   but they sort of remained segregated from much of society.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.680]   That changes when you get to the 19th century,
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.520]   and with what's called Jewish emancipation.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.320]   And that means that between about 1800 and 1850,
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.480]   most European countries dropped the various
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:10.000]   legal or social restrictions against Jews.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.520]   They are assimilated into the general society.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.280]   So ideally, you stop being a German Jew,
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.720]   and you become a Jewish German.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.840]   Those are two very different, important concepts.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.320]   And what that does, of course,
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.700]   is that it opens up the professions,
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:32.000]   business world elsewhere.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.640]   So Jews move, who had been largely
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.240]   within those realms to begin with,
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.800]   they already had a good deal of experience
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.520]   in banking and business, and they move into those areas
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.560]   and professions and become quite visible.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:52.240]   And that's what then creates anti-Semitism.
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.500]   Because in some way, that is seen as part
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:02.500]   of the changes that have taken place.
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:06.660]   And there are a lot of things going on here.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.660]   Part of it has to do with the kind of wrenching
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:10.820]   social and economic changes that took place
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.240]   with industrialization.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.620]   So one of the things to keep in mind
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.400]   is that in the process of industrialization,
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.380]   just like today, whole classes of people
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:26.220]   were made extinct economically, craftsmen, for instance.
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:28.580]   So when factories came along and began
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:30.680]   to produce things with machines,
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:33.820]   all the craftspeople who had made those things previously
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:40.100]   are now unemployed or go to work as wage labor in factories.
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:46.020]   So there are winners and losers in industrialization.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:50.520]   And what people saw in Germany and elsewhere
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.540]   is that among this new sort of rising capitalist elite,
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.780]   among these new professions, among the bureaucrats
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.100]   that are coming out of these burgeoning states,
[01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:04.100]   there were visibly a fair number of Jews.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:09.060]   So in some way, the rise of Jews in the minds
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.180]   of many people were connected to all
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.540]   of the other bad things that were going on.
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:16.480]   You know, the world was changing in a way we don't like.
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.580]   And seemingly, the Jews are prospering
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:21.700]   while I am not.
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.540]   And that was true in Germany and elsewhere.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.100]   Jews became highly visible in the professions.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.140]   They became very visible in banking.
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:32.780]   They became visible in legal profession.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:35.260]   They became visible in the medical profession.
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.980]   And those are people that a lot of people
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:41.620]   would come in contact with, bankers, lawyers, and doctors.
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:43.460]   They were not the majority there,
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:48.460]   but vastly overrepresented
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:50.460]   in terms of the general population,
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:54.400]   and especially within the cities.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:59.260]   So in that sense, the roots of antisemitism to me
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.380]   is that Jews in Germany and elsewhere,
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.260]   and not just in Germany by any means,
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.380]   France, Britain, everywhere else,
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:08.460]   became identified with the bad changes
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.840]   that were taking place.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:16.140]   And, but you also found that Jews
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.780]   were not only prominent among capitalists,
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:23.740]   they were also prominent in the socialist movement as well.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.260]   So one of the things you could look around,
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.540]   we return to Germany in 1919
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.700]   in the aftermath of World War I,
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.220]   and you look around in Bavaria or elsewhere,
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:35.300]   you tend to find that there are a lot of Jews
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:38.900]   in visible positions on the German left.
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:44.140]   Rosa Luxemburg is but one example of that.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.020]   Eugen Levine, some of them came in from Russia.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.060]   When the Soviets send a representative
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:54.300]   to Germany in this period, it's Karl Radek, a Jew.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.860]   So it wasn't difficult to exploit that,
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:03.860]   to argue that just as the ranks of capitalism
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.980]   was full of Jews, the ranks of Bolshevism
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:11.780]   or of the revolutionary left were full of Jews,
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.660]   because you could easily go around
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:16.460]   and distinguish a great many of them.
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.660]   They don't have to be the majority,
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.540]   they just have to be numerous, prominent,
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:24.440]   and visible, which they were.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.840]   So this provided you a,
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:31.580]   in the case of the propaganda of the German army,
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.660]   the type of stuff that Hitler was spewed out,
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:36.060]   they could put all the anti-capitalist rhetoric
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:36.900]   in there if they wanted to.
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:39.060]   The army was never gonna overthrow capitalism,
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:41.300]   and the capitalists knew they weren't gonna do it.
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:45.740]   So go ahead, talk shit about us, we don't really care.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:47.480]   That's not gonna, because we know that the army
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:49.180]   would prevent that from happening.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:54.660]   The way to then undermine the real enemy,
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:57.660]   it was a scene, the revolutionary left,
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.700]   was to point out the Jewish influence there.
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:02.620]   I mean, look at Russia.
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.780]   Well, Lenin's not, but Trotsky, there he is.
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:07.180]   Look, there's a Jew, there's one.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.420]   Radek is a Jew.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:10.780]   It wasn't hard to find him in that regard.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.460]   - You gave a lecture on the protocols
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:17.780]   of the elders of Zion.
[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:20.040]   It's why they consider it to be the most influential work
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:23.080]   of anti-Semitism ever, perhaps.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.720]   Can you describe this text?
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:30.700]   - Well, the protocols of the alerted elders of Zion
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:36.340]   is probably one of the most troublesome
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:39.800]   and destructive works of literature that has ever emerged.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:47.560]   And yet, its origins remain obscure.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:50.140]   So you get a whole variety of stories
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:51.720]   about where it came from.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.140]   So the one story that is often is that it was the work
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:58.460]   of the Okhrana, the Russian secret police,
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:03.460]   and in particular, it was all crafted in 1904 and 1905
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:10.140]   in Paris, and there's a whole description
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.140]   of Pyotr Raczkowski, who was the supposedly the chief
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:19.420]   of the Okhrana at the time, was the man behind it.
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:22.060]   Another fellow by the name of Matvei Golovinsky
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.300]   was the drafter of it.
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.300]   And that they had this document written
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:34.100]   by a French political writer from some decades back
[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:38.620]   called "Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu,"
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:42.220]   which they were then adapting.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.700]   Usually, it's argued that they plagiarized it
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:49.820]   into the protocols, and none of that is really true.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:53.700]   I mean, the first part about it is that at the time
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:55.740]   this supposedly took place, Raczkowski wasn't working
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:59.380]   for the Okhrana, he'd been fired, and he wasn't in Paris.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:01.900]   And the whole situation which is described
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.940]   couldn't have taken place because the people
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.420]   who did it weren't there.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.780]   It's a story.
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:11.300]   But it provides a kind of explanation for it.
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:15.700]   So the protocols emerge, so you always have to go back.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.900]   This is one of the things that I have found
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:26.280]   always useful in research, is go back to the beginning.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.480]   Find the first place this is mentioned,
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.860]   or the first version, or the first iteration.
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.420]   Where does it start?
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:41.900]   So you go back to St. Petersburg, Russia, around 1903.
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:46.620]   There is a small right-wing anti-Semitic newspaper
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.120]   published there called Znamya, Banner.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:54.620]   And it publishes in a kind of serial form
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.100]   a work it doesn't credit with any original author.
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:04.900]   And this is the first version of the protocols
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.820]   of the learned elders of Zion.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.580]   But what it's actually describing
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:14.740]   is a Judeo-Masonic plot to rule the world.
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:17.820]   Those two terms are always combined together.
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:19.380]   And in fact, in the earlier version,
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:23.840]   there's far more mentions of Freemasons than there are Jews.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:31.740]   And the publisher of Znamya is closely connected
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:35.580]   to a thing called the Union of Russian People,
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:40.160]   the Union of Russian Men, which ostensibly existed
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:42.980]   to defend the empire against subversion,
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:45.860]   and particularly against what it thought
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:48.260]   was Jewish subversion, when they also argued
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:50.620]   that the prominence of Jews in revolutionary movements
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:52.460]   somehow proved that this was, in some way,
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:53.820]   a Jewish revolution.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:56.380]   But again, this is not a mainstream newspaper.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:58.620]   It's not appealing to a mainstream population.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.300]   Very few people saw it.
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.900]   But this is where it appears.
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:05.380]   Now, keep in mind, that's two or three years
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:08.380]   before it's usually said to have been written.
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.720]   Or the other version is that there's this crazy priest
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.300]   by the name of Sergei Niles, and he wrote it,
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:18.300]   or actually appended it as an appendix to his work in 1905.
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.980]   Now, it was around before that.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:24.580]   So Niles didn't create it, it wasn't drafted in Paris
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:27.140]   in 1904, 1905.
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:29.980]   It was serialized in an obscure,
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:34.540]   right-wing Russian newspaper, 1903.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:39.540]   - And by the way, we should say that these are 24 protocols.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:42.420]   - Well, it varies.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:47.420]   - It varies, that are, I guess, supposed to be meeting notes
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:53.500]   about the supposed cabal where the Jews and Freemasons
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.420]   are planning together a world domination.
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:58:59.660]   But it's like meeting notes, right?
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:02.300]   - Protocol, which are, Russian term,
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:03.980]   basically for notes of a meeting.
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.660]   - Yeah.
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.180]   - Well, it's notes of a meeting.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.700]   These are the goofiest things I've ever seen.
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:12.500]   Because what you've got here, it's not notes.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.620]   No one takes notes from a meeting that way.
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:17.940]   What you've got is like the exposition
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.260]   of a Bond villain, right?
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:22.660]   It's all of this, boy, oh, then we're gonna do this.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.100]   And the last thing you wanna do is lay out your,
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:26.820]   if you've got a plan for world domination,
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:29.780]   my suggestion would be don't write it down.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:34.940]   So it's not notes of a meeting.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:38.140]   It's, again, it's another sort of narrative
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:40.380]   or story that's being told.
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:45.140]   It bears no resemblance to the dialogue in hell
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:48.340]   between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.140]   But what it is, the best thing,
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.900]   it's not particularly readable in some ways.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:57.140]   There was an Italian writer by the name of Cesare Michalis
[01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:01.700]   who wrote a book, translated in English,
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:03.700]   called The Non-Existent Manuscript.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:08.500]   And what it is is that he takes the different versions,
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:11.580]   starting with the 1902, 1903 versions,
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:12.780]   and looks through the other ones,
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:14.620]   and he tries to, in the process,
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.020]   to reconstruct what he thinks the original might have been.
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.980]   But the other thing he does, which was fascinating to me,
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:27.020]   is that he takes this whole sort of initial text,
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:31.180]   and in bold type, he indicates the paragraphs,
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.980]   but more often sentences or phrases
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:37.460]   that appear to be identical from the Jolie work.
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:41.740]   And they're just scattered throughout it.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:45.620]   There's no particular rhyme or reason to it.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:48.140]   You don't plagiarize that way.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.580]   I mean, who does that?
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:52.820]   It's a sentence here, a sentence there,
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:57.620]   which has led to a peculiar theory of mine,
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:00.060]   which, of course, I will have to expound upon,
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:02.100]   which is that I think that the original author
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:05.340]   of the Protocols was the same Maurice Jolie.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:09.860]   I think what someone stumbled across
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:14.580]   was a work which he wrote and never published,
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.860]   and which he just drew.
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:19.620]   It's exactly what someone would do
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:24.300]   working from your own kind of material.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.020]   Because I've written things,
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:27.500]   and then taken what I've written,
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.460]   and then sort of repackaged that into something else.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.580]   - Sentence here, sentence there.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.340]   - Yeah, and the same sort of thing comes out.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.300]   Only sort of bits and pieces of it remain.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:39.060]   So why would Jolie have done that?
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:41.860]   Jolie was, we're talking about a man
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:46.860]   whose career basically spanned the 1850s to 1870s.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.940]   He's an obscure figure.
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:54.700]   I'm not even totally sure he existed.
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:57.060]   I mean, but it's one of those things,
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:58.580]   you go looking for him.
[02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:00.400]   - I love that you're a scholar of people
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.940]   that just kind of emerge out of the darkness.
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:05.340]   - They just come from nowhere.
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.140]   - And there's the Ocrana there also.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:08.180]   And we should also say this was,
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:09.700]   I guess the original would be written,
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.540]   I mean, what's the language of the original, Russian?
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.380]   - Russian.
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.180]   But my hunch is that that's adopted from a French version.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.220]   First of all, they're constantly harping on Freemasons,
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:21.940]   which wasn't nearly as a big idea there.
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:25.180]   If you go back to France in the 1890s,
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.420]   there's some big scandals.
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:27.900]   Well, there's the Dreyfus scandal,
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:29.260]   well, we got that, all right,
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:30.900]   where you've got a Jewish officer
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.180]   on trial for being a traitor, all right.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:36.100]   So that was, so you bring in the whole Jewish element,
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:39.520]   Jews is disloyal, Dreyfus case, 1894.
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.540]   Earlier, you had the Panama scandal,
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.060]   which was this huge investment scandal
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:48.700]   when the Panama Canal Company in Paris collapsed.
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:51.140]   And again, many of the major players in that work,
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.300]   Jewish financiers.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:57.380]   And then you've got the Taxel hoax.
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:02.060]   So the Taxel hoax was the work of this guy,
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.560]   his real name was, I think, Jogan Paget.
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:08.160]   He was kind of a French journalist.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:11.380]   He started out writing porn.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.780]   So, I mean, he wrote things like "Sex Lives of the Popes"
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:17.800]   and "The Erotic Bible" and various things of that kind.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.460]   He was a Catholic, broke with the Catholic Church,
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.420]   wrote bad stuff about the Popes,
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:27.860]   and apparently became a Freemason for a while,
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:30.580]   and then supposedly recanted his evil ways,
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:32.500]   went back to the church,
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.420]   and then under the name Leo Taxel
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:37.080]   began writing these whole series of articles,
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.880]   basically arguing that there was
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:42.840]   a Masonic-Satanic conspiracy,
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:46.340]   run, by the way, by an American, Albert Pike.
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:50.960]   And this also included child sacrifice.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.500]   It's got "Pizzagate" as well,
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:56.240]   by a high priestess, Diana Vaughn.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.560]   And so there's like child sacrifice,
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.200]   weird, roby, bohemian grove stuff,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.640]   and the Freemasons are devil worshipers,
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.440]   going back to the Knights Templars,
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:09.600]   and so there's a thing called "The Devil in the 19th Century"
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:11.880]   and "The Secrets of Freemasonry."
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:14.740]   And this became a bestseller in France.
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.520]   So France is just obsessed
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.800]   with all of these kinds of conspiracies.
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:22.140]   So evil Satanic Freemasons,
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:25.720]   evil Jewish financiers, Dreyfus,
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:28.760]   this is the brew where all of this comes.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.360]   So I wanna figure out how Freemasons
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.320]   and Jews get connected together.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:36.320]   France is the place where this happens.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:39.580]   Now, Taxel, or Jogon Paget,
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:42.040]   eventually pulls another interesting thing in this.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.960]   Around 1897, critics argue that he's making this stuff up
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:49.560]   and demand that he present Diana Vaughn,
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:52.660]   supposed Satanic high priestess, toddler killer.
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:55.320]   And he says, "Oh, we're gonna have a press conference.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.000]   She'll appear and say all of this stuff
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.680]   as she returns to the church and possibly becomes a nun."
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:03.580]   And so people show up,
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:05.720]   high figures in the Catholic church shows up,
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:07.400]   and he does, no Diana Vaughn,
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.880]   and Jogon Paget goes, "It's all a hoax.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.760]   I made it up.
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.320]   You're all a bunch of idiots for believing it."
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.920]   Okay, you, members of the church especially,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.800]   just what gullible morons you are.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:20.560]   And that's it.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:21.380]   He confesses it.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.220]   To this day, however, you will find people
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:25.640]   who will insist that it's actually true
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:27.840]   because they desperately want it to be true.
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:33.520]   But this is, I think, the milieu that,
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.760]   I like that word, apparently, that this comes out of,
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:41.600]   and this is this whole kind of unhealthy mix.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:45.200]   So France, to me, is the only place
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:46.680]   that in the decade preceding it
[02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:49.600]   that something like this would be concocted.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.600]   So it was either created
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:54.460]   by some sort of unknown person there,
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:58.920]   but I still think that even though he dies in like 1879,
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:03.920]   that in Maurice Joly's troubled career,
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:10.920]   he went from being an opponent of French emperor,
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:14.560]   Napoleon III, which is what the whole dialogues
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:15.740]   was written against.
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:22.960]   And then he was, for a time, a close political ally
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.180]   of a French politician by the name of Adolphe Cremieux.
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:32.880]   So Adolphe Cremieux, what's he got going for him?
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:34.960]   Well, he was kind of a radical politician.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.920]   He was an opponent of Napoleon III.
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.840]   He was a Freemason.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.600]   Oh, and he was Jewish.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:45.280]   In fact, at one point, I think he was actually the head
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:49.280]   both of the Scottish right in France,
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:56.360]   and an important figure in the Alliance Israelite,
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.320]   okay, the Jewish organization in France.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:03.800]   So he was publicly, very prominently Jewish and Masonic.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:06.920]   So someone else who would have linked them together.
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:09.440]   Joly, as he did with virtually everyone,
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.600]   this was a guy whose life largely consisted
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:14.000]   of dual threats and fistfights.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000]   So he gets angry at Cremieux
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:24.840]   and it's exactly the type of thing that he might write
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.360]   to vent his spleen about it.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:33.320]   But he died, probably a suicide.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.000]   That's kind of difficult to tell.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.520]   In obscurity, his son seems to have inherited
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:44.920]   most of his literary works.
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:51.520]   And his son then became a journalist
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.800]   to work for newspapers in France in the 1890s,
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:57.320]   but was also associated with some people
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:59.440]   on the fringes of the Okhrana
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:04.180]   or the Russian press in France.
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:08.680]   So one of the little things that had happened by this time
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:12.440]   is that France and Russia had become allies,
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.920]   even though their political systems
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:15.560]   are completely incompatible.
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:20.040]   And so the Russians were using money
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:23.000]   to subsidize French newspapers
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.820]   that were championing the alliance between the two.
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.080]   Russian meddling.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:30.440]   Okay, no, they're just paying
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.520]   to have the right kind of newspapers come out.
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:33.840]   So there's this whole connection
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:37.280]   between the kind of Russian journalistic world
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:39.080]   and the French journalistic world
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:43.160]   and all of these scandals which are going on
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.960]   and Jolie's son, and then 10 years down the road,
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.920]   this thing pops up in a newspaper in St. Petersburg.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:56.920]   That's where I think the origins lay.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:00.760]   - Why do you think it took off?
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.640]   Why do you think it grabbed
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:06.360]   a large number of people's imaginations?
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.200]   And even after it was shown to be
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.440]   not actually what it's supposed to be,
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.480]   people still believe it's real?
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.560]   - Well, it doesn't take off immediately.
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.640]   Okay, it never receives any kind of wide,
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:21.920]   I mean, nobody much reads the first edition of it.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.840]   When it's re-edited, it keeps getting,
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.280]   there are something like 18 or 19 different versions
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:29.120]   as it goes through.
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:29.960]   I mean, it gets, you know,
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:34.320]   people leave this protocol out or leave another one.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.120]   As time goes on, there's more and more emphasis on Jews
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.280]   and less and less on Freemasons.
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.640]   So it's sort of, and the whole thing could have begun
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.720]   as an anti-Masonic tract.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.360]   I mean, you could leave Jews out of it entirely
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:51.080]   and just turn it into a Masonic plot to rule the world.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:52.880]   But let's just throw them in as well,
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.980]   since the two things are already being combined elsewhere.
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:59.760]   It doesn't become a big deal
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.680]   until really after the First World War,
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:05.720]   because the initial versions of it are all in Russian.
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.760]   And yeah, let's face it.
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:09.400]   While that's widely read in Russia,
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.880]   it's not much read anywhere else.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:12.920]   It's a different alphabet.
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:15.440]   Nobody can even see what it means.
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:18.520]   So it has no particular influence outside of Russia,
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.440]   but then you get to 1919
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:23.520]   and you get all these different versions of it.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:27.000]   So suddenly you get two English versions in the US,
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.800]   another English version in Britain,
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:32.560]   a German edition, a French edition, a Dutch edition.
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.000]   Everybody is coming up with these things.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.020]   So it's not until in the immediate aftermath
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:41.720]   of the First World War that this metastasizes
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.680]   and it begins to show up
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.820]   in all of these different foreign editions.
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:52.040]   And I think that it just has to do with the changes
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:54.880]   that have taken place during the war.
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:58.680]   One of the things that people began looking for was that,
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:10:59.920]   why was there a war?
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.840]   And we just had this whole disastrous war
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.940]   and the world has been turned upside down.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.180]   So there has to be some kind of explanation for that.
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:09.000]   I don't know.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.580]   And one of the things this offered to see,
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.940]   there's this evil plan.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:14.900]   There's this evil plan that has been put into motion
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:18.240]   and this could possibly explain what's taking place.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:23.700]   The reason why the protocols were, I think,
[02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:28.420]   widely bought then and why they still are in many ways
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:30.820]   is the same reason that the tax hole hoax
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:32.060]   I was talking about was.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:35.840]   Because it told a story that people wanted to believe.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:39.900]   So in France in the 1890s,
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:43.980]   there was widespread suspicion of Freemasons.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:48.980]   It was seen as a somewhat sinister secretive organization,
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.540]   certainly secretive.
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:56.460]   And there was also the same sort of generalized prejudices
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:03.020]   about Jews, clannish, distinct, too much influence,
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:05.300]   all of the things that went on.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:09.500]   So it was sort of easy to combine those two things together.
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:14.340]   And even though Taxel admits it was a hoax,
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:17.440]   there were those who argued that this is just too,
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.460]   it's too accurate.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:21.240]   It describes things too completely to be a hoax.
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:24.740]   And then you get the same arguments.
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:28.180]   In fact, I've heard the same arguments with the protocol.
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:31.460]   I don't even buy this as an example of plagiarism
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:32.540]   because you can't actually prove
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:35.140]   what's being plagiarized in any sense.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:39.800]   To me, the protocols are a prime example
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:42.940]   of what I call a turd on a plate.
[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:45.900]   These things crop up.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.300]   I have to explain that now.
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:48.140]   - Yeah, please.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.340]   - But I have to.
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:50.400]   What is a turd on a plate?
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.600]   Well, a turd on a plate is a turd on a plate.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:56.620]   Suppose you come in and there's a plate sitting on the table
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:58.140]   and there's a turd on it.
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:12:59.980]   Now, the first thing you're gonna want is,
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:01.420]   is that a turd?
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:02.860]   Is it a human turd?
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.540]   Where did it come from?
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:06.720]   Why would someone poop on a plate?
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.900]   There are all these questions that come to mind.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:10.240]   It makes no sense.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:14.080]   But that's what you come, it's just there.
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.300]   I don't know where it came from.
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.340]   I don't know why, but there's a turd on a plate
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:24.580]   and that's what the protocol is, that they're just there.
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.400]   - But the reality is, just like with a turd on a plate,
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:29.000]   you take a picture of that in modern day
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.920]   and it becomes a meme, becomes viral,
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.800]   and becomes a joke on all social media
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.840]   and now it's viewed by tens of millions of people
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.760]   or whatever, it becomes popular.
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:39.660]   So wherever the turd came from,
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:43.560]   it did captivate the imagination.
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:44.400]   - Yeah.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.240]   - It did speak to something.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.240]   - But it seemed to provide an explanation.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:51.980]   Can you just speak to Jew hatred?
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:56.440]   Is it just an accident of history?
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:59.360]   Why was it the Jews versus the Freemasons?
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:04.360]   Is it the collective mind searching
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:10.440]   for a small group to blame for the pains of civilization
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.920]   and then Jews just happened to be the thing
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.680]   that was selected at that moment in history?
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.240]   - It goes all the way back to the Greeks.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:22.320]   Let's blame them.
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:28.920]   So one of the first occasions you find the idea
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:34.480]   that Jews are a distinct, mean-spirited, nasty people,
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:43.240]   goes back to a Greco-Egyptian historian named Manetho.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.800]   This is around, I think, 300 BC, early.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:54.840]   Can't even rope the Romans into this one.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.040]   So Manetho is trying to write a history
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.680]   of the dynasties of Egypt.
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.720]   I think his history of dynasties of Egypt
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.960]   still is one of the basic works in this,
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.000]   but he tells this whole story,
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.800]   which essentially describes the kind of first blood libels
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:15.800]   that the Jews to celebrate their various religious holidays
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:19.360]   would capture Greeks and fatten them up in the basement
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:20.600]   and then slaughter them and eat them
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:22.120]   or drain their blood or do something.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:25.080]   Yeah, it's just the sort of earlier version of that kind.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:30.600]   Also, I think it repeats the sort of Egyptian version
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:33.440]   of the exodus out of Egypt,
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:37.000]   which is quite different than the biblical version.
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.720]   In this case, they stole all the stuff
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:45.520]   out of the Egyptians' houses and ran off into the desert.
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.120]   The Jews stole all the stuff and ran off.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:47.960]   Yeah, Hebrews.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:50.120]   Hebrews robbed the Egyptians.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:51.800]   They were taken in.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.760]   We took them in and sheltered them, gave them jobs,
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:59.960]   and then they stole all the jewelry and ran away.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.400]   We didn't even chase them.
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.560]   We were glad to see them gone.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.360]   So, it's a different narrative on that story.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.720]   But it essentially portrays the Jews as being hostile.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:15.720]   You know, they don't like other people.
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:21.820]   They're contemptuous of other people's religions,
[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:22.660]   the rest of it.
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:25.180]   And see, the Greeks tended to think of themselves
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.460]   as being extremely cosmopolitan.
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:30.640]   Now, the Greeks ran across people worshiping other gods.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.000]   They go, "Oh, those are just our gods
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.560]   "and they're different names."
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:36.480]   Everything was sort of adjusted into their landscape.
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:42.120]   So, you end up with that kind of hostility,
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:44.080]   which was there at the time.
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:47.760]   And that was probably influenced also
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:50.920]   by some of these earlier rebellions
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:53.880]   that had taken place in Egypt.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.080]   During the Roman period,
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.080]   you not only have the Judean rebellion in 70 AD,
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.280]   but you have a couple of other uprisings in North Africa,
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.040]   and they're very bloody affairs.
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.320]   And in some cases,
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.280]   Jews begin massacring other people around them.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:12.280]   They start killing the Greeks.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.560]   The Greeks start killing them.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:17.360]   So, there was a fair amount of, from that period on,
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:19.240]   a certain amount of bad blood,
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.240]   of mutual contempt between Greeks or between Hellenes,
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:24.600]   between the people who became Hellenized,
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:28.240]   as the Romans would be, and the Jews.
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:32.960]   And the Romans also seems to have developed
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.080]   much of that idea.
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:37.640]   They consider Judea as being a horrible place
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:42.640]   to have to govern, inhabited by a stubborn, obnoxious people,
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:47.520]   not well-liked.
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:51.220]   So, that's really where you see
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:55.680]   the earliest version of that.
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.400]   And the reasons for it would be
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.120]   complicated.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.560]   What you could say is that going back to Manetho
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.240]   and to the Roman period,
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:13.200]   Jews, Judeans frequently experienced difficulties,
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.000]   conflicts with other people living around them.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.640]   And part of that probably had to do with the diaspora,
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.760]   which was the movement.
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:23.840]   Well, you know, you get the idea.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.320]   The Romans came and they kicked everybody out,
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:26.160]   which they didn't.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.880]   Jews had been leaving Judea,
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.760]   since it was a poor, limited area,
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:31.760]   and moving into areas like North Africa,
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.360]   Egypt, Cyrenaica, all the way into Southern France.
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.960]   They moved widely around the Roman Empire.
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:41.960]   So, that sense of both distinctness and hostility
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.320]   existed since ancient times.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:52.640]   So, it wasn't just the attitude of the church towards Jews
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:57.440]   was mixed by, well, one of the ideas, of course,
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.040]   is that at the end of time,
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:02.040]   just before the second coming,
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.200]   one of the signs,
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:06.280]   how are we gonna know that Jesus is going to return
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.400]   and the world is going to end?
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.000]   Well, the Jews will all convert.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.520]   There will be a mass conversion.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:14.120]   They'll sort of see the light.
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.240]   Now, so there have to be Jews around to do that,
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:19.320]   or we won't, you know, it's like a canary in a coal mine.
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:21.720]   You have to have them there to tip it off.
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:24.240]   So, that was one of the arguments as to why,
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.080]   within the church,
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:28.100]   as to why Jews would not be forcibly converted,
[02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:32.040]   beyond the fact that it's just kind of bad policy
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.480]   to forcibly convert people
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.800]   because you don't know whether it's sincere.
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:41.800]   But they need to be preserved as a kind of artifact,
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:50.040]   which will then redeem itself at the end of time.
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:54.080]   It's not something which is encouraged.
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:56.140]   It predates Christianity.
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:20:01.840]   And then Christianity, of course, in its own way,
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.840]   just sort of plagiarizes the whole Jewish thing, doesn't it?
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:10.780]   I mean, I hesitate to use that term,
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:11.920]   but that's what you do.
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:14.240]   It's just like, well, we're the Jews now.
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.520]   Okay, you used to have a unique relationship with God,
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:18.320]   but now it's been passed over to us.
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.320]   And so, thanks for the Bible.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.480]   I can remember that.
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:26.680]   And my mom's side,
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:29.300]   I was periodically exposed to Sunday school.
[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:33.800]   And pretty much, the Old Testament was always presented
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:38.440]   as if somehow it was the history of like,
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:42.360]   for lack of a better term, Europeans in some way.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:44.080]   It was sort of a Christian history.
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:46.120]   It was all the prequel to that.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.180]   And there'd be some sort of,
[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:51.040]   first, the term Hebrew was always used, never Jews.
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:52.520]   So, the ancient Hebrews,
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.920]   and somehow the Hebrews just sort of became the Christians.
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.840]   And I don't know, the Jews just got,
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:59.840]   they didn't get a memo or something.
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:01.560]   - So, it's basically like Christianity,
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:05.080]   the prequel is the Old Testament.
[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.800]   - Well, they just sort of take over.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.140]   Okay, we have the special dispensation now.
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:10.240]   Thank you very much.
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.540]   You're an artifact.
[02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:14.760]   - So, it's interesting.
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:18.400]   So, this whole narrative that I would say
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:20.680]   is kind of like a viral meme,
[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:26.000]   started, as you described, in 300 BC.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000]   It just carried on in various forms and morphed itself
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.320]   and arrived after the Industrial Revolution
[02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:38.320]   into a new form to the 19th and 20th century,
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:41.680]   and then somehow captivated everybody's imagination.
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:43.720]   - I think that modern antisemitism
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.040]   is very much a creation of the modern world
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:49.680]   and the Industrial Revolution.
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:53.300]   It's largely a creation of Jewish emancipation.
[02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:58.180]   It's the nasty flip side of that, okay?
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:02.040]   All of the restrictions are thrown off,
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:06.400]   but now also you become the focus of much more attention
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:09.600]   than what you had before.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:14.600]   - You know, prior to that, you had the kind of ghettoization,
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:17.440]   which worked both ways.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:21.760]   I mean, there were rabbis who praised the ghettos
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:25.600]   as a protection of Jews against the outside world,
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:30.560]   because inside, we can live our life as we wish,
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.560]   and we're unmolested.
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:38.320]   Whereas, if we were, the great fear is that
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:41.640]   if we were sort of absorbed into this larger world,
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:43.360]   we'll lose our identity.
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:46.600]   That sort of question comes up in the 18th century
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:50.400]   in things like the Haskalah Movement in Germany,
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:51.840]   'cause the German Jews were always
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.440]   at the sort of cutting edge of assimilation and modernity.
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.680]   Moses Mendelssohn was an example of that,
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:01.360]   arguing that, you know, we just need to become Germans.
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:04.720]   So, you know, as much as possible,
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:08.280]   the synagogue should look like Lutheran churches,
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:14.560]   everything, things should be given in good German,
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:17.400]   and that's the way, we need to become Jewish Germans.
[02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:20.080]   We don't want to become a kind of group of people
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.520]   who are apart in that way,
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:27.520]   and that has created great tensions ever since.
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:31.480]   You know, one of the essential points, it seems to me,
[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:34.920]   in anti-Semitism, anti-Jewism,
[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:36.600]   is that all the Jews are in it together.
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:37.440]   Isn't that one of the things?
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:38.640]   Okay, they're always talking about
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:41.520]   as if they're a collective, Jews this, Jews that,
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:44.680]   as if it's a single, undifferentiated mass of people
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:47.660]   who all move and speak in the same way.
[02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:53.560]   From my personal experience, not being Jewish,
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:59.240]   it's incredibly diverse.
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:01.200]   In many ways, really, one of the things
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:04.520]   that anti-Semitism proposes is a continuity
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:09.520]   or a singularity of Jewish identity that never existed.
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:13.960]   Just like you said, in one hand, there's a good story.
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:16.080]   In the other hand is the truth,
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:18.480]   and oftentimes, the good story wins out,
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:20.600]   and there's something about the idea
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:23.120]   that there's a cabal of people, whatever they are.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:27.240]   In this case, our discussion is Jews seeking
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:29.800]   world domination, controlling everybody.
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:32.200]   It's somehow a compelling story.
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:35.520]   It gives us a direction of a people's to fight,
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:39.160]   of a people's to hate, on which we project our pain,
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.140]   'cause life is difficult.
[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:44.280]   Life, for many, for most, is full of suffering,
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:45.660]   and so we channel that suffering
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:48.720]   into hatred towards the other.
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:50.880]   Maybe if we can just zoom out,
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.720]   what do you, from this particular discussion,
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:59.040]   learn about human nature that we pick the other
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:04.040]   in this kind of way, and we divide each other up in groups,
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:07.400]   and then construct stories,
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.520]   and like constructing those stories,
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:13.680]   and they become really viral and sexy to us,
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:16.360]   and then we channel the hatred.
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.020]   We use those stories to channel our hatred
[02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:18.960]   towards the other.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:23.480]   - Well, yeah, Jews aren't the only recipient of that.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:26.800]   I mean, any time you hear people talking about Jews,
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:29.000]   this or that, white people, this or that,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.480]   black people, this or that, Asians, this or that,
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.800]   where they're an undifferentiated mass,
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:37.160]   who apparently all share something in common,
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.720]   well, then nobody's really thinking.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:43.440]   And the other thing you'll find is that
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.480]   people who will express those views when pressed
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:47.120]   will argue that, oh, well, this, you know,
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:49.180]   if they actually know anybody from those groups,
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.200]   those are okay.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.720]   You know, it's like Nazis.
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.640]   Oh, they go, oh, this isn't okay, Jew.
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:55.680]   They're all right.
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:58.320]   They will always be constantly making exceptions,
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:59.400]   in one form.
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:02.160]   What they actually meant, an actual human being,
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:03.960]   and they seem to be fairly normal,
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:05.480]   well, they were okay.
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:07.000]   So what it was that they hated
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.160]   weren't actual people for the most part.
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.200]   It was just this kind of gollywog vision
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:15.200]   that they had of them.
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:17.300]   You're not even talking about real people.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:20.800]   I don't know.
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:22.500]   What does that tell you about human nature?
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:26.160]   Well, okay, in 70-odd years,
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.700]   what have I learned about my fellow creatures?
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:34.820]   One, I don't actually understand them any better
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:35.660]   than I ever did.
[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:37.600]   In fact, less so, okay.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.600]   I would say this.
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:40.760]   When I was 17, I thought that I had the world
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:42.960]   much more figured out than I do now.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:46.240]   Completely deluded, but you know,
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.600]   it seemed to make much more sense
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.160]   than I could categorize things.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:51.840]   Basic take upon human beings,
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:56.600]   most people, most of the time are polite,
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.600]   cooperative, and kind until they're not.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:09.200]   And the exact tipping point and moment
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:13.500]   in which they go from one to the other is unpredictable.
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:16.720]   God, that's brilliantly put.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:18.660]   Speaking of the tipping point,
[02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:22.060]   you gave a series of lectures on murderers,
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:23.900]   crimes in the 20th century.
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:26.620]   One of the crimes that you described
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:29.220]   is the Manson family murders.
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:31.180]   And that combines a lot of the elements
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:32.500]   of what we've been talking about
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:34.980]   and a lot of the elements of the human nature
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:37.020]   that you just described.
[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:39.660]   So can you just tell the story at a high level
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:41.060]   as you understand it?
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:41.900]   The Manson family.
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:43.180]   Well, you begin with Charles Manson,
[02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:44.380]   who's the key element in this.
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:47.380]   And Charles Manson, for most of his life,
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:50.620]   up until the time that he's around 33,
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:52.900]   is an unexceptional petty criminal.
[02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:55.460]   In and out of prison,
[02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:58.740]   reform school from an early age,
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:01.520]   not really associated with violent crimes.
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:06.520]   He did stuff like steal cars, write bad checks,
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:09.180]   became an unsuccessful pimp and drug dealer.
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:13.600]   So around 1967, he gets out of his latest stint
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:16.460]   in federal lockup in Terminal Island,
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:18.380]   near Los Angeles, California.
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:22.500]   By that time, he's learned how to play the guitar,
[02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:25.100]   has ambitions to become a musician,
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:29.480]   and also has proclaimed himself a Scientologist.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:31.780]   Not that he ever seems to have practiced,
[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:34.340]   but that's what he would claim that he was.
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:38.380]   Kind of self-educated himself in prison to a certain degree.
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:42.620]   And so when he gets out of prison in '67,
[02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:45.820]   he was a model prisoner.
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:49.940]   He behaved himself and seemed,
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:51.380]   you can sort of imagine his life
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.500]   as going in a completely different direction.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:57.260]   And here again, I'm gonna say something
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:58.980]   kind of good about Charles Manson,
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:02.100]   which is that he actually was a decent singer.
[02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:05.220]   If you really sort of listen to some of the stuff he did,
[02:29:05.220 --> 02:29:09.980]   he's not a great singer, but he could have,
[02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:12.200]   other people got recording contracts
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:13.620]   with less talent than he had,
[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:15.220]   and he could play guitar.
[02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:18.180]   The Beach Boys actually do record
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:20.460]   one of his songs without him.
[02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:23.060]   - How would you evaluate Hitler's painting
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.740]   on compared to Charles Manson's?
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:26.500]   - Well, you're supposed to say it's terrible.
[02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:27.580]   - Okay. - Okay.
[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:28.740]   It looks average to me.
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:29.700]   - Yeah, it's landscape.
[02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:32.340]   - I mean, if you didn't know it was Hitler,
[02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:35.780]   would it, would it, would it, would you,
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:38.740]   I don't know what people will say about it.
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:39.580]   - I'm sorry for the distraction.
[02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:42.580]   - It's just, you know, it's just, it's an average painter.
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:43.500]   That's what it was.
[02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:46.580]   It's nothing like crazy genocidal maniac paintings.
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:48.500]   You don't have really have those.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:50.660]   So Manson, he could have done that.
[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:52.460]   He probably could have, you know,
[02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:55.460]   he made certain inroads into the music industry,
[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:56.860]   and if he hadn't been such a weirdo,
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:59.220]   he might've gotten further with it,
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:01.460]   but his life could have taken a different turn.
[02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:02.940]   So this is one of the questions I have.
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:05.020]   Where did a guy who becomes,
[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:07.740]   who's an unexceptional career petty criminal,
[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:12.060]   suddenly emerge into some sort of criminal mastermind,
[02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:15.980]   a Svengali, who can bend all of these people to his will
[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:18.020]   and get them to go out and commit murder?
[02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:21.780]   That's a, that's a real shift that you have.
[02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:25.740]   So the first thing it kind of could tell you
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.220]   that something odd is going on,
[02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:30.800]   is he gets out of prison in L.A. County,
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:36.140]   and he's supposed to, you know, he's on parole.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:38.420]   You know, parolees are supposed to have a job,
[02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:40.980]   not supposed to leave the jurisdiction of their parole.
[02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:42.660]   He heads straight for the Bay Area,
[02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:44.480]   violates parole right off the bat.
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:49.580]   Two weeks later, he drifts into the parole office
[02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:52.660]   in the Bay Area, whereupon he should have been arrested
[02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:55.020]   and sent back to Terminal Island,
[02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:56.820]   but instead they just assign him a parole.
[02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:59.100]   I don't know, maybe things were easier then in some way.
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.960]   So he gets assigned a parole officer, Michael Smith.
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:06.660]   Michael Smith is initially handling a number of parolees,
[02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:08.660]   but after a while, once he takes on Manson,
[02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:11.700]   he only has one parolee he's supervising,
[02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:14.540]   Charlie Manson, which is odd.
[02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:17.460]   Then you also find out that Michael Smith,
[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:19.500]   in addition to being a parole officer,
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:23.280]   is a graduate student at the University of California,
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.980]   studying group dynamics,
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:30.980]   especially the influence of drugs on gangs and groups.
[02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:34.300]   And he's also connected to the Hayat Ashbery Free Clinic,
[02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:37.020]   which is a place where the influence of,
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:40.460]   'cause Hayat Ashbery had lots of drugs and lots of groups.
[02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:45.880]   So, you know, Charlie Manson never gets a regular job,
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:50.460]   hangs around with young girls,
[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:56.180]   ex-cons, engages in criminal activity,
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:58.580]   is repeatedly arrested, but nothing ever sticks
[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:02.240]   for the, you know, next couple of years.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:06.020]   So who gets that type of thing?
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:08.440]   Who gets a get-out-of-jail-free card?
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:11.260]   Informants.
[02:32:11.260 --> 02:32:17.580]   So here is what, again, this is speculation,
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:23.700]   but Manson, at some point after he got out of prison,
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:26.260]   is getting this treatment because he is recruited
[02:32:26.260 --> 02:32:28.140]   as a confidential informant.
[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:29.460]   - For who?
[02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:30.300]   - For who?
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:33.860]   That's the interesting question.
[02:32:35.060 --> 02:32:39.140]   So, probably not for any local police departments.
[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:41.180]   My best suspicion is probably
[02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:43.540]   the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,
[02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:45.540]   precursor to the DEA.
[02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:52.380]   You know, federal parolee, federal parole officer,
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:55.460]   cum graduate student in drugs and group dynamics,
[02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:59.500]   and eventually, with permission, he goes back down to LA.
[02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:01.460]   And what is he part of when he's there?
[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:03.860]   Well, he's on the fringes of the music industry.
[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:05.660]   Not so much, you know,
[02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:09.180]   these, those are the Wilsons and elsewhere,
[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:11.780]   which also brings him to the fringes of the film industry.
[02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:13.660]   So one of the things, if you're sort of looking
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:17.420]   in terms of Hollywood music industry elites
[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:20.280]   in the flow of, oh, and he's also dealing in drugs,
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:22.020]   and girls.
[02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:26.300]   So an early version of Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:29.660]   - Yeah.
[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:33.020]   - Manson attracted lots of underage runaways,
[02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:37.660]   and trained them, used them,
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.980]   also associating with biker gangs
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:41.900]   who produced the drugs, et cetera.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:43.660]   So that's part of what he's,
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:46.980]   he's an informant in the movement of drugs,
[02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:49.820]   basically within the film music industries.
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.780]   And he's given pretty much a kind of free reign
[02:33:51.780 --> 02:33:52.620]   at that point.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:56.900]   What then happens in August of 1969
[02:33:56.900 --> 02:33:59.020]   is that there are these murders, you know,
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:02.900]   first Sharon Tate and her friends in Cielo Drive.
[02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:06.620]   I think everybody has probably pretty much heard
[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:07.780]   that story before.
[02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:10.980]   And of course the question is, why Cielo Drive?
[02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:13.260]   Why Sharon Tate, Frikoski, and the rest of them
[02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:14.100]   that he has them?
[02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:15.740]   Manson was familiar with the place.
[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:17.100]   He had been there before.
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:19.640]   Members of the family had been there before.
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:22.220]   So he knew where it was.
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:24.860]   It wasn't an easy place to find.
[02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:26.220]   I mean, the way that that house,
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:28.460]   the house, the original house is no longer there,
[02:34:28.460 --> 02:34:31.300]   but the same sort of property in a house is built there.
[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:33.900]   And if you didn't know where it was,
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:35.300]   it's not some place,
[02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:37.300]   let's just go for a drive in the Hollywood Hills
[02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:38.940]   and murder people in a house.
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:41.500]   Well, that isn't the one that you would come across.
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:44.460]   There are lots of connections there.
[02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:46.940]   Wojtek Frikoski, who was one of the people killed
[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:50.100]   at the Cielo Drive house was involved in drug dealing.
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:52.260]   That's a possible connection between the two.
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:54.660]   Probably a fairly likely one.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:58.700]   Probably not unfortunate Sharon Tate at all.
[02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:02.700]   She was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:04.920]   Her husband might've been, you never know.
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:11.140]   And then the next night after the slaughter there,
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:13.060]   which by the way, Manson is not at.
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:14.740]   So this is one of the interesting things about is
[02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:17.340]   Charles Manson doesn't kill any of these people.
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:21.120]   His crime is supposedly ordering the killings to be done.
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:28.260]   He supposedly thought that the killings
[02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:29.760]   at the Tate house were sloppy.
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:32.980]   And he was gonna give everybody a crash course
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:35.820]   in how you apparently commit seemingly random murders.
[02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:37.660]   So the next night he takes a group of people
[02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:41.140]   over to the LaBianca's house in a different section of LA.
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:45.460]   And you've got Lena and Rosemary, LaBianca,
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:47.300]   guy's a grocer.
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:50.980]   His wife runs a dress shop, upper middle class.
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:54.860]   And they're bound to gagged and hacked to death.
[02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:58.380]   And as at the Tate residence,
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:00.620]   various things like piggy are written,
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:02.060]   various messages in blood,
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:04.560]   things that are supposed to look like cat's paws,
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.400]   because one of the groups trying to be framed for this
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.200]   was the idea was the Black Panthers.
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:14.200]   So the general story that comes out in the subsequent trial
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:15.640]   is that this was all a part of something
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:17.240]   called Helter Skelter,
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:19.820]   which Manson supposedly was an idea
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:21.560]   that that sounds like a Beatles song.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.200]   That's where he got it from.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:24.840]   He thought the Beatles were talking to him
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:26.160]   through their music
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:30.160]   and that there was going to be an apocalyptic race war.
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.360]   And this was all part of a plan to set this off.
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:37.000]   So this is why the Black Panthers
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.040]   were trying to be implicated in this.
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:43.460]   Although how it was supposed to do that
[02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:44.900]   is never really explained.
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:50.560]   Here is what I think was really happening.
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:53.260]   What really happened and how I think it fits together.
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:56.760]   Before Sharon Tate and her friends
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:58.460]   or the LaBiancas were killed,
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:02.880]   there was a murder by members of the family
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.700]   of some of the same people involved in the later killings
[02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:08.440]   of a musician drug manufacturer
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.800]   by the name of Gary Hinman.
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:14.240]   So Manson again was involved in the drug trade
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.640]   and Hinman made them.
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:19.380]   He was a cook basically.
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:22.800]   And he brewed them up in his basement,
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:26.620]   sold the drugs to Manson who sold them to biker gangs
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:28.520]   like the Straight Satans,
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:30.120]   which was one of the groups that he used
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:31.920]   and they distributed them elsewhere.
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:35.960]   Well, one day the Straight Satans show up
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:39.320]   and complain that the last batch of meth
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.560]   or whatever it was that they got from Manson
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:46.200]   had made some of their brothers very, very ill.
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:48.880]   And they were quite unhappy about that.
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:50.980]   And they wanted their $2,000 back.
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:55.900]   Manson had gotten those drugs from Gary Hinman.
[02:37:55.900 --> 02:38:01.120]   So he is unhappy and he sends Bobby Bose away
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:03.720]   and a couple of the girls over to Hinman's place
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:05.120]   to get the money from him.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:09.960]   As the story is later related, I think by Susan Atkins,
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.280]   Hinman denied that there was anything wrong with his drugs
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.880]   and refused to pay up,
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.220]   which led to a interrogation torture session
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:20.480]   in which he was killed.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.480]   And the idea was here, what are we gonna do with that?
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:25.640]   Well, one of the other groups
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:29.140]   that Hinman had sold drugs to were, guess what?
[02:38:29.140 --> 02:38:30.960]   People associated with the Black Panthers.
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:32.840]   So we'll leave these things up
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:35.600]   and we'll make them, they will do it.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:40.600]   So it's Bobby Bose away who then takes Hinman's car
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.880]   and decides to drive it up the coast.
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:47.520]   By the way, with a bloody knife
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:50.560]   with Hinman's blood and hair on it
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.480]   and blood on the seats in the car.
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:53.880]   And then he pulls it off the road
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:57.000]   and decides to sleep it off and he gets busted, right?
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.160]   So find Hinman's body,
[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:04.040]   find Bose and Hinman's car with a bloody knife with him.
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:05.280]   Yeah, he gets arrested.
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:11.120]   So Bose was very popular with some of the girls.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:14.400]   There's consternation in the family
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:16.220]   that Bobby has been arrested.
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:19.300]   So how can we possibly get Bobby out of jail?
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:21.460]   Copycat killings.
[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:25.160]   So if we go kill more people and we make it look the same,
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.600]   then see, Bobby couldn't possibly have done it.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:30.080]   No, see, he just borrowed the car.
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.400]   I mean, okay, he stole the car,
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.240]   but the knife was already in it.
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:34.840]   He didn't have anything to do with this.
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:39.480]   So that, to me, makes the most sense out of what followed.
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:41.520]   - How often do people talk about that theory?
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:43.280]   That's an interesting theory.
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.440]   - Well, it's there.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:46.320]   It's just not the one that,
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.240]   but we also wanted to go with "Helter Skelter"
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:49.800]   because it was, again,
[02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:52.120]   it was a story that people could understand.
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:56.300]   And it was sensational and it would catch on.
[02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:59.080]   Also another probable issue in that
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:02.880]   was that his star witness was Linda Kasabian.
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:05.800]   Linda Kasabian, she was present
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:08.920]   at both the Tate and LaBianca murders.
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:11.820]   She didn't participate in the killings, according to her.
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:14.080]   She sort of drives the car,
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.520]   but everybody else talked about what had happened.
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.760]   Well, okay, she turns state's evidence
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:22.160]   and gets total immunity.
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:25.640]   And it's largely in her testimony
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:27.900]   that all the rest of the case is based.
[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:31.880]   Now, if you start throwing into the equation
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.320]   that she proclaimed her love for Bobby Beausoleil
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:38.020]   and that she, according to others,
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:41.160]   was the chief proponent of the copycat killings.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:44.560]   Well, then that would get messy.
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:46.800]   Now, there's one guy that's at the center of this.
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:49.040]   It's Charles Manson.
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:53.800]   He ordered all of this done to ignite a race war,
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.800]   even though, how would any of that do it?
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:00.320]   - So that doesn't make sense,
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:02.680]   but he is nevertheless at the center of this
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:05.000]   because he's the glue of the family, right?
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.360]   - He exerts a tremendous amount
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:08.480]   of psychological control over them.
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:11.320]   - How was he able to do that, Sergeant Charles?
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:13.080]   'Cause you said he was a petty criminal.
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.180]   It does seem he was pretty prolific in his petty crimes.
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:17.760]   Like he did a lot of them.
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:19.800]   - He had a lot of access to LSD.
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:22.060]   - Okay.
[02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:25.920]   - Okay, which he started getting at the free clinic
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:29.200]   in San Francisco.
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.440]   So lots of it floating around.
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:34.840]   Some descriptions of the family at Spahn Ranch
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:38.640]   is that people were basically taking acid on a daily basis,
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:40.760]   which, by the way, was also a potential problem
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:42.760]   with Linda Kasabian's testimony,
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:45.560]   since she also admitted to being high most of the time
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:47.680]   and also thinking she was a witch.
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:49.920]   All right, so you wanna put her, okay.
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:51.320]   Where do you wanna go with that?
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:54.560]   See, if Manson wasn't Manson,
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.840]   if he hadn't acted like such a complete,
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.600]   if he hadn't actually acted like
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:01.720]   the crazed hippie psycho goofball
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:03.780]   that Bugliosi painted him as being,
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:09.720]   then Kasabian's testimony wouldn't have been as strong
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:11.720]   because you could, I mean, the first thing against her
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:13.040]   is you've got an immunity
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:17.120]   for telling the story the prosecution wants.
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:20.080]   That's a little iffy.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:22.240]   And we won't even bring in the witch and the drugs
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:24.480]   and being in love with Bobby Bosley, all right.
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:27.320]   So if Manson had been dressed like you,
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:29.200]   sitting there in a suit and tie,
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:32.640]   and had behaved himself and spoken normally,
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:34.040]   things might've, this isn't to say
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:36.580]   that he wasn't guilty as hell.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:41.400]   So what he supposedly did was to inspire
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.920]   all of these killings.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:50.480]   And I think that's probably,
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:52.780]   sort of beginning with the Hinman killing.
[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:56.120]   He told them to go over there and get the money,
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:42:57.520]   one way or the other.
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:59.040]   I don't know whether it's clear whether he told them
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:02.340]   if you don't get the money, kill him, but Hinman's dead.
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:08.400]   And then you might also have seen the value
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.600]   in terms of having copycat killings
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:15.080]   as a way of throwing off any other kind of blame.
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:16.840]   The other story you get is that one of the people
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:19.400]   who had lived at the Cielo house where Sharon Tate was
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:23.620]   before was a record producer by the name of Terry Melcher.
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:28.020]   Melcher supposedly, as the general story goes,
[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:32.160]   had welched on a deal with Manson
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:34.400]   in terms of a record contract.
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:37.280]   He screwed over Manson in some sort of a record deal
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:39.760]   and Manson wanted to get revenge
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:42.420]   and sent them to kill everybody in the house.
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:45.640]   Which again, doesn't make it much of a sense.
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:48.540]   One, Manson knew that Melcher wasn't living there anymore.
[02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:51.840]   He probably knew where Melcher was living.
[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:54.560]   If he wanted to get Melcher, he could have found him.
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:56.120]   It wasn't that difficult to do.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.920]   And
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:06.960]   so that's, it's not revenge on Terry Melcher
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:08.720]   that drew him there.
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:11.280]   He was familiar with the house,
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:15.080]   so if the idea was to simply commit random killings
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:16.620]   that would throw,
[02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:20.420]   that would muddy the whole waters with the Hinman killing,
[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:22.640]   then you might pick some place you knew of,
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:23.960]   you knew the place was running out,
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:26.680]   there would be someone there and you really didn't care.
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:29.760]   In the same way that the La Bianca seemed to have been.
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000]   Manson was familiar with that
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.840]   because it supposedly had been the scene of creepy crawling.
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:39.960]   This is little interesting things
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:42.200]   that the family would be taught to do.
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:44.080]   Creepy crawling is when you sneak
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:45.640]   into somebody's house at night,
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:50.200]   while they're there asleep or when they're not there
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:52.080]   and you move things around.
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:55.200]   So when they get up in the morning or they come home,
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.880]   they'll suddenly notice that someone has been in their house
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:00.540]   which will freak them out,
[02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:02.920]   which is the whole point of that.
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:04.280]   - But it doesn't seem like the murder
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:06.320]   or the creepy crawling was the,
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:07.720]   well, creepy crawling may it be,
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:10.360]   but it doesn't seem like the murder,
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.320]   like some of the other people you've covered
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:13.920]   like the Zodiac Killer,
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:15.300]   the murder is the goal.
[02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:21.440]   Maybe there's some psychopathic kind of artistry
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.560]   to the murder that the Zodiac Killer had
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:25.200]   and the messaging behind that,
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.400]   but it seems like with the,
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:28.600]   at least the way you're describing it
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.400]   with the Charles Manson family,
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:31.680]   the murder was just the,
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:34.920]   they just had a basic disregard for human life
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:37.400]   and the murder was a consequence
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.680]   of just operating in the drug underworld.
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:42.560]   - So Manson set up a kind of base,
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.280]   I think called the Spawn Movie Ranch,
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:46.560]   which was an old movie ranch
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:48.960]   out on the northwest edge of LA.
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:51.560]   And they just kind of camped out there.
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:55.800]   He used the girls, in particular Squeaky Frome,
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:59.400]   to get the owner or operator
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:04.960]   I think George Spawn to let them hang out there.
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.920]   And basically she slept with him
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:09.160]   and he was perfectly happy to let them hang out.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:11.860]   They also had a place out in the desert that they had.
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:15.600]   They dealt in credit card fraud, stolen cars.
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.120]   It was kind of a chop shop that they ran out of the place.
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:25.200]   So he had a fairly good little criminal gig going,
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:29.200]   which with the protection he had probably would have,
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:31.600]   the one thing they couldn't cover him on was murder.
[02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:33.880]   - So you think there was, if he was an informer,
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:34.920]   you think there was still a connection
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:37.920]   between DEA, FBI, CIA, whatever,
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:41.140]   with him throughout this until he'd come into murder?
[02:46:41.140 --> 02:46:43.540]   - The real question is, there is a book written on this
[02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:46.080]   by Tom O'Neill called "Chaos."
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:47.680]   I'm not necessarily saying it's the easiest thing
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:50.120]   to get through, there's a lot of material there.
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:52.360]   I don't think O'Neill necessarily knows what to make
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:53.760]   of some of the stuff he came up with.
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.420]   But he does a very good job of sort of demolishing
[02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:59.240]   the whole Bugliosi narrative.
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:03.400]   And one of the people he mentions is a name
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:05.720]   that I had run into elsewhere.
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.040]   And so I really paid attention to it when I saw it again.
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:10.960]   And the name is Reeve Whitson.
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:17.880]   Reeve Whitson shows up on the fringes
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:20.480]   even though he has no judicial function.
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.560]   He sort of hangs around Bugliosi in the prosecution.
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:25.720]   He's some sort of advice, he's just kind of there.
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.040]   In the same way that he was one of these guys,
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:32.320]   he grew his hair kind of long, wore bell-bottoms,
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:36.760]   hung around the music community and elsewhere in Hollywood,
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:39.560]   but no one could tell you exactly what he did.
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:44.200]   I know what he did later, but a decade later,
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:47.080]   he shows up as a CIA officer in Central America.
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:55.000]   So Reeve Whitson, later in his career at least,
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.120]   is CIA.
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:57.360]   What was he
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:02.600]   in 1969?
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:04.300]   What is he doing in this?
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:08.640]   The other thing about it is he appears to have been
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:10.960]   the person who called, there's a little question
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:15.120]   of when the bodies at Cielo Drive are discovered.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:18.820]   So the general story is that Sharon Tate's housekeeper
[02:48:18.820 --> 02:48:21.280]   shows up around 8.30 in the morning,
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:23.880]   finds the bloody scene and goes screaming next door.
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:27.120]   But there was another fellow who knew,
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.440]   I think the owner of the house, he's a photographer,
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:31.600]   last name may be Hatami.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:33.640]   He gets a call earlier in the morning
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:37.440]   saying that there'd been murders there.
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:43.860]   And the person he recalls calling him is Reeve Whitson.
[02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:49.280]   So someone had been at the house
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:51.240]   before the bodies were discovered
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:53.740]   and they had not called the police.
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:59.460]   So I don't know what's going on there,
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:04.860]   but it's a curious kind of situation.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:10.100]   And Manson, in a lot of ways,
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:13.180]   just kind of self-immolates himself.
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:15.580]   I mean, his behavior at the trial is bizarre,
[02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:18.300]   it's threatening, it's disruptive.
[02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:20.660]   He's got his girls out on the street
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:24.020]   carving Xs in their forehead, carrying knives.
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:29.620]   One of the attorneys, initially his attorney, Ron Hughes,
[02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:32.900]   becomes Van Houten's attorney.
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:34.460]   And he figures out that the three girls
[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:39.460]   supposedly on Charlie's insistence are gonna confess.
[02:49:39.460 --> 02:49:42.300]   And they confess that it was all their idea
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:44.200]   and Charlie had nothing to do with it.
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:49.500]   Hughes doesn't like this because his defense for her
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:52.380]   is that she was under his influence
[02:49:52.380 --> 02:49:56.660]   and therefore not responsible for her own actions.
[02:49:56.660 --> 02:49:58.980]   So he was having psychic control.
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:00.760]   So he refuses to go along with it.
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:01.900]   There's a break in the trial,
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:05.140]   he goes camping up in the mountains with some friends,
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:08.020]   disappears during a rainstorm,
[02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:09.740]   and then some months later,
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:11.460]   his decomposed remains are found.
[02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:16.300]   Now, rumors, always the rumors, okay.
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:19.220]   What would history be without rumors?
[02:50:19.220 --> 02:50:21.260]   Hell, that, ah, see members of the family,
[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:24.100]   they were pissed off at Ron Hughes
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:27.380]   because he messed up Charlie's idea to get him off
[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:28.700]   and so they killed him.
[02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:31.140]   Oh, maybe they did, maybe he drowned.
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.240]   That's absolutely impossible to say.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.020]   You got that kind of story, there's a guy named Juan Flynn,
[02:50:37.020 --> 02:50:40.860]   who was an employee at the spawn ranch, didn't like Manson,
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:43.820]   held Manson responsible for the murder of his boss.
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:46.340]   He would testify that Manson told him
[02:50:46.340 --> 02:50:48.100]   that he had ordered all the killings
[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:51.680]   and that Manson also admitted that he had killed 35 people.
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:55.260]   Maybe he did.
[02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:58.820]   On the other hand, Juan Flynn didn't like him
[02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:00.540]   and he had no, other than his word,
[02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:02.540]   had no real proof of what he was saying.
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:05.700]   So please understand me in this case,
[02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:08.100]   is that unlike some people who argue
[02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:10.500]   that Charles Manson got a raw deal,
[02:51:10.500 --> 02:51:14.900]   I don't think that's the case.
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:18.180]   I think that he influenced tremendous influence
[02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:22.780]   over the people there through drugs,
[02:51:22.780 --> 02:51:30.220]   through, sex was another frequent component in it.
[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:34.140]   He had a real whammy over a lot of these people's minds.
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:37.080]   I'm not sure how, that still kind of puzzles me.
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:41.460]   He was a scrawny guy and he wasn't physically intimidating.
[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:43.340]   I mean, even a lot of women
[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:45.140]   wouldn't be physically intimidated by him,
[02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:48.420]   but he nonetheless had this real psychological power
[02:51:48.420 --> 02:51:50.220]   and there were, and if you look around him,
[02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:54.360]   the male followers he had were fairly big guys.
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:58.820]   So he could get people to do what he wanted.
[02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:04.060]   And again, to me, the simplest explanation for this
[02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:06.260]   is that it began with the Hinman killing
[02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:08.780]   and probably on Manson's instigation,
[02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:10.420]   the others were copycat killings
[02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:13.420]   to throw off what was going on.
[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:17.340]   That would, if I was a cop, that's what I would focus on
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:19.900]   'cause that seems to make the most sense.
[02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:21.940]   - It's still, it's fascinating that he's able to have
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:24.820]   that much psychological control over those people
[02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:27.820]   without having a very clear ideology.
[02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:29.220]   So it's a cult.
[02:52:29.220 --> 02:52:32.260]   - Yes, the great focus on Charlie the leader,
[02:52:32.260 --> 02:52:35.300]   the excessive devotion.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:38.340]   - But there's not like a, maybe,
[02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:39.980]   there's not an ideology behind that.
[02:52:39.980 --> 02:52:42.620]   Like something like Scientology or some kind of religious
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:47.140]   or some kind of, I don't know, utopian ideology,
[02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:48.380]   nothing like this.
[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:50.380]   - No, I think that Manson, again,
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:52.060]   was essentially a criminal.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:54.780]   He had a sociopathic mindset
[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:56.540]   and he hit upon a pretty good deal.
[02:52:56.540 --> 02:52:59.660]   - Yeah, but like, how do people convince anybody
[02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:00.500]   of anything?
[02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:04.300]   With a cult, usually you have either an ideology
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:06.540]   or you have maybe personal religion,
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:08.260]   like you said, sex and drugs.
[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:10.340]   But underneath that, can you really keep people
[02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:11.220]   with sex and drugs?
[02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:14.020]   You have to kind of convince them that you love them
[02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:15.500]   in some deep sense.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.900]   Like there's a, like a commune of love.
[02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:20.500]   - Yeah, you have a lot of people there in the cult.
[02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:23.180]   They don't, they have some sort of what we like to call
[02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:25.420]   dysfunctional families.
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:26.260]   - Yeah.
[02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:29.540]   - A lot of the females in particular seem to have come from,
[02:53:29.540 --> 02:53:31.440]   you know, more or less middle-class families,
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.140]   but those are full of dysfunction.
[02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:38.540]   You know, their parents didn't love them,
[02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:43.100]   they were semi-runaways, and now they had this whole family.
[02:53:43.100 --> 02:53:48.020]   You know, a lot of the younger women had children.
[02:53:48.020 --> 02:53:50.420]   You know, some of them by Manson,
[02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:51.820]   some of them by the others.
[02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:53.860]   They sort of bonded together.
[02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:58.700]   - And again, we return to that pull towards belonging
[02:53:58.700 --> 02:54:01.420]   that gets us humans into trouble.
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:08.560]   So it does seem that there was a few crimes around this time.
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:13.120]   So the Zodiac Killer.
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:18.120]   - Well, California, where I'm from.
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:20.480]   So I remember this period vividly.
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:23.160]   So by the way, the Tate-LaBianca killings
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:25.400]   occurred on my birthday, the year I graduated
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:28.160]   from high school, so I remember this.
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:29.360]   - Happy birthday.
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:31.520]   - A term which has been used for that,
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.680]   there's a writer by the name of Todd Wood
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:35.640]   who's coined, I wish I'd come up with this,
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:40.240]   Killer-fornia, which is just sort of a chronicle
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:43.440]   of the serial killers and disappearances
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:45.040]   in the late '60s and '70s.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.360]   So you've got the Zodiac, you've got other ones.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:50.680]   I mean, you know, I hate to say it,
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:52.000]   I'm not trying to be flippant about it,
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.000]   but I mean, young female hitchhikers were disappearing
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.680]   at an alarming rate in Northern California.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:01.480]   They're bodies that have never been attributed.
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:05.920]   Some think that they're the Zodiac's victims,
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:08.120]   but it was a dangerous time.
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:12.320]   Edmund Kemper, you know, the co-ed killer
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:14.240]   was another one of them.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.760]   There were a lot of creepy psychopaths running around.
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:20.400]   I don't know if it was something in the water
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:25.400]   or what was going on, but it was a menacing in some cases.
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:31.400]   Hitchhiking, especially if you were alone and female,
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.560]   was not something you wanted to do
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:35.960]   in much of the Golden State,
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:38.640]   certainly not up around the Bay Area.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:40.320]   So there were a lot of these strange sort of killings
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:41.200]   that were going on.
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.880]   The Zodiac is, it's one of those things
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:47.400]   where you have these people who have theories about it.
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:49.680]   And if you don't share their theory,
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:52.200]   then, you know, you're part of the problem
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:53.040]   in some form or another.
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:55.520]   So I'm not sure, for instance,
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.880]   that the Zodiac killings were all committed
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:58.360]   by the same person.
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:01.000]   I think there might've been multiple people involved.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:06.640]   And, you know, the first killings are all of couples.
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:08.460]   It's very sort of clear that they,
[02:56:08.460 --> 02:56:10.160]   I remember in my examination of it,
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:12.360]   one of the things I was looking at specific,
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:16.040]   yeah, what else is there to say about the Zodiac killings?
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:17.320]   So what I was gonna look at
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:20.160]   is that there are all of these accusations
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:22.000]   that there is an occult aspect to it.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.800]   There was some sort of ritualistic aspect.
[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:26.960]   So I looked at different things,
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.120]   locations, victims, phases of the moon.
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:32.680]   That's always worth looking at.
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:36.280]   I didn't find much correspondence in any of those.
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:40.560]   In one of the killings, I think the one in Lake Berryessa,
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.880]   he does appear in this kind of weird hooded costume.
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:46.200]   You know, he's got his symbol,
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:51.200]   the sort of compass or aiming rectal, you know, circle.
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:55.320]   With a cross through it, it can mean a variety of things.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:57.080]   He used guns and he used knives,
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:56:59.520]   but he certainly had a thing for couples,
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:01.240]   except in the last of the killings,
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:04.440]   which is of a cab driver in downtown San Francisco,
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:08.520]   who he shoots in full view of witnesses,
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:11.380]   which is completely atypical.
[02:57:11.380 --> 02:57:16.080]   And also when he was stabbing the victims,
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:19.920]   it doesn't seem like he was very good at it.
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:21.800]   - Or if the goal was to kill them,
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:23.900]   he wasn't very good at it 'cause some of them survived.
[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:26.520]   - Yeah, he doesn't, he's not particularly thorough about it.
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:28.360]   He seems to have had much more,
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:30.680]   more of the violence seems to be directed
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:32.400]   at the females than the males.
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:35.720]   - So, I mean, there's a couple of questions to ask here.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:38.360]   First of all, did people see his face?
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.520]   - There is a composite drawing of his face,
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:43.400]   which I think is based upon the Stein killing,
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:47.320]   the cab driver killing, where there were people who saw him
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.800]   or who claimed that they saw him.
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:52.960]   The other ones were all when it was fairly dark.
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:54.320]   - Right.
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:56.760]   - I'm not sure that anyone else got to look at his face.
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:59.120]   The one that occurred in the daylight at Berryessa,
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.640]   he was wearing a mask.
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:05.640]   So there's something in common initially
[02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:08.680]   in the targeting of victims, which doesn't in the last case.
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:11.880]   Then after that, there's just the different cases of where,
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:16.720]   there's a pretty good case to be made of a woman who claims,
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:20.400]   I think she and her small child were picked up,
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.360]   her car broke down, she got a flat tire,
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:24.040]   and she was picked up by this guy
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.320]   who she got a very sort of strange vibe from,
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:28.880]   who eventually just let her go.
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.600]   Well, you know, that might've been the Zodiac.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:35.080]   It might not have been.
[02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:39.080]   - You do this kind of rigorous look saying like,
[02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:41.960]   okay, what is the actual facts that we know?
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:45.560]   Like reduce it to the thing that we know for sure.
[02:58:45.560 --> 02:58:49.500]   And in speaking about his motivation,
[02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:53.920]   he said that he was collecting souls.
[02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:55.480]   - Souls for the afterlife.
[02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:56.680]   - For the afterlife.
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:57.880]   - That's kind of a culty.
[02:58:57.880 --> 02:58:59.960]   - Yeah, I mean, that's what I believe.
[02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:01.880]   Is it the Vikings or the Romans?
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:04.320]   They believed this in battle.
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:07.000]   - You're essentially making sacrificial victims
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:10.560]   and they will be your ghostly servants in the afterlife.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:12.200]   - Do you think he actually believed that?
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:13.040]   - Who knows?
[02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:14.960]   I mean, here's the question.
[02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:19.480]   Was he making that up just to be scary
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:22.240]   or is that what his actual,
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:24.260]   that's what he's saying his motivation is.
[02:59:24.260 --> 02:59:25.800]   So let's take him at face value
[02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:27.840]   rather than trying to
[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:32.880]   wish that into the cornfield,
[02:59:32.880 --> 02:59:34.360]   that is to get rid of it.
[02:59:34.360 --> 02:59:36.400]   Let's just take it at face.
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:38.640]   So he's claiming that he's killing these people
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:42.040]   in order to acquire slave servants in the afterlife.
[02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:46.520]   He will subsequently go on to claim many more victims.
[02:59:46.520 --> 02:59:49.520]   I'm not sure, 44, eventually he will have,
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.120]   before he just kind of vanishes.
[02:59:51.120 --> 02:59:56.200]   One of the really interesting clues to me
[02:59:56.200 --> 02:59:57.560]   when I was looking at that case,
[02:59:57.560 --> 02:59:58.960]   which I didn't find anybody else
[02:59:58.960 --> 03:00:00.360]   that tended to make much of it up,
[03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:04.680]   is that it all has to do with this kind of Halloween card
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:08.120]   that he sends to the press in San Francisco.
[03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:13.080]   And it's talking about sort of rope by gun, by fire,
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:16.600]   and there's this whole sort of wheel,
[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:18.040]   you know, sort of like the Zodiacs.
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:20.680]   But what's this drawn from, where he got this from,
[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:25.480]   is from a Tim Holt Western comic book published in 1951.
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:27.680]   And you see the same thing on the cover.
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:29.520]   It's wheel of fortune,
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:31.960]   but with different forms of grisly death on it.
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:33.720]   And all of the things that he mentioned
[03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:36.220]   are shown on the cover of this.
[03:00:36.220 --> 03:00:41.040]   So whoever put together that card
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:43.080]   saw that comic book.
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:45.040]   Well, that's kind of an interesting clue.
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.040]   So does that mean he's a comic book collector?
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:51.240]   When would he have, I mean, that is one,
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:54.080]   and also before he got the idea from.
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:56.680]   So he's incorporating these things for me.
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:00:58.480]   Then there are, of course, his codes,
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:00:59.840]   which people have, you know,
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:02.560]   which aren't all that difficult to decipher,
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.660]   probably 'cause they weren't meant to be.
[03:01:04.660 --> 03:01:07.560]   The other thing that you find often
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:10.320]   with serial or psychopathic killers
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:11.680]   is they're toying with the press.
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:14.880]   I mean, this goes all the way back to Jack the Ripper.
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:16.960]   You know, they get attention.
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:20.360]   And then he just disappears.
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:22.440]   - Why do you think he was never caught?
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:24.240]   - I think they knew who to look for.
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:25.840]   There was nothing much to go on.
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:29.600]   I mean, there was a guy who was long a suspect,
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:32.600]   and then eventually he tested his DNA
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:35.600]   and found that it didn't match any of the things
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:37.680]   that they'd found.
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:39.840]   Again, it goes back to,
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:41.520]   I'm not even sure that it's one person
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:43.680]   who's responsible for all of them.
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:45.320]   - Well, so one of the interesting things
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:47.080]   you kind of bring up here,
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.640]   and our discussion of Manson inspires this,
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:56.240]   but there does seem to be a connection,
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:00.260]   a shared inspiration between several killers here,
[03:02:00.260 --> 03:02:03.040]   the Zodiac, the son of Sam later,
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:05.600]   and the monster of Florence.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:08.200]   So is it possible there's some kind of,
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:11.840]   like an underworld that is connecting these people?
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:14.160]   - Well, you take the Zodiac,
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:16.040]   and you had his claim
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.120]   that he's collecting souls for the afterlife.
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:18.960]   There are other things
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:23.240]   that are occult-ish connected to that.
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:26.240]   He may have picked some of the killing sites
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:29.520]   due to their physical location,
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:32.440]   to their position in a particular place.
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.040]   If you look at the son of Sam case,
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:38.540]   of course, David Berkowitz will on and off claim
[03:02:38.540 --> 03:02:41.200]   that he was part of a satanic cult
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:43.920]   that was carrying out, again, these killings,
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:51.080]   mostly of couples and young women similar to the Zodiac,
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:54.360]   and that he had only committed some of them
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:55.820]   and was witnesses at others.
[03:02:55.820 --> 03:02:59.800]   And that has really created the whole idea
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:04.280]   that yes, there is this some kind of satanic cult
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.600]   which engages in ritual murders.
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:09.240]   Then if you go all the way to Florence,
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:11.280]   you've got murders who go on and off
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:12.480]   for a long period of time,
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:17.120]   again, focusing on couples in isolated areas,
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:20.480]   which Italian prosecutors ultimately tried to connect
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:23.180]   to some kind of satanic cult,
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:24.740]   although I'm not sure they ever made
[03:03:24.740 --> 03:03:26.480]   a particularly strong case for that.
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:28.840]   But that element comes up in all three of them.
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:35.760]   So you can, with a little imagination,
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:38.080]   argue that those similarities,
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:41.480]   that those things should come up in each of those cases
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:43.260]   in different places.
[03:03:43.260 --> 03:03:47.600]   Either suggest that, oddly enough,
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:50.480]   psychopathic criminals all sort of thinking the same way,
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:54.480]   or that there is some sort of higher element
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:56.200]   involved in this,
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:58.440]   that there's some kind of common inspiration.
[03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:03.260]   And here again, you come back to something
[03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:05.760]   similar we were talking before about do pedophiles exist,
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:10.760]   do pedophiles, okay, so do satanic cults exist?
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:11.680]   Well, they do.
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:14.440]   Okay, there was one in my hometown.
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:18.560]   Apparently quite harmless, as far as I know,
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.760]   never did anything, but there are people who,
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:23.080]   you know, robes, here we come again,
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:25.000]   robes, cut the head off a chicken,
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:26.800]   naked woman is an altar, you know,
[03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:29.860]   you can get off on that, I suppose, if that's your thing.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:35.860]   So, profess satanists exist, satanic cults exist,
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:40.580]   serial killers exist, ritual murders exist,
[03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:43.620]   are those things necessarily connected?
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:44.520]   No.
[03:04:44.520 --> 03:04:46.580]   Could they be connected?
[03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:47.420]   Yes.
[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:51.380]   Okay, there's nothing, don't ever tell me
[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:54.140]   that something is just too crazy for people to do,
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:58.060]   'cause that's crazy talk, all right.
[03:04:58.060 --> 03:04:59.980]   You've studied secret societies,
[03:04:59.980 --> 03:05:02.860]   you gave a lot of amazing lectures on secret societies.
[03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:06.580]   It's fascinating to look at human history
[03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:08.580]   through the lens of secret societies,
[03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:11.220]   'cause they've permeated all of human history.
[03:05:11.220 --> 03:05:13.660]   You've talked about everything from the Knights Templar
[03:05:13.660 --> 03:05:16.420]   to Illuminati to Freemasons, like we brought up,
[03:05:16.420 --> 03:05:18.300]   Freemasons lasted a long time,
[03:05:18.300 --> 03:05:21.020]   Illuminati, as you've talked about,
[03:05:21.020 --> 03:05:24.460]   in its sort of main form, lasted a short time,
[03:05:24.460 --> 03:05:26.280]   but its legend--
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:27.120]   - Never gone away.
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:28.320]   - Never gone away.
[03:05:28.320 --> 03:05:30.900]   So maybe, like, Illuminati is a really interesting one.
[03:05:30.900 --> 03:05:33.380]   Who, what was that?
[03:05:33.380 --> 03:05:35.620]   - Well, the Illuminati that we know
[03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:41.600]   started in 1776, in fact, you can pin it down to a day,
[03:05:41.600 --> 03:05:45.780]   the first of May, May Day, 1776,
[03:05:45.780 --> 03:05:47.980]   in Ingolstadt, Germany,
[03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:51.340]   founded by a professor, Adam Weishaupt.
[03:05:51.340 --> 03:05:54.480]   It wasn't initially called the Illuminati,
[03:05:54.480 --> 03:05:57.020]   'cause that's not really the name of the organization,
[03:05:57.020 --> 03:05:59.660]   it was called the Order of Perfectibilists.
[03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:01.740]   Apparently that changed.
[03:06:01.740 --> 03:06:03.340]   Weishaupt would say things like,
[03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:05.660]   "Never let our organization be known
[03:06:05.660 --> 03:06:08.060]   "under its real name anywhere,"
[03:06:08.060 --> 03:06:10.260]   which leaves wondering what's its real name.
[03:06:10.260 --> 03:06:15.780]   So Illuminati is simply the plural of Illuminatis,
[03:06:15.780 --> 03:06:17.540]   which means one who is illuminated,
[03:06:17.540 --> 03:06:19.160]   one who has seen the light.
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:22.100]   So in Roman times,
[03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:25.940]   Christian converts were Illuminati,
[03:06:25.940 --> 03:06:27.340]   because they had seen the light.
[03:06:27.340 --> 03:06:28.620]   Anyone who thinks,
[03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:32.420]   and there have been organizations called Illuminati,
[03:06:32.420 --> 03:06:37.420]   the term is not trademarked, not copyrighted.
[03:06:37.420 --> 03:06:38.980]   Anybody who thinks they've seen the light
[03:06:38.980 --> 03:06:40.820]   about anything is an Illuminati.
[03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:42.600]   So it defines nothing.
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:46.820]   The symbol of the Order was an owl,
[03:06:46.820 --> 03:06:50.940]   which, interestingly enough, is almost identical
[03:06:50.940 --> 03:06:55.700]   to the owl, which is the emblem of the Bohemian Club.
[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:56.540]   - Oh, boy.
[03:06:56.540 --> 03:06:58.020]   - Make of that what you will.
[03:06:58.020 --> 03:07:00.540]   I don't make that much out of it,
[03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:03.820]   because one owl looks pretty much like another owl to me,
[03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:05.460]   but compare them,
[03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:08.660]   you gotta kind of wonder about this,
[03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:10.380]   a little, just a little thing.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:12.540]   Maybe there's some kind of connection there.
[03:07:12.540 --> 03:07:15.500]   So, but that supposedly has to do with the connection
[03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:18.780]   to the goddess Minerva, and the owl was sacred to her,
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:22.660]   and the Order was the Minerval,
[03:07:22.660 --> 03:07:24.840]   the person who was brought in.
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:28.840]   The number of levels changed over time,
[03:07:28.840 --> 03:07:30.480]   there was a higher level for the Order
[03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:33.340]   that people at the lower level didn't know about,
[03:07:33.340 --> 03:07:34.860]   pretty typical for this.
[03:07:34.860 --> 03:07:39.160]   But the thing about Weishaupt was that he was quite,
[03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:43.560]   he was a luminous correspondent with members
[03:07:43.560 --> 03:07:46.480]   with his Illuminati, both during the time
[03:07:46.480 --> 03:07:49.240]   that it legally existed in Bavaria, and later on.
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:53.680]   So Weishaupt himself lives, I think, until 1830,
[03:07:54.680 --> 03:07:59.360]   dies in Gotha, which was ruled by an Illuminati prince,
[03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:01.880]   and so, nothing ever happens to these,
[03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:03.480]   no Illuminati's ever put to death,
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:05.980]   or arrested, imprisoned for any period of time.
[03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:11.120]   What happens is that their plan, well, what was his plan?
[03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:15.120]   His plan was to essentially replace all existing religions
[03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:19.200]   and governments in the world with a One World Order,
[03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:21.900]   governed by the Illuminati.
[03:08:22.900 --> 03:08:25.380]   So to do this, you had to subvert
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:28.700]   and destroy all the existing order.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:32.900]   And the purpose for this is to,
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:34.980]   "We wish to make men happy and free,
[03:08:34.980 --> 03:08:36.960]   "but first we must make them good."
[03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:39.060]   - Oh, right.
[03:08:39.060 --> 03:08:42.940]   - So that's what the Order is all about.
[03:08:42.940 --> 03:08:44.780]   Of course, he also said things like,
[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:47.420]   "Oh man, is there nothing that you won't believe?"
[03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:49.540]   Okay, so myth would be used in that.
[03:08:49.540 --> 03:08:52.640]   Also thought women should be brought into it.
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:54.300]   He had a rather interesting view about that,
[03:08:54.300 --> 03:08:56.060]   was that we should appeal to women,
[03:08:56.060 --> 03:08:59.580]   in part because women have a chip on their shoulder,
[03:08:59.580 --> 03:09:01.180]   'cause they're left out of things.
[03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:04.740]   So we should appeal to their vanity on that point,
[03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:06.400]   and offer that in the future,
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:10.060]   all things will be open and they will be emancipated.
[03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:13.060]   So we should hold out the prospect of female emancipation
[03:09:13.060 --> 03:09:16.300]   to attract them, because he argued in the short term,
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:18.780]   there's no better way to influence men
[03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:20.140]   than through women.
[03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:23.020]   Get women on our side by promising them emancipation,
[03:09:23.020 --> 03:09:26.700]   but he made sure we'll never actually deliver it to them,
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:29.060]   because the future world will be a boys' club.
[03:09:29.060 --> 03:09:34.060]   So he talks about these things fairly openly,
[03:09:34.060 --> 03:09:35.540]   and this is where you get this idea
[03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:37.580]   of some sort of a new world order,
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:39.940]   which is to be based upon the destruction
[03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:41.600]   of the existing order.
[03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:44.860]   So there are those who argue
[03:09:46.260 --> 03:09:48.620]   that there is a trail of dissent
[03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:52.140]   that leads from Weishaupt's Illuminati
[03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:54.700]   to the Communist Manifesto,
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:09:57.300]   and in fact, communism itself,
[03:09:57.300 --> 03:10:02.940]   that Marxism was simply a further restating of this idea.
[03:10:02.940 --> 03:10:05.980]   And you can draw some sort of connection,
[03:10:05.980 --> 03:10:08.520]   I mean, the idea never entirely goes away.
[03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:13.420]   The Bavarian government gets a hold
[03:10:13.420 --> 03:10:16.060]   of the order's inner texts.
[03:10:16.060 --> 03:10:18.340]   So the story is they're delivered to them.
[03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:20.720]   I think that Weishaupt gave them to him.
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:24.220]   I think he engineered the exposure of his order
[03:10:24.220 --> 03:10:26.880]   because it gave him publicity.
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.820]   By being exposed in Bavaria, you gained great renown,
[03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:33.580]   and they continued to recruit after this,
[03:10:33.580 --> 03:10:36.860]   and the Bavarian government actually bans the Illuminati
[03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:38.000]   four different times.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.620]   Why?
[03:10:41.620 --> 03:10:44.420]   'Cause apparently the first three times didn't work,
[03:10:44.420 --> 03:10:45.740]   so the fourth one does.
[03:10:45.740 --> 03:10:49.260]   You can notice that it's like Papel bans on Freemasonry,
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:50.740]   and they just go on and on and on,
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:52.500]   'cause this clearly isn't working.
[03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:55.620]   - And you actually highlight the difference between,
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:56.900]   speaking of publicity,
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:10:58.620]   that there's a difference between
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:00.700]   visibility and transparency,
[03:11:00.700 --> 03:11:02.660]   that a secret society could be visible,
[03:11:02.660 --> 03:11:06.240]   it could be known about, it could be quite popular,
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:08.400]   but you could still have a secrecy within it.
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:10.460]   - You have no idea what's going on inside.
[03:11:10.460 --> 03:11:11.780]   It's like a black box.
[03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:13.220]   If I set a black box on this table,
[03:11:13.220 --> 03:11:14.860]   we can see that there is a black box.
[03:11:14.860 --> 03:11:16.260]   What's in the black box?
[03:11:16.260 --> 03:11:17.420]   A cat?
[03:11:17.420 --> 03:11:18.260]   Who knows?
[03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:20.020]   - In fact, the secrecy might be the very thing
[03:11:20.020 --> 03:11:21.620]   that makes it even more popular.
[03:11:21.620 --> 03:11:24.940]   - Adam Weishaupt, again, there's no more thing convincing
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:26.340]   than a concealed mystery.
[03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:28.260]   Give people a concealed mystery in their thoughts.
[03:11:28.260 --> 03:11:30.420]   So we need to make the order mysterious
[03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:32.000]   for that exact reason.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:36.540]   Always hold out the possibility that knowledge,
[03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:38.980]   special knowledge that no mere mortals have
[03:11:38.980 --> 03:11:41.860]   other than you, we'll have it that way.
[03:11:41.860 --> 03:11:43.740]   So he senses a lot of things.
[03:11:43.740 --> 03:11:48.300]   The use of vanity and ego to recruit people
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:51.900]   to influence both men and women,
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:54.620]   it's quite sophisticated.
[03:11:54.620 --> 03:12:00.140]   And as you might expect from a professor of canon law
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:01.600]   trained by Jesuits.
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:04.020]   So,
[03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:10.300]   I certainly don't think that it ceased
[03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:13.920]   when it was banned in Bavaria.
[03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:15.900]   'Cause everybody just scatters and goes elsewhere.
[03:12:15.900 --> 03:12:16.940]   Like Paris.
[03:12:16.940 --> 03:12:21.300]   And then you have the French Revolution.
[03:12:21.300 --> 03:12:23.380]   - So the idea of the Illuminati,
[03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:26.860]   to put it crudely, the branding,
[03:12:26.860 --> 03:12:28.160]   is a really powerful one.
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:31.160]   And so it makes sense that it can,
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:34.900]   there's a thread connecting it to this day.
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:37.420]   That a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies
[03:12:37.420 --> 03:12:39.780]   can sort of adopt the branding.
[03:12:39.780 --> 03:12:40.620]   - Anybody can call it.
[03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:43.060]   You can go out and form a club and call it the Illuminati.
[03:12:43.060 --> 03:12:44.380]   - And if you're effective at it,
[03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:46.020]   I think it does attract,
[03:12:46.020 --> 03:12:49.380]   honey, it's the chicken or the egg.
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:52.380]   But powerful people tend to have gigantic egos
[03:12:52.380 --> 03:12:54.620]   and people with gigantic egos tend to like
[03:12:54.620 --> 03:12:57.700]   the exclusivity of secret societies.
[03:12:57.700 --> 03:12:59.900]   And so like there's a,
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:02.940]   there's a gravitational force that pulls powerful people
[03:13:02.940 --> 03:13:03.900]   to these societies.
[03:13:03.900 --> 03:13:05.020]   - Exclusive.
[03:13:05.020 --> 03:13:05.860]   Only certain.
[03:13:05.860 --> 03:13:07.660]   And you also notice something goes back to
[03:13:07.660 --> 03:13:09.020]   when we were talking about much earlier,
[03:13:09.020 --> 03:13:10.260]   when we were talking about intelligence.
[03:13:10.260 --> 03:13:12.340]   Remember mice, ego.
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:13.180]   - Ego, yeah.
[03:13:13.180 --> 03:13:15.100]   - As a piece of recruitment and control.
[03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:18.060]   That's a great Achilles heel in human beings.
[03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:21.260]   The exploitation of ego.
[03:13:21.260 --> 03:13:23.180]   - And of course if we go back to the conversation
[03:13:23.180 --> 03:13:24.620]   of intelligence agencies,
[03:13:24.620 --> 03:13:30.540]   it would be very efficient and beneficial
[03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:32.920]   for intelligence agencies to infiltrate
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:34.420]   the secret societies, right?
[03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:36.020]   'Cause that's where the powerful people are.
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:37.980]   - Yeah, or the secret societies to infiltrate
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:39.100]   the intelligence agencies.
[03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:39.940]   - Oh boy.
[03:13:39.940 --> 03:13:44.580]   Well, I mean, that's actually in all the lectures,
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:49.380]   I kinda had a sense that intelligence agencies themselves
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:53.100]   are kind of secret societies, right?
[03:13:53.100 --> 03:13:54.420]   - Well, it comes down,
[03:13:54.420 --> 03:13:56.940]   I give you my definition of secret societies,
[03:13:56.940 --> 03:13:57.760]   what they come down to.
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:00.140]   One is that generally their existence isn't secret.
[03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:01.940]   It's what they do is secret.
[03:14:01.940 --> 03:14:03.060]   It's what's in the box
[03:14:03.060 --> 03:14:05.020]   as opposed to the existence of the box.
[03:14:05.020 --> 03:14:07.980]   So one of the most important criterions
[03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:12.180]   is that they are self-selecting.
[03:14:12.180 --> 03:14:14.160]   You just don't join, they pick you.
[03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:15.500]   They decide whether or not you're going to,
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:18.900]   they admit you and oftentimes they will sort of recruit you.
[03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:22.520]   Once you have been recruited,
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:25.940]   you have to pass tests and initiations.
[03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:31.880]   And you also have to swear oaths of loyalty.
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:36.600]   Those are always very, very critical.
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:38.500]   So broadly speaking,
[03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:41.300]   what entrance into an intelligence organization does,
[03:14:41.300 --> 03:14:43.120]   they decide whether you get in,
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:45.140]   you just don't automatically get the job.
[03:14:45.140 --> 03:14:49.260]   You have to pass tests, a lie detector test, for instance,
[03:14:49.260 --> 03:14:53.940]   field training tests, a whole variety of tests,
[03:14:53.940 --> 03:14:55.960]   and then you're sworn to secrecy.
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:00.080]   You never talk about what you do, ever,
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:03.540]   or there will be dire consequences.
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:09.020]   So the method is very much the same,
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:13.300]   and also this idea of creating a kind of insular group.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:17.860]   The organization is us,
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:23.380]   and everyone else is outside of that.
[03:15:23.380 --> 03:15:26.500]   We are guardians of special knowledge.
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:29.460]   See, this is the type of thing that would generally happen
[03:15:29.460 --> 03:15:30.660]   if you questioned whatever
[03:15:30.660 --> 03:15:32.300]   any kind of intelligence agency did.
[03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:34.220]   Well, we know things that you don't.
[03:15:34.220 --> 03:15:37.000]   Why? Because we're the organization that knows things.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:38.440]   We collect information.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:39.840]   We know the secrets.
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:41.440]   We guard the secrets.
[03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:45.800]   Therefore, if we tell you, you must believe us.
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:48.360]   - I have this sense that there are
[03:15:48.360 --> 03:15:51.640]   very powerful secret societies operating today,
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:53.700]   and we don't really know or understand them,
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:56.760]   and the conspiracy theories in spirit
[03:15:56.760 --> 03:15:58.400]   might have something to them,
[03:15:58.400 --> 03:16:00.540]   but are actually factually not correct.
[03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:06.460]   It's like an effective, powerful secret society
[03:16:06.460 --> 03:16:08.820]   or intelligence agency is not going to
[03:16:08.820 --> 03:16:13.560]   let you know anything that it doesn't want you to know.
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:16.220]   - They'll probably mislead you if you can stay close.
[03:16:16.220 --> 03:16:19.020]   So I think the question is,
[03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:22.700]   what's the most powerful or important secret society?
[03:16:22.700 --> 03:16:24.780]   Probably the one you don't know about,
[03:16:24.780 --> 03:16:26.980]   one that doesn't advertise its existence,
[03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:31.920]   the one which is never known anywhere under its real name.
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:36.520]   You've got things like the Bohemian Club.
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:38.720]   You've got the Bilderbergers,
[03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:43.040]   which is another sort of, you know, formed in the 1950s,
[03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:44.720]   largely the creation of a guy
[03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:47.480]   by the name of Josef Rettinger,
[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:50.560]   Polish, mysterious, appears in a note where,
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:55.560]   a schemer for years, a man expelled from Britain,
[03:16:55.760 --> 03:16:59.460]   France, and the United States at one point or another,
[03:16:59.460 --> 03:17:01.740]   long active in the Mexican labor movement.
[03:17:01.740 --> 03:17:03.300]   All right, okay.
[03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:06.300]   Rettinger is a mysterious figure.
[03:17:06.300 --> 03:17:07.420]   In fact, his,
[03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:09.080]   I think there was even a book written about him
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:11.620]   called "Eminence Grise," "Grey Eminence,"
[03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:12.460]   the fellow who was,
[03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:14.260]   the front man for the Bilderbergers
[03:17:14.260 --> 03:17:16.920]   was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,
[03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:18.500]   who was at one point a Nazi,
[03:17:18.500 --> 03:17:21.100]   and then a Dutch freedom fighter.
[03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:23.260]   All right, take your pick.
[03:17:23.260 --> 03:17:28.260]   But Rettinger is the moving hand behind the whole thing,
[03:17:28.260 --> 03:17:31.560]   and I'll be damned if I can figure out who Rettinger is.
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:36.040]   So the idea is that, well, you get like influential people
[03:17:36.040 --> 03:17:39.680]   in media, business, politics,
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:42.540]   and you bring them together just to talk,
[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:48.560]   to try to find common answers or common questions.
[03:17:49.420 --> 03:17:53.320]   It's all very much sort of Western Europe, Anglo-European.
[03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:56.120]   I mean, it's all very closely sort of connected to NATO,
[03:17:56.120 --> 03:18:00.520]   the whole concept of a kind of Atlanticist world,
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:05.620]   which is essentially the Anglo-American combine
[03:18:05.620 --> 03:18:07.140]   combined with Western Europe.
[03:18:07.140 --> 03:18:10.680]   But you got a bunch of these things.
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:15.240]   I mean, the Council on Foreign Relations
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:16.840]   is very similar to that,
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:20.840]   and the Bilderbergers, and there's an overlap
[03:18:20.840 --> 03:18:22.660]   with the Bohemian Club,
[03:18:22.660 --> 03:18:27.660]   and then you've got the Penae Circle, or Le Circle,
[03:18:27.660 --> 03:18:30.280]   which is more military,
[03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:35.280]   but also linked to the so-called secret Gladio,
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:37.900]   you know, the idea if the Soviets overran Western Europe,
[03:18:37.900 --> 03:18:40.400]   there would be a stay-behind organization called Gladio.
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:42.100]   There'd be these freedom fighters.
[03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:44.460]   So the question I have about that
[03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:47.540]   is that how many secret organizations do you need?
[03:18:47.540 --> 03:18:50.260]   I mean, why all these separate groups,
[03:18:50.260 --> 03:18:53.340]   which often seem to have the same people into them?
[03:18:53.340 --> 03:18:56.380]   - Yeah, there's a, I mean, the closer I look,
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:58.340]   the more I wonder the same question we asked
[03:18:58.340 --> 03:19:00.300]   about the Russian intelligence agencies
[03:19:00.300 --> 03:19:02.320]   is where is the center of power?
[03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:05.140]   It seems to be very hard to figure out.
[03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:07.100]   Does the secrecy scare you?
[03:19:07.100 --> 03:19:09.580]   - Well, I guess on one level,
[03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:10.980]   I'm comforted that there's somebody
[03:19:10.980 --> 03:19:12.380]   actually making decisions,
[03:19:14.060 --> 03:19:16.140]   as opposed to, I mean, what do you want?
[03:19:16.140 --> 03:19:17.540]   Do you want chaos,
[03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:21.020]   or do you want everything kind of rigidly controlled?
[03:19:21.020 --> 03:19:26.020]   And I don't put much stock in the idea
[03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:29.340]   that there actually is some small group
[03:19:29.340 --> 03:19:30.980]   of people running everything,
[03:19:30.980 --> 03:19:35.180]   because if they were, it would operate more efficiently.
[03:19:35.180 --> 03:19:39.740]   I do think that there are various disparate groups
[03:19:39.740 --> 03:19:43.460]   of people who think that they're running things,
[03:19:43.460 --> 03:19:48.460]   or try to, and that's what concerns me
[03:19:48.460 --> 03:19:51.180]   more than anything else.
[03:19:51.180 --> 03:19:53.140]   Well, I hate to go back to them again,
[03:19:53.140 --> 03:19:53.980]   'cause especially bringing up,
[03:19:53.980 --> 03:19:55.100]   you go back to the Nazis,
[03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:57.340]   they had their whole idea about a new world order,
[03:19:57.340 --> 03:19:58.940]   and they only had 12 years to do it.
[03:19:58.940 --> 03:20:00.220]   Look what a mess they made.
[03:20:00.220 --> 03:20:03.000]   I mean, look at the damage,
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.140]   the physical damage that can be done
[03:20:05.140 --> 03:20:10.540]   by an idea inspiring a relatively small group of people
[03:20:10.540 --> 03:20:12.220]   controlling a nation.
[03:20:13.220 --> 03:20:18.220]   Based upon some sort of racial or ideological fantasy
[03:20:18.220 --> 03:20:21.460]   that has no real basis in reality,
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:23.440]   and yet guides their actions.
[03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:29.220]   It's this differentiation that I always make,
[03:20:29.220 --> 03:20:31.420]   and I would try to get across to students between,
[03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:34.900]   always be clear about what you know and what you believe.
[03:20:34.900 --> 03:20:37.840]   You don't know many things.
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:43.500]   You know your name, you know when you were born,
[03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:46.660]   you probably know who your father is,
[03:20:46.660 --> 03:20:50.500]   but that's not absolute unless you've had a DNA test,
[03:20:50.500 --> 03:20:52.840]   and only if you trust DNA tests.
[03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:55.460]   So you know who your mother is,
[03:20:55.460 --> 03:20:57.740]   you believe this man is your father.
[03:20:57.740 --> 03:20:58.560]   Why?
[03:20:58.560 --> 03:20:59.980]   Because your mother told you he was.
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:01.540]   So you believe things generally
[03:21:01.540 --> 03:21:04.800]   because someone has told you this is to be true,
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:08.320]   but you don't really know for sure.
[03:21:09.820 --> 03:21:12.220]   Well because we know so little,
[03:21:12.220 --> 03:21:14.260]   we tend to go by beliefs.
[03:21:14.260 --> 03:21:17.220]   So we believe in this, we believe in that.
[03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:20.340]   You know, you believe that your cult leader
[03:21:20.340 --> 03:21:22.340]   is the answer to everything.
[03:21:22.340 --> 03:21:24.740]   And it seems to be very, very easy
[03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:26.780]   to get people to believe things.
[03:21:26.780 --> 03:21:30.880]   And then what happens is that whether or not
[03:21:30.880 --> 03:21:34.300]   those beliefs have any real basis in reality,
[03:21:34.300 --> 03:21:36.280]   they begin to influence your actions.
[03:21:39.060 --> 03:21:42.460]   - So here again, regrettably in some ways
[03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:43.740]   to bring it back to the Nazis,
[03:21:43.740 --> 03:21:45.220]   what were the Nazis convinced of?
[03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:48.780]   They were convinced that Jews were basically evil aliens.
[03:21:48.780 --> 03:21:49.940]   That's what it comes down to.
[03:21:49.940 --> 03:21:51.220]   They weren't really humans.
[03:21:51.220 --> 03:21:53.460]   There's some sort of evil contamination
[03:21:53.460 --> 03:21:55.060]   which we must eradicate.
[03:21:55.060 --> 03:21:59.420]   And they set out to do that.
[03:21:59.420 --> 03:22:02.840]   - And they were sure that there's just a few problems
[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:04.740]   that can be solved, and once you solve them,
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:06.420]   that you have this beautiful utopia
[03:22:06.420 --> 03:22:08.380]   where everything would be just perfect.
[03:22:08.380 --> 03:22:09.220]   It'd be great.
[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:10.500]   And we can just get there.
[03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:14.500]   And I think it's really strong belief in a global utopia.
[03:22:14.500 --> 03:22:17.320]   It just never goes right.
[03:22:17.320 --> 03:22:21.500]   It seems like impossible to know the truth in it.
[03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:22.860]   - For some reason, not long ago,
[03:22:22.860 --> 03:22:26.380]   I was listening on YouTube to old Wobbly songs.
[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:31.820]   The Workers of the World.
[03:22:31.820 --> 03:22:33.740]   I don't know why.
[03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:36.940]   I didn't know there was a whole album of Wobbly songs.
[03:22:36.940 --> 03:22:41.100]   But, and there was one of them called Commonwealth of Toil.
[03:22:41.100 --> 03:22:42.380]   And it's, like most of them,
[03:22:42.380 --> 03:22:45.640]   they're sort of taken from gospel songs.
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:48.900]   And it's talking about in the future,
[03:22:48.900 --> 03:22:50.820]   how wonderful everything will be
[03:22:50.820 --> 03:22:55.820]   in the Commonwealth of Toil that will be.
[03:22:55.820 --> 03:23:01.680]   And now these are revolutionary leftists.
[03:23:01.680 --> 03:23:04.940]   In this case, Wobblies, but nonetheless.
[03:23:04.940 --> 03:23:09.000]   It's like a prayer for communism, everything.
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.780]   Now in the future, everything will be good
[03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:15.220]   because the Earth will be shared by the toilers.
[03:23:15.220 --> 03:23:19.860]   And from each his abilities to each according to his need.
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:23.860]   And it's this kind of sweet little song in some way.
[03:23:23.860 --> 03:23:27.060]   But I'm just sort of imagining this.
[03:23:27.060 --> 03:23:28.460]   If I was gonna stage that,
[03:23:28.460 --> 03:23:30.940]   I'd have this choir of children singing it
[03:23:30.940 --> 03:23:33.700]   with a huge hammer and sickle behind them.
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:36.700]   Because that's what it's combining.
[03:23:36.700 --> 03:23:40.300]   And you can think that the sentiments
[03:23:40.300 --> 03:23:41.740]   that are expressed in that song,
[03:23:41.740 --> 03:23:45.100]   which are legitimate in some way,
[03:23:45.100 --> 03:23:51.340]   of all the horrors that that then leads to.
[03:23:51.340 --> 03:23:55.000]   - It is fascinating about humans.
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.100]   A beautiful idea on paper,
[03:23:57.100 --> 03:24:00.820]   an innocent little idea about a utopian future
[03:24:00.820 --> 03:24:02.740]   can lead to so much suffering.
[03:24:03.660 --> 03:24:05.020]   And so much destruction.
[03:24:05.020 --> 03:24:07.140]   And totally, the unintended consequences
[03:24:07.140 --> 03:24:07.980]   that you see described.
[03:24:07.980 --> 03:24:09.980]   - The law of unintended consequences.
[03:24:09.980 --> 03:24:11.140]   - And we learn from it.
[03:24:11.140 --> 03:24:12.420]   I mean, that's why history is important.
[03:24:12.420 --> 03:24:13.820]   We learn from it, hopefully.
[03:24:13.820 --> 03:24:14.660]   - Do we?
[03:24:14.660 --> 03:24:17.880]   - Slowly, or slow learners.
[03:24:17.880 --> 03:24:21.600]   - I'm unconvinced of that, but perhaps it's.
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:26.260]   - Speaking of unconvinced, what gives you hope?
[03:24:26.260 --> 03:24:29.820]   If human beings are still here,
[03:24:29.820 --> 03:24:33.500]   maybe expanding out into the cosmos,
[03:24:33.500 --> 03:24:37.180]   1,000, 5,000, 10,000 years from now,
[03:24:37.180 --> 03:24:41.060]   what gives you hope about that future?
[03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:42.740]   About it even being a possible future?
[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:44.000]   About it happening?
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:49.000]   - Most people are cooperative and kind most of the time.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:56.580]   And that's one of those things
[03:24:56.580 --> 03:25:00.060]   that can usually be depended upon.
[03:25:00.060 --> 03:25:03.220]   And usually you'll get back to what you put into it.
[03:25:03.220 --> 03:25:09.380]   Another thing that I have like a weird fascination
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:13.340]   of watching are people who have meltdowns on airplanes.
[03:25:13.340 --> 03:25:19.860]   'Cause it's just bizarre.
[03:25:19.860 --> 03:25:21.620]   - It's fascinating to watch, yeah.
[03:25:21.620 --> 03:25:23.260]   - The people who will, you know,
[03:25:23.260 --> 03:25:26.020]   there's some sort of psychotic break that occurs,
[03:25:26.020 --> 03:25:29.300]   and it's always gonna end the same way.
[03:25:29.300 --> 03:25:31.780]   The cops are gonna come on and drag you off the plane.
[03:25:31.780 --> 03:25:35.980]   Now true, and you're gonna inconvenience everybody there,
[03:25:35.980 --> 03:25:38.860]   and usually at some point they don't care about that.
[03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:41.060]   That's the one little sense of power that they have.
[03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:44.540]   So they have some sort of sense of powerlessness.
[03:25:44.540 --> 03:25:45.980]   And if their only way of power
[03:25:45.980 --> 03:25:48.880]   is just to piss off everybody else on that plane,
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:51.500]   they're gonna go ahead and do it,
[03:25:51.500 --> 03:25:56.140]   even though it's going to lead nowhere for them.
[03:25:56.140 --> 03:25:59.180]   - And there's similar, sometimes psychological behavior
[03:25:59.180 --> 03:26:00.460]   in traffic.
[03:26:00.460 --> 03:26:01.300]   - Oh, the road rage thing.
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:02.460]   - The road rage, yeah.
[03:26:02.460 --> 03:26:03.300]   It's fascinating.
[03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:04.980]   - And I bet that most, there again,
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:06.900]   those are all people who up to some point
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:10.220]   were cooperative and kind and polite.
[03:26:10.220 --> 03:26:12.320]   And then they snap.
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:16.640]   So those are all part of the human makeup as well.
[03:26:16.640 --> 03:26:19.460]   - But also part of the human makeup,
[03:26:19.460 --> 03:26:22.700]   difference between humans and chimps,
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:24.580]   is the ability to get together,
[03:26:24.580 --> 03:26:28.380]   cooperate on a mass scale over an idea,
[03:26:28.380 --> 03:26:30.260]   create things like the Roman Empire did,
[03:26:30.260 --> 03:26:34.140]   laws that prevent us and protect us
[03:26:34.140 --> 03:26:37.060]   from crazy human behavior,
[03:26:37.060 --> 03:26:38.740]   manifestations of a man's--
[03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:40.540]   - Well, human beings are just weird animals.
[03:26:40.540 --> 03:26:41.380]   It's not getting around.
[03:26:41.380 --> 03:26:43.900]   They're just completely peculiar.
[03:26:43.900 --> 03:26:46.220]   I'm not sure that we're altogether natural.
[03:26:46.220 --> 03:26:49.180]   - But I think we are altogether beautiful.
[03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:50.660]   There is something magical about humans,
[03:26:50.660 --> 03:26:52.540]   and I hope humans stay here,
[03:26:52.540 --> 03:26:56.820]   even as we get advanced robots walking around everywhere,
[03:26:56.820 --> 03:26:59.460]   more and more intelligent robots
[03:26:59.460 --> 03:27:01.020]   that claim to have consciousness,
[03:27:01.020 --> 03:27:03.020]   that claim they love you,
[03:27:03.020 --> 03:27:06.200]   that increasingly take over our world.
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:11.200]   I hope this magical thing that makes us human still persists.
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:12.740]   - Well, let us hope so.
[03:27:12.740 --> 03:27:15.780]   - Rick, you're an incredible person.
[03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:16.620]   - Well, thank you.
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:18.940]   - You've done so much fascinating work,
[03:27:18.940 --> 03:27:20.100]   and it's really an honor.
[03:27:20.100 --> 03:27:21.500]   - I've never had anybody ask me
[03:27:21.500 --> 03:27:24.820]   as many interesting questions as you have, so.
[03:27:24.820 --> 03:27:25.660]   - Thank you so much.
[03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:27.260]   - So many questions.
[03:27:27.260 --> 03:27:28.120]   - This was so fun.
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:29.380]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[03:27:29.380 --> 03:27:31.060]   - Well, thank you.
[03:27:31.060 --> 03:27:32.620]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:33.860]   with Rick Spence.
[03:27:33.860 --> 03:27:34.900]   To support this podcast,
[03:27:34.900 --> 03:27:37.500]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:27:37.500 --> 03:27:39.460]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:27:39.460 --> 03:27:41.260]   from John F. Kennedy.
[03:27:41.260 --> 03:27:44.660]   "The very word secrecy is repugnant
[03:27:44.660 --> 03:27:46.660]   "in a free and open society,
[03:27:46.660 --> 03:27:48.800]   "and we are as a people inherently
[03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:51.960]   "and historically opposed to secret societies,
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:54.860]   "to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[03:27:55.620 --> 03:27:57.920]   "We decided long ago that the dangers
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:00.580]   "of excessive and unwarranted concealment
[03:28:00.580 --> 03:28:04.640]   "of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers
[03:28:04.640 --> 03:28:06.600]   "which are cited to justify it."
[03:28:06.600 --> 03:28:08.740]   Thank you for listening,
[03:28:08.740 --> 03:28:10.780]   and hope to see you next time.
[03:28:10.780 --> 03:28:13.360]   (upbeat music)
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.940]   (upbeat music)
