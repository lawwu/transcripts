[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast and in this episode I have
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.560]   a special guest with me, Dan Andrews from the Tropical MBA.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.560]   Say hello.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.160]   - Hey, thanks for having me man.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.160]   This is cool.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   - No worries.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.000]   I thank you for joining.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.900]   So I first discovered the Tropical MBA when I started Financial Samurai in 2009 and you
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.480]   also started the Tropical MBA in 2009.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.200]   And one of the things that was so interesting about your site was that you were living,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   I think in Thailand at the time or somewhere in Asia, and I wanted to live that digital
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.480]   nomad lifestyle because it was the financial crisis and the recession and you were living
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480]   it.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   You were living the dream.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160]   So I'd love for you to talk about why you started the site and how did you get the gumption
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.920]   to go out to Thailand and to do the things you were doing?
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.040]   - Well first off it started with China, which was my, I'm not a good business person necessarily,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.000]   but I would walk around and touch everything and be like, "Is this made in China yet?"
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   That was my way of having a business idea.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.720]   So I become acquainted with sending faxes and emails abroad and then waiting 12 hours
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.160]   for them to come back and this idea of globalization was very real to me when I started reading
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.800]   books like 4-Hour Workweek and stuff like that and I'm like, "Yeah, I do work at 9pm
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   to make sure that our partners abroad are carrying on."
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.080]   So 4-Hour Workweek was kind of a really seminal book for a lot of people because at that time
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.400]   people felt like the workday didn't end at 5 and that felt new.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.720]   I don't know, that felt like, or just something that was very frustrating about our careers,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.160]   that it was just like all the time.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.760]   And so I started spending more time in China and then when I realized SEO was going to
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   be a thing.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.240]   >> So search engine optimization for those who don't know.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.040]   >> That's right.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.240]   But also that we couldn't afford it as a small manufacturing company.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.720]   I started seeing these gurus pop up online, people like John Jonas who were saying, "Hey,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.600]   did you know that there's over 100 million Filipinos that speak English?"
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.480]   And I was like, "No, I did not know that at all."
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.780]   And started kind of going down that rabbit hole and with the combination of traveling
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.000]   to Asia I got a sense that we could really build a strong digital marketing presence
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.120]   in Asia and that's really how the whole journey started for me.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   >> And before that decision to move to China and do that, what was your educational background
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.560]   and how did you decide, "Well, let's just go to China because I don't think most people
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   would think that."
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.760]   I think 60 plus percent of Americans don't even have a passport.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.680]   >> Yeah, I probably had early formative travel experiences which blew my mind and I didn't
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.600]   really control my time or my location my whole life.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.080]   I was always in school or at a job and it was incredibly frustrating to me especially
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.880]   as my work hours and my salary started to go up.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.240]   I remember when I started making $100,000 a year I was working for a small manufacturing
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.840]   company and I realized, "My God, I can't travel anywhere."
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.880]   I mean between dentist appointments and family responsibilities and some fun here and there,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.600]   I really can't do much even though I've reached this goal I had for myself to "make a lot
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.260]   of money."
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.440]   My background was I studied philosophy and with the sense that I might be able to go
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   into academia so I'd have the freedom to read and write for a living.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.200]   What I found was it was extremely competitive.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.160]   The compensation was really poor and also you got kind of locked into these random locations
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   like "Yes, Iowa State" or whatever.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   That would be a really good job and I thought, "I can't."
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680]   >> Oh, but that's where the Writers Guild is, right?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   That's like the top.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> Well, yeah, I mean for sure but you have to live in Iowa so I don't know if I'd make
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   the trade.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> Okay.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.320]   Iowa's got some good stakes though but yeah, I hear you.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.720]   >> Yeah, I mean it was always just sort of a thing in the back of my mind that I guess
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.240]   I equated travel with freedom and that I would ultimately need to find a career that would
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.400]   allow me that freedom.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.100]   >> Yeah, why not do both, right?
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.840]   Instead of maybe what most people do is they work all their years in one country and then
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.480]   when they retire, then they go and travel the world.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.000]   >> Essentially, yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.840]   >> How long were you in -- when did you go to Thailand and how long were you there?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.200]   I think was it in Chiang Mai?
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.280]   >> So basically what happened was I moved to the Philippines to start recruiting a back
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   office staff.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.800]   We started hiring developers and writers and I was spending a lot of time in Manila and
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.720]   things thinking, "Oh, you know, Manila's a great place to hire but not really where I
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   want to live."
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.120]   >> So I started exploring the region and at that time, we were having so much fun.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.240]   I thought, "Man, I bet other people would want to come out and do this."
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.400]   I bet people would take a pay cut to come work for an e-commerce company.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.920]   And so that's where the Tropical MBA came from.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.020]   It was literally like, "Come to the tropics and I will teach you how to be a marketer
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.640]   for an e-commerce company.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.240]   I will teach you SEO.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.960]   I will teach you all these skill sets and then you'll be able to go start your own company
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.640]   in the next couple of years."
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   And that's really, it wasn't even a blog at the beginning.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.520]   It was really just a job offer.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.480]   "Hey, I'm paying this developer in Manila a thousand bucks a month.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.520]   I'll pay you two thousand bucks a month and just come hang out with me and we're going
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   to build this business."
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   And that was kind of the concept.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.280]   >> I mean, yeah, I was very back in the financial crisis.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.920]   I was thinking to myself, "If I lost my job, I would hopefully get a severance and then
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.000]   maybe I would try to do that internship.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   Even if I couldn't get that internship, I would go anyway and just try to live my life
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.840]   out there and see what you all are up to."
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.360]   Because it was the new frontier then and now it seems pretty ubiquitous about people making
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.560]   money online.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.360]   During your business time, where did the main source of revenue come from?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.140]   Like what was e-commerce but then you had marketing.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.140]   So how did that look like?
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.880]   >> Just to piggyback on that instinct, Sam, it's funny you mentioned that because we had
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680]   ended up doing 12 internships and a lot of it was fun.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.080]   One is a very famous dividend investor right now.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.320]   A handful of them turned out to be very wealthy.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.280]   It was a lot of people that were on the fast track that just wanted to see what was going
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   on.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.860]   And then the other half was people just out of college that wanted to do the classic internship.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.880]   So it was this very vibrant community when we ultimately got a villa in Bali and had
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   a pool.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.240]   >> I mean, that sounds amazing.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.920]   >> It was super fun and it really felt like a moment.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.840]   We couldn't believe that you could do it.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.760]   It was still kind of that, "This is so crazy.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.080]   We're making more than we made in jobs, but here we are in this affordable, fun paradise."
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.800]   Now it's a cliche, I think, the digital nomad thing, but at the time it really felt special.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.680]   It really felt, to me at least, like a dream come true.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.800]   So at the time we ran a company that had a warehouse in Temecula, California that warehoused
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.440]   parking products.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.820]   So especially valet key stands that you see outside of hotels.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.480]   That was our best product.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.400]   And so in Manila, in Bali, we'd be building this website called the valetspot.com.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   You can still go there.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.440]   We'd be doing outreach to partners.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.520]   We'd be putting up SEO optimized articles.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   Maybe one of the big challenges for us at the time was there's not a lot of good e-commerce
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.840]   solutions like Shopify today.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.280]   So we were building our own shopping carts and website using systems like, I think at
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.120]   the time we were using Drupal, which is quite a complicated web framework.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.280]   So that's why we needed these developers.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.800]   In California, I was getting guys nights and weekends for like $3,500 a month.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.680]   And in Manila, I sat right next to a partner who was a high level developer for a thousand
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.880]   bucks a month.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.520]   And that was the arbitrage that we were taking advantage of at the time.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.240]   So for listeners listening to this, I mean, that sounds so random.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.160]   You're creating valet parts in California in a factory and then you're in Asia arbitraging
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.320]   the developers.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.960]   I can't even imagine how to start thinking about that.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.640]   With listeners thinking, most of the folks probably have day jobs, maybe they're investors,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   entrepreneurs, I don't know.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.960]   How do you even conceptualize that idea and then execute?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.440]   Because it feels like a lot of people have a lot of ideas, a lot of places to exploit
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.080]   profits, but execution is a real big problem.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.600]   I think one of the mistakes people make is they read a book like 4-Hour Workweek or Dan
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.520]   Kennedy or name your business guru and they say, "I want a business like that."
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.660]   But then to forget about the fact that you're already probably getting paid a lot of money
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.040]   for your skill set, kind of start with where you're at, like a moneyed skill set.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   At the time, I did contract manufacturing.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.240]   That was what I was good at.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.160]   If Sam, you come to me and you say, "I want 150 tables that are built out of this material
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.120]   and I want them delivered in St. Louis in six weeks."
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   I would go to China, I would have my designers in California figure it out and we would do
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.120]   that for 150 pieces.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.680]   Now at the time, I'm starting to think to myself, this really sucks that every time
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.320]   Sam or Paul or Jane calls me, I got to build whatever they're talking about.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.440]   I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if I could just make a thousand of something and keep
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   selling it?"
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.560]   So that was a problem I saw.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.040]   And then we say, "Well, how would then you identify what to build?"
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.680]   And at that time, there was this concept called keyword research that people on the internet
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.560]   were starting to talk about.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.360]   And I was learning about it because we were trying to market this contract manufacturing.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.600]   I thought, "Wow, you can really figure out how many people every month search for something."
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.920]   And you can get a sense for whether or not they're buying intent keywords.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.160]   And so we had all these ideas like, "We're going to do cat furniture and dog furniture
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.820]   and we're going to do..."
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.480]   It was all across the board.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.800]   And we found this really tasty small niche of valet parking products.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   And when we started to do research on the incumbent players, we thought, "Man, we're
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.720]   actually a little bit more sophisticated.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.680]   Some of these people are welding in Los Angeles and then they're shipping on pallets."
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.840]   We do knockdown fabrication.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   We build in China at high-class factories.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.480]   There was all these things that gave us the confidence that, "Hey, maybe we could get
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   involved in this space."
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.080]   And we just pieced it all together.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080]   And of course, we were broke.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.660]   We were young kids.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.980]   And so we were like, "Well, we can't afford to build an e-commerce site."
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.000]   So that's really where the Philippines connection came in.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.080]   So we just pieced it together by what was right in front of us and trying to improve
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.960]   our situation rather than saying, "Oh, I'm going to be Tim Ferriss and sell supplements
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.260]   on the internet."
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.660]   We were inspired by that.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.480]   But we looked at what we were already doing and good at in our current relationships and
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.780]   kind of improved from there.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.240]   That's fascinating.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.260]   And you actually just kind of went and did it.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.260]   So for me, I...
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.200]   Well, part of the reason I did it, Sam, is that I didn't have a lot going for me.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.440]   I mean, you know what I mean?
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.480]   I think it's a lot harder if you have a great career, if you went to a great school.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   That's true.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.400]   I don't think I necessarily would have taken this path, but I don't know.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.880]   I didn't go to a great school.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.840]   I didn't have a great career in front of me.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.760]   I was just working really hard for a small manufacturing company.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.880]   I thought, "It's better to try out the Thailand thing."
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.840]   If I'm going to toil away at my desk for the next 30 years to go to Thailand someday, I
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.320]   might as well test it out to see if it's worth it.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.540]   Where did you go to school and how much did you make before you decided to be an entrepreneur?
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.400]   So I went to Clemson.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   I was lucky enough to get a scholarship my second two years.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   It was about $14,000, $15,000 a year.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   I studied philosophy.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.480]   So I accumulated about $45,000, $50,000 in debt during college.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.600]   And so I kind of had that.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.280]   And then when I came out my first job, I think I made $32,000 a year.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.640]   And within a four-year period, I got four or five-year period, I got not up to $100,000.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.720]   And that was kind of like the ... I was still in debt at that time.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.960]   That was at the moment in my mind when I thought, "I don't think a higher salary solves this
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.040]   problem for me."
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.600]   I've got a spending problem.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:27.360]   I've got an earning ... Because I was living in San Diego, I've got a cap on my income.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.440]   I'm going to have to work for a very long time to get percentage increases.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   And then I also have a lack of freedom and time.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.240]   I used to do these calculations where between doing my laundry and purchasing new khaki
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:46.200]   pants and driving to the office on the 5, I really only had a few hours a week to invest
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.480]   in myself.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.160]   I was listening to these books and podcasts on the drive.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   And I realized I didn't have enough time to implement or chase after the things I was
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.320]   learning.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.400]   And I think it was the combination there that really started to crack my worldview.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.320]   And I thought, "Man, I need time.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   That's my constraint here."
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:14.600]   Now, you said you were making 100 grand four years after college, so around '26, '27, but
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.400]   you still had some student debt.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.360]   Did you have a financial kind of buffer or target where you had to save up before you
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   said, "You know what?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.440]   I'm going to try this and take this leap of faith"?
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   No.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   No.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   I was just saying, "Well ..." Let's go for it.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   Not at all.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   Not that I recall.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.840]   I mean, I probably had $2,000 or $3,000 in my bank account, maybe $6,000 or $10,000.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.400]   It wasn't a lot.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.660]   And the buffer for me was cash flow.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.640]   So at the time, I had started this business and it was cash flowing.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.520]   And I remember I walked into my boss's office and it was a terrifying conversation.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.400]   I should have read your book first.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.920]   And I said, "Look, I got to go."
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   And he's like, "What do you mean you got to go?"
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.560]   I was like, "I got to see this through.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.080]   I got to figure out what this business is going to be about, what web marketing is going
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   to become."
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.320]   And I said, "I think I'm going to go to like Vietnam or Buenos Aires."
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.760]   I was 27.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.000]   And I remember he said to me, he said, "You can't go."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   Well, I was like, "Well, what do you mean?"
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.280]   He's like, "Well, I'd like to continue working with you."
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.440]   He's like, "I want to see what you're going to see too.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   I want to be involved in the web marketing stuff."
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   And I said, "Okay.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.160]   Well, you can't keep paying me $100,000.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.360]   So how about you pay me $50,000 and we'll work on the stuff together?"
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.320]   And sure enough, we worked together for the next four years.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.160]   That $50,000 I made from him was a critical part of my entrepreneurial journey.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.680]   That severance or that consulting gig with my former employer made it so much easier
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.520]   to be more aggressive with my own business.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.920]   And because that client had cash to invest.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.160]   So I took another $50,000 from that company, which at the time had about 40 employees,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.240]   and I was investing that money into a web marketing team on their behalf.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.860]   And I learned a lot from spending and investing that money.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.800]   And so it turned out that it's a classic example of if you close a door, maybe another would
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   open.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.880]   I would never have expected that to happen.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.840]   I wasn't depending on it, but it became a critical part of my journey.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   Wow.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.680]   Actually, that sounds like a great severance.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.720]   Great cash flow, great backup plan.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.640]   I mean, that's really smart in being intentional to give you that financial buffer to take
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.320]   the leap of faith and do something else.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.720]   Because as you know, most businesses fail after maybe five years, definitely after 10
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.000]   years, they just can't keep on grinding because of whatever exogenous variable.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.220]   So that's pretty amazing.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220]   And so now-
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.200]   Well, one of the ways your audience can apply that is, my partner recently did this where
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   if you make a good amount of money as a professional, you can typically downshift and fractionalize
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.240]   out your skill set for a small amount of time of your week.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.760]   So as an example, if you make $150,000 a year as a director of marketing, you could take
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.680]   on one client for $2,500 a month and do one day or $5,000 a month and do one or two days
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.080]   of work for that money.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.020]   And then now you've freed up three or four days.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.600]   In particular, if that client has budget and you're just deploying and managing the budget,
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.840]   which was my case, so I actually didn't work at all for that money, I simply deployed the
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.960]   budget and managed the team.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.920]   So it took me half a day a week and that was a really good deal.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.600]   Got it.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.800]   Now just on procuring products from China, so I have a business idea.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   I play a lot of tennis and my shoes, the soles, they wear unevenly.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.600]   And so on the outside of the sole, it just wears and then it's just unbalanced.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.240]   So how hard or easy would it be for me to come up with a prototype and then go to China
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.480]   and say, "Manufacture these soles that I could just plug on to my sole of my shoe so it's
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.480]   flat again and then I can just elongate the life of my shoe," because the sole is what
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.920]   wears out first, for example.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   Cool product idea.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   I love it.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:14.080]   Now I'm waiting to hear your golf swing aid coming next.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.400]   For me, nowadays, the hardest part about manufacturing in China is really the demand part.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   From which side?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.600]   Well, making sure you can sell the things.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.440]   So for example, if you told me, "Here's what I suspect the margins will be," which would
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.120]   be pretty easy for us to figure out.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.800]   Yeah, 50% margins.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   So then we can project out on a pro forma, we get a sense for what this is going to mean
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.640]   for us financially if we can sell X number of them.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.400]   Now that's the hard part.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.280]   If you can figure out the demand part, if I come to you, Sam, and I say, "I think based
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.560]   on this funnel I built or whatever, we're going to sell 10,000 units in our first 12
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.960]   months," then for sure we can get it made.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.120]   The hard part is how are you going to fund your trip to China?
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.640]   How are you going to invest in that relationship?
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.000]   The hardest part of the equation with 90% of products is the demand side.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.220]   Interesting.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.080]   When you go to most of these industries in China, it's been there, done that.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.640]   Yeah, they have built replacement soles.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.800]   So it's just a matter of digging into the details of what that's going to mean in your
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   particular case.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   Interesting.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   Yeah, because I talk to a lot of entrepreneurs.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.120]   Depends how innovative, I guess, is what I'm getting at.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   I mean, this is going to be really innovative, cool colors, amazing material.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.720]   It's going to make your shoe greater.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.240]   It's going to make you taller, all that good stuff.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.000]   And I talk to a lot of entrepreneurs who have product, but their number one problem is distribution
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   to get that demand.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.760]   So for Financial Samurai, there is distribution because there's an audience.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   Correct.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.200]   But I got no product, except for, well, I got my "How to Engineer Your Life" e-book,
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   and then I've got a book.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.680]   And other than that, I'm not selling anything, really.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.320]   I think, by the way, I was doing an episode about how to have business ideas recently.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:14.800]   And I think that going to, well, we call you an influencer, a thought leader, with solid
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.440]   operational business plans to responsibly capitalize on their distribution is such a
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   cool idea.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.720]   So, for example, in my case, I could imagine a world like I have group coaching experience
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.600]   where I could find a way to get on your calendar and say, "Hey, Sam, would you consider a joint
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.480]   venture for six months where here's how we would address your audience?"
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   We'd walk through it.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.600]   I have my whole team involved, and we'd responsibly walk your readers through financial training
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.100]   in a group setting.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.280]   And you would be able to watch it in these ways, and here would be the revenue split
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280]   for that.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.320]   I feel like that is, especially for creators who mostly want to build out what they're
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.280]   really good at, their work, having an operational partner that could come in and responsibly
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.200]   monetize the audience, I think, is a great business idea.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.440]   In terms of product people, you asked earlier, "Why are our products so random?"
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.560]   It's because I think something about the literature we were reading at the time, it made us understand
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:21.360]   that in this new world, the demand part was going to be where the winners became the winners.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.160]   And also, for us, it was a new opportunity.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.760]   In the good old days, you had to have a rent place on Main Street.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:35.240]   Well, now, with Google Search, you could have the equivalent of the nicest real estate for
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.720]   just hard work.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:44.060]   And that, as young kids with no money, was a very obvious opportunity.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:50.560]   So when we saw something like valet parking products, which we estimated to be worth...
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:57.800]   It's like having the storefront on the corner of Main Street, because it's a multimillion
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.400]   dollar industry, well, we could have that for free.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.680]   And so that's why we did it.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.640]   It wasn't because we were passionate about parking products.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.120]   It was because we were passionate about whatever we could own the best real estate for.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.240]   That totally makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.580]   And especially post-pandemic, with a business that can't be shut down, having an online
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.680]   business is even more valuable, more lucrative.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.360]   So I guess my question is, why don't more people do this?
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.440]   Why don't more people think about the online business world instead of just going to a
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.280]   day job where they make $50,000 a year out of college and then just grind it out for
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.080]   the next 20 years or 30 years?
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   That's funny.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.040]   It was the same question we were asking at that pool in Bali.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.000]   Why does everybody want to come?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.520]   I remember asking that question.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.040]   And the answer that I got from my friend David McKeegan, who ended up building one of the
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.980]   businesses I admire the most.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.560]   It's called Greenback Tax Services.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.600]   And what he does is taxes for expats in a productized level.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.920]   They have really made an incredible business out of this.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.240]   And he turned to me and he said, the reason is, is because it's going to take 1,000 days
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.040]   of effort where you're making less than what you'd make at your professional job.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.840]   And he says, I just don't think that people are willing to go through those 1,000 days.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.240]   And I since just ripped the idea off from him and I just went around and writing about
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   it and it seems to really resonate with a lot of entrepreneurs because a lot of us remember
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.880]   fondly that being broke to do this.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:39.680]   I just don't think people want to be that broke to build cat furniture or parking products
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.120]   or to write blogs on the internet and to be mocked and derided by your former colleagues
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   and your family.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   Oh, man.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   Man, you're bringing back all these memories I had.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   I was totally mocked.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.720]   I mean, my parents were not – I mean, they were – support is not the word I'd use
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   but they were great.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   But like –
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   I mean, they thought I should have stayed in my job which I think is decent advice from
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.920]   parents but I think that's a journey that's for people who are willing to take that risk,
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   I guess.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.280]   I think we mostly optimize for safety, stability.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.740]   We invest in index funds instead of taking concentrated home run bets.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.800]   But as a result, you end up just kind of average, average life which is fine.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.640]   If you have no regrets, then I guess that's fine.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.800]   But I resonated with A Thousand Days because I started Financial Samurai in July 2009 and
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.720]   I didn't leave my day job until what, May, April, May 2012.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.160]   I remember when you left.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.360]   It was really scary times but I mean that's almost three years of just kind of grinding
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.360]   it and just writing what I wanted until I felt confidence.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.440]   But it was really that severance package that gave me the confidence to say, "Oh, do or
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   die.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   Let's do it."
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:01.600]   So I hope more listeners think about entrepreneurship not as such a scary, impossible thing but
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.120]   something you can actually do on the side before you go to your day job or after your
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.360]   day job because you never know what could happen.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.080]   And clearly you, Dan, have crushed it and have continued to do what you're doing.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.960]   And I think it's way better now than can you imagine still being whatever you were doing
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.000]   at your day job making now maybe $160,000 a year?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.020]   I remember my business partner, we were having dinner last night after a bike ride and we're
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.920]   all sitting around a bunch of founders and he's like, "Sometimes I wake up and I pinch
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   myself.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   I haven't gone to a job for 20 years."
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:40.200]   Yeah, jobs were hard for us, I think, emotionally.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   It was hard for me.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   I don't know why.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.080]   It was hard for me to feel nervous about getting a dentist appointment.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.280]   There was some of these small indignities.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   I couldn't…
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.440]   I had to ask for permission to kind of be somewhere.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   As an adult now.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   I feel guilty about it.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.200]   Yeah, and it wasn't even necessarily about the money or not having more than three weeks
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   vacation or two.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.440]   It was more those small indignities about my day-to-day life that became untenable for
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   me.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.920]   But I do like your advice a lot about finding parlays and sticking in your day job as long
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.040]   as possible because there's…
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.960]   By definition, you're making…
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.560]   You're a profitable business if you have a job.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.040]   And so really digging into how you can be better at your career, how you can have a
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.360]   side hustle, how your career could support you in your next…
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.640]   And keeping the cash flow going.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.720]   So I think having a mind to entrepreneurship and not just cutting the cord is a better
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   strategy generally.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.040]   So tell me, you were in Asia for a long time.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.960]   And when did you decide to come back to America and why?
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.040]   Well, one of the simple insights that your writing recognizes that not a lot of financial
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.680]   writers say is you talk about relative wealth.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.700]   And so one of the cool things if you do have a writing or podcasting or creative project,
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:04.200]   you can just move to Chiang Mai and you'll have a hard time spending more than $3,000
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.600]   a month and living a good lifestyle.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.760]   And all of a sudden, you're relatively wealthy.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.280]   Very wealthy.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.040]   And so that's a nice little hack if what you want to do is free up your time and you
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.320]   have some savings or a smaller cash flow.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.240]   Or that would be the reason to get that one client that's paying you stress-free $3,000
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.860]   a month to do what you do at high stress for your job right now six days a week.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.820]   You can move to a place like Chiang Mai and leverage those other four days.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:41.620]   So I ended up, I think what happened for me was I was doing better financially.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.260]   And a lot of places in Asia are developing and have frustrations that come along with
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.260]   living there.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.220]   And at first, it's an adventure.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.820]   But then it becomes frustrating.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:55.460]   And so I thought, I went to a few conferences in Barcelona and different places in Europe.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.300]   We started another business where we started pulling together founders at events.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.380]   So I got to see all these new cities.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.180]   And I remember the first time I came to Barcelona, you know how when you have an image in your
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.100]   head of a place and then you go there, and it can be a lot different.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.900]   Sometimes people think Tokyo is going to be a bunch of robots running around.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.980]   And then you see a bunch of hipsters.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.820]   It's more subdued in terms of maybe the branding.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.180]   And for me, Barcelona's brand was so understated at the time.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.780]   When I got there, I was really blown away by how beautiful it was and how close to nature
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   it was.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   And so I thought, well, I can afford it.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.740]   I'll move to Europe now.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.100]   I did that for about three or four years.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.780]   And when the pandemic hit, I finally decided that was time to return back to America.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.260]   I love Barcelona.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.820]   It's an unbelievable place.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.380]   Good nightlife, good food.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.820]   I remember going to Barcelona, then Mallorca.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.380]   People love life in Europe.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.980]   Compared to the United States, people really live it up.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.180]   Maybe that's why the unemployment rate is so much higher, taxes are so much higher,
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.000]   and there's less innovation out of Europe.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.060]   But strategically, making your money in America and then moving to Europe is a good plan,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.740]   I think, for a lot of people.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.060]   If you have a hustle mindset and you want to get something off the ground, America and
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.540]   Asia are better places.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.140]   But if you want to enjoy your money, the fruits of your labor, Europe is a better place.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.940]   If you're the one person there that's hustling in Europe, you're swimming upstream a little
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.500]   bit because the whole point is to enjoy yourself, or at least a lot of places in Southern Europe
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   that I hang out in.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.020]   So, yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.620]   Travel has never left that passion for travel.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.140]   So for example, my partner and I, we're taking off here in a few weeks.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:46.380]   We're going to be going to Paris, to London, to Barcelona, to the mountains, to Italy,
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.940]   to New York, to ... It sounds exhausting, doesn't it?
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.500]   Then we'll be going to Bangkok.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.020]   Then we'll be going to Osaka.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.780]   So the whole rest of half our year is a bit of a digital nomad party, so to speak, because
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.620]   we'll probably be building a family here in the next year.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.300]   So it's kind of just that last hurrah.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.260]   Go around, visit as many friends as possible.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.740]   Go to as many cool conferences as possible, and to bring my bike, too.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:21.380]   So yeah, that's, for me, my version of enjoying what we've built is being able to ... I love
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.100]   taking a few days off and then opening up my laptop in Paris and genuinely working,
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.980]   like working on the business for a few days, but also being able to meet people there and
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.640]   enjoy a different sort of life.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.020]   It's pretty exciting for me still.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:41.660]   No, it's the magical lifestyle that I dreamt about, but I was stuck in the grind and banking,
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.260]   and then I had kids in 2017.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.980]   So it's really like if you have the opportunity to travel and do something and go on an adventure,
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.020]   go take it, because I don't think you'll ever regret it.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.340]   No, but I don't think you'll ever regret having kids, too.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.140]   Kids to me is like higher up on the achievement level.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.620]   Anybody can get a plane ticket, but ...
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.620]   That's true.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.620]   Yeah, it's not easy having kids.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.420]   I mean, I don't want to take it for granted that we have kids, but I'm kind of in a holding
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.540]   pattern now where I got to wait until my kids are old enough, so the youngest one is only
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.060]   three and a half, so maybe when she's five and a half, then we can go travel.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.660]   So then that way she can sleep better and remember her travels.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.700]   Yeah, my best friend and business partner, his son is five and a half, and he knows that
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.940]   he's going to Barcelona in a few weeks.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.540]   I just called him the other day and we were talking about it.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.980]   And he goes to a different school there, and he has different kind of ways to play there.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.600]   And one of the things that I think is interesting when you leave America with kids is how much
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.100]   more kid-friendly a lot of other societies are around the world.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.620]   Strangers will interact with children.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.980]   There's safer places to play.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:54.500]   There's sort of spaces where parents maybe have some food and drinks while there's like
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.420]   a communal playground where there's a bunch of restaurants surrounding it.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.100]   It's really kid-friendly in Europe and in Asia, I found, relative to America.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.980]   That's actually good to know.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.580]   A lot of my friends who are parents, they really look forward to that time of year when
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.300]   they go abroad for a few months.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.620]   And it's just a lot easier to have kids in a lot of these cities that are more walkable
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.380]   and less traffic and things like that.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:32.540]   Did you experience any reverse back to America besides the kids thing or what you noticed?
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.820]   Reverse culture shock.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.500]   I think the most shocking thing about America is how expensive it is.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.220]   There are certain things that are very good value in America, maybe square footage, clean
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.620]   air, recreational, national parks, stuff like that.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:55.780]   But a lot of the services, luxury stuff, it's a really sticker shock.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.420]   My little heuristic I've been rolling with is in order to have consumer freedom, I feel
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.740]   like you need to be making four times what an average professional would make in wherever
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.740]   country you're at.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.540]   I've been going around doing that math.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.420]   And for here in Austin, Texas, you have to make over $200,000 a year, I think, to just
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:22.100]   basically have the sort of freedom that I've been working for.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.380]   So that's the first shock.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:30.780]   But honestly, I think a lot of the culture shock stuff for me was in my head.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.140]   Maybe I was trying to figure out who I was and build an identity for myself.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:42.980]   And when you come back to go to a wedding or to do a family responsibility or a conference
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.820]   or something, you think, "Man, I worked so hard to get free from all of this."
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.860]   I think a lot of that was really in my own head, Sam.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.300]   So no, not really.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.700]   Sticker shock, not culture shock.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.780]   Sticker shock, not culture shock.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   Got it.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.180]   Well, it seems like you're still going to have the best of both worlds.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:07.260]   You're going to go on your lounge like maybe family is in the works.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.180]   Are you excited about that new stage?
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.180]   Absolutely.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.180]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:22.340]   Yeah, I'm thankful I was able to build the business in a way that I think is sustainable
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.220]   and has longevity.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.860]   And also, yeah, travel and go on a bunch of adventures.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.660]   I'm ready to go on the big adventure.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.400]   The big 18-year-plus lifetime adventure.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.980]   So what is your latest business now and how can listeners follow you and keep in touch
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.860]   and see what you're up to?
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:47.340]   Yeah, I mean, we've built, much like you, we have a podcast called Tropical MBA and
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.660]   essentially that's our distribution.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:55.540]   And so every few years we sort of ask ourselves, "Well, what does the audience want?"
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:01.700]   It started with events and then it became a private forum.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.080]   And our most recent, oh, then it became recruiting services and hiring services.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.540]   So we started providing those to the audience.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:13.020]   And we would bring in division heads, performer recruiting professionals to run those different
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.020]   divisions.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.620]   And our most recent one is seven and eight figure founders.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.380]   They want a cool kids table.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.880]   They want a cool kids lunch table.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.980]   They want their own private community and mastermind where they know that when they
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.780]   go to an event or show up to a mastermind call that everyone has built wealth from their
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.820]   own location independent business.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.480]   And so we recently started this new community and we've got over a hundred applications
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.380]   for it and it's been going great.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.360]   So it's been fun to pick up the phone and speak with people with much larger businesses
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.260]   than our own that are seeking to connect with each other.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.980]   So it's essentially like a networking and mastermind business.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   So it's been a fun and exciting year.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.660]   That's great, Dan.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.140]   Well, thanks so much for chatting with me for this past half hour.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.600]   It's been great seeing your journey and I'm really excited for your next journey.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.260]   Being a dad is probably, I think, harder than being an entrepreneur, especially harder than
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.200]   being a day job employee.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.500]   So best of luck to you and if you have any questions or want any advice, just shoot me
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.420]   an email.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.940]   I will do so on that, Sam.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.220]   And to all the respect in the world for what you've built, I've been following since day
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.220]   one.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.020]   And I think you're an incredibly unique voice in this space and we appreciate it.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   Thank you.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   Cool, man.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.020]   Thank you.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.020]   Let's see.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.340]   Cool, man.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.840]   Thank you.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   Thanks for watching!
