[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   So many of the ways God is sovereignly directing our lives are intangible,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   or they are simply imperceivable to us.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   But that's not always the case.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   There's one way God sovereignly directs our lives that is very tangible and concrete,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   as John Piper explained in his recent sermon on Psalm 16, titled,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "The Path to Full and Lasting Pleasure."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Here's what Pastor John said on Psalm 16, verse 7.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   He is our treasure, and now we're going to see that he is our counselor.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Verse 7. He goes one step further in exalting in what God is for him.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   God is not only refuge, treasure, sovereign, but now he's counselor.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now that's not a small add-on.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And the reason I say it's not a small or insignificant add-on to refuge, sovereign, and treasure
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   is because trusting God as your counselor affects how you experience God as your refuge
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and as your treasure and as your sovereign.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Let me just illustrate what I mean by that.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   God is a refuge in part by the way he counsels us.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   God's being a refuge for you is not automatic.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's not mechanical.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It's not like you pay zero attention to his word and his counsel,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and you simply find yourself safe.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   If you find yourself in danger, danger of harm, danger of a sin,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   danger of some absolutely foolish way of life, and God comes to you with his counsel,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   he's telling you how to find refuge.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Don't go there. Don't do that.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So his counsel is the means of his becoming refuge for you.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   This is dynamic. This is interactive.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   God's word are his counsels to us, and his word is the path of life, not death,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   the path of safety, not destruction, and therefore he's becoming a refuge for us
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   all the time as he speaks to us.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Or treasure.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   How does his being a treasure for us relate to his being a counselor for us?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Well, because you don't only treasure God because of his character,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   righteous and just and true and gracious and loving and wise.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   You also treasure him because of his teachings, his words.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Remember the soldiers who came back, and they said, "Why didn't you bring Jesus?"
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And the soldiers said, "Nobody speaks like this man."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   His disciples were constantly jaw-dropping at the kinds of things he said.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   His counsels were stunningly satisfying and beautiful.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So he's our treasure, not only in the way he is, but the way he talks to us.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so being our counselor intersects with his being our treasure.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And the same thing is true about his sovereignty.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   God is sovereign over you.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Sometimes in spite of you, he just cuts you off at some stupid direction
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   you're going and you didn't approve of it at all, and he rescues you.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Other times he exercises his authority and sovereignty through his counsel to you.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   God uses means as well as acting sovereignly apart from means.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So the first seven verses are first, "Preserve me, O God.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Preserve me, O God."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And then four declarations and exaltations.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "You're my refuge, my safe place. You're my sovereign, my Lord.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You hold my lot, and you are my treasure supreme.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I have no good apart from you, and you're my counselor."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Now, what in the flow of that worship happens to his petition?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   When you get to verse eight, "I have set the Lord always before me."
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   That's what he's been doing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "Because he is at my right hand, this refuge, this sovereign, this treasure,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   this counselor, because he's at my right hand, I shall not be shaken."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That's not a request anymore. That's an affirmation.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So the way I understand verses one through eight is that what begins as an aching longing,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "Preserve me, O God," ends with, "I will not be shaken.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I will be preserved. I will be kept. He will not let me be lost."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And the pathway from the petition, aching and longing, to the assertion and the affirmation
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   and the confidence is heralding and exalting in what God is for us.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I would simply commend to you that way of praying.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Because almost all my beginnings in prayer begin the way his does.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I seldom begin a worship service or a time of prayer in solitude red hot for God.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Totally confident. This is going to go well. This day, he's in charge.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It's going to go right. He'll give me his guidance.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   My prayers don't begin that way. They begin, "Help!"
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Which is the way he began, right? "Preserve me, O God."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then what do you do? You stop and wait for confidence to happen?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   No. You do what he did. You do what he did.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You declare. You can do it alone. You can do it in a small group.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You can do it as you sing. You declare what he is for you.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And you exalt in what he is for you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And after you do that through safe refuge and highest treasure and sovereign Lord
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   and trusted counselor, confidence is rising.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That's the way the psalm flows, it seems to me.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Beautiful. We are going to return tomorrow with a really important question that Christians face,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   which is how angry should we be about cultural sins like abortion
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and the Planned Parenthood videos that we see online?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   We don't want to become raving lunatics.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   What we certainly cannot be content is mute observers of such public injustice.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So how should we vent our anger in a way that is helpful for our friends to see?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I'll ask John Piper that question tomorrow.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
