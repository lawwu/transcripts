[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.460]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.540]   The BCS Pastors Conference finishes up today
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.720]   here on Wednesday, and as I mentioned last time,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.020]   earlier in January, Pastor John traveled to Louisville
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.980]   to speak at the annual cross conference,
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.820]   and one of the sessions was a panel discussion
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.900]   hosted by David Platt, and he was joined with Pastor John
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.260]   and International Evangelist Max Stiles
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.860]   and Pastors Thabiti Anyewabwile and Kevin DeYoung.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.700]   There was a second clip I wanted to share on this podcast,
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.300]   and on this one, the topic is the place of the local church
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.260]   in global missions, and that connection
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.100]   is really important to get this.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.220]   And here's David Platt himself talking about
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.140]   one of the major themes behind the cross conference.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.980]   - One other that's a big emphasis among us
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860]   and anybody else who you'll see on the stage
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.180]   is the role, central role of the local church
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.480]   in the Great Commission.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.260]   So these are pastors have served as pastor,
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.900]   everybody who's come up here is either pastoring a church,
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.140]   is part of church planting specifically,
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260]   so we don't see the Great Commission
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.220]   disconnected from the church.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.900]   It's a mission given to the church.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.220]   Mac, you spoke on that earlier today.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.540]   Can you summarize in a minute or two
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.180]   just what you shared earlier today
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.740]   about the role of the local church?
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.620]   - Yeah, the local church is the embassy of God
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   on earth, the platform for which the Lord God advances
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.540]   evangelism, discipleship, and mission.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.580]   We can't do missions without the church.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.260]   I didn't always believe that,
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.900]   I didn't always understand that,
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.920]   but I actually went to the Arabian Peninsula
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.340]   to do student ministry, but by God's great grace,
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.880]   we saw many people come to faith,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.820]   many students come to faith,
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.260]   and there was not really a local healthy church
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.140]   for them to go to, and suddenly we realized,
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.860]   wait a second, we've gotta think about this.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.020]   The church is critical.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.740]   We can't just give lip service to the church.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.060]   The church is kind of the aim of missions in one sense,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.220]   and so we rolled up our sleeves,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.220]   we got involved in a local ex-pat church,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.540]   English speaking church, but revitalized it
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.660]   in some powerful ways.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660]   It's a vibrant, gospel-centered, cross-focused church today
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.460]   that has partnered with the student ministry
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.500]   such that there has been power as the result
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.900]   of being in a church, a local, healthy,
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.540]   vibrant, gospel-centered church,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.620]   and reaching out into unreached people groups.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.380]   So the main thing I want people to hear
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.740]   is don't ever let a missionary tell you,
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.260]   don't get involved in the local church,
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.140]   in a city that you go to as a missionary
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.340]   because it will take you away from your ministry,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.740]   whatever that means.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.540]   Don't let people tell you that.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.980]   God loves his bride.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.820]   They're often misshapen, they're often odd,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.340]   but he loves his bride, and you should love his bride too.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.540]   And pursue helping the church become vibrant
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.020]   if they're not, get plugged into the local, healthy churches
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.620]   if you become missionaries and workers overseas.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.840]   Take hold of God's love for the church
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.700]   because it empowers us in ministry.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.780]   God blesses those who love his church
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.980]   and are involved in it, help strengthen it,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.220]   and help it grow.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.700]   - Let me shift a little bit to something
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.620]   that's been mentioned already a couple times from stage,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.060]   including this conversation.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.180]   Do you all suspect as you pray for what will happen
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.160]   over the next few days that 7,000 plus people
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.160]   will leave here and move to another country as a missionary?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   And so do you suspect that's gonna happen,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.420]   or do you think there are other ways
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.980]   God might lead people to play a part in this picture?
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.060]   So we've talked about going and sending.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.500]   Who wants to give some clarity?
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.800]   - Yeah, they can do that.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.820]   We can have 7,500 go.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.740]   - Okay, that's great.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.820]   So glad we answered that.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.660]   But.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.540]   - I think we need clarity even in front of that question,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.660]   maybe you're getting at it, but what is a missionary?
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.660]   'Cause many folks would say, you're all missionaries,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.700]   and put it on the door as you leave here,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.560]   go out into your mission field,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   and we're working with a narrower definition,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.160]   not at all to minimize the 10 million good things we do
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.000]   in the name of Christ, but we're thinking of missionaries
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   as those who are sent from one place to another,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   we see in scripture involving the crossing
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.080]   of some sort of barriers or cultures,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.560]   with the purpose of speaking the name of Christ,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.440]   planting and nurturing healthy churches.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.920]   Something like that would be what we see,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.760]   and a text that I go to is Acts chapter 14,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.240]   I won't read it to you, but you can go to the end
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.920]   where Paul is sort of giving, I think,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.200]   his missionary report to the church in Antioch,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.360]   and right above that, it gives a summary
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.040]   of what he does in those trips to Derbe and Lystra
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.360]   and around the Mediterranean,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.300]   and he's doing those three things,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.480]   sharing the gospel, making disciples,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.980]   planting churches, and strengthening churches
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.260]   as he's sent to places to do that.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.880]   So, as a very good recent book came out,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   "When Missions is Everything,"
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.480]   and that's a play on an old line,
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.520]   but when missions is everything,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.880]   it ends up that missions is nothing.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.960]   So we want to specify not every good thing you do
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.000]   in the name of Christ is what we mean by missions.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.920]   - But that definition you just gave won't work,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   because it applies to all American church planters,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   doesn't it?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.100]   - Well, for crossing cultures?
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.260]   - That wasn't one of the three.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.780]   - Well, that was at the front end, I said,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.300]   of being sent across cultures for those three purposes.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.060]   - To make disciples.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.760]   - Here's a better text.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.380]   [audience laughing]
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.780]   - They're all inspired, John.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.060]   - Don't you love that moment when John Piper says,
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.900]   "Won't work."
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.940]   - They don't all say the same thing.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.060]   [audience laughing]
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.340]   So, the question you have to ask is,
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.720]   in every church, should there be somebody like Paul,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.520]   not just somebody like Timothy?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.720]   Paul, in Romans 15, said,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   "I have completed the gospel from Jerusalem to Albania.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.080]   "I've completed it.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.740]   "I have no more room for work here."
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.820]   That's ridiculous.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.320]   There's tens of thousands of unbelievers there,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.360]   because he told Timothy to go do the work of an evangelist,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.920]   and he's leaving for Spain.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.440]   Now, who is he?
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.720]   Who is Paul?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.520]   Because he's got no room for work here.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.880]   Timothy, you got lots of room for work here.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.700]   Get it done.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.960]   Do evangelism.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.580]   Go plant churches among all those people like you.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.160]   I'm going to Spain because I'm called to something different.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.080]   Now, that's what, whatever you call that person,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.600]   that's what I want about 800 of you to be.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.320]   That's my number out of my head.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   You said, "Do we want 7,000?"
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.640]   Paul did not, because when he wrote to Rome,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.840]   he didn't ask them all to go with him to Spain.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   He asked them to send him,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.100]   and if he thought everybody should be
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.480]   a frontier-type missionary, he would have said,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.840]   "No, let's all leave Rome.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.960]   "It's evangelized, and go to Spain."
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.760]   So, I think that's included in your first qualification,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.720]   to cross a culture, or go to unreached.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   It's not just crossing a culture.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.800]   These frontier-types or pioneer-types missionaries
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.200]   are those who want to go someplace
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.160]   where Christ isn't named, and put a stake in the ground,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.580]   and herald his name, and gather disciples,
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.880]   and then do that amazing thing of forming churches.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.640]   And I just want to underline that church issue,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   because most of you are not heavily engaged
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   churchmen and churchwomen, and you need to be.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.040]   Spend the next years becoming churchmen and churchwomen,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.760]   meaning you get it.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.160]   You understand what elders are, or deacons are,
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.560]   what pastors do, what the role of women are,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.840]   what the role of men are, what the role of evangelism,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.520]   what the role of prayer is, how a church works.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.760]   Because when you go to an unreached people,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.580]   and they have nothing, nothing, what are you gonna build?
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.800]   What are you going to build, if you don't have any idea
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.080]   of how churches function when they're healthy?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.200]   - Such a good word.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.020]   Global missions in the local church
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.960]   are linked up in the plan of God.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.320]   I love this cross-conference conviction.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.220]   I love how these men articulated here.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.020]   The BCS Pastors Conference wraps up today
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.160]   here in Minneapolis.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   So does a very busy January for Pastor John.
