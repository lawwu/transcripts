[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   - Welcome back on this Monday.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.280]   Today we have a wonderful ministry question
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.320]   on preaching right in your wheelhouse, Pastor John.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840]   Young pastor writes in to ask you this, quote,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.760]   "Hello, Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.460]   "I listen every time a new episode is released,
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.720]   "and I'm thankful for the impact
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.540]   "that your biblical insights have made on my life.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.820]   "My question for you is about expository preaching
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.980]   "and its place in student ministry.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.860]   "I am the student pastor at my church.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.700]   "Responsible for sixth through 12th grade ministry.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.100]   "Whenever we gather for our youth worship time
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400]   "on Wednesday nights, I typically preach
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.780]   "through books of the Bible in an expositional way.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780]   "I try my best to apply the text to them
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.100]   "in ways that they can understand.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.880]   "However, I sometimes question whether I should
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.100]   "preach expository sermons to the students
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.400]   "because I don't believe it's a common practice
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.780]   "in youth ministries.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.460]   "I love God's word and want my students
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.340]   "to come to love God's word as well,
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.800]   "but should I teach to my students
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.100]   "in a way that is more application focused?
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500]   "I would appreciate your thoughts on this.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.340]   "Thank you."
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.180]   - Well, I have endless thoughts about preaching.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.380]   (both laughing)
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.620]   - Yes.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.740]   - I could just go on and on and on.
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.960]   I love preaching.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.440]   I believe God has appointed preaching
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.060]   to be part of the gathered worship of His church
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.980]   on the Lord's day especially,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.100]   and I think all of it, all the time,
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.720]   should be based on and saturated with scripture.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.360]   That's what preaching is.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   It is a God-ordained way of saving sinners
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.300]   and sustaining and growing saints.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.460]   I think it's relevant for old people,
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.820]   middle-aged people, young people, children.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.860]   So I'm thrilled that our young pastor friend
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.320]   is in a church and leading a youth group
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.580]   where he is doing exposition.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580]   So here are my, I originally had in my head
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.060]   a whole lot of thoughts, but I boiled it down to three.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.500]   So here are my three thoughts
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.360]   I can squeeze into our few minutes together.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.100]   Number one, as you unfold the meaning
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.260]   of particular biblical texts,
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   be sure to stress what I call the reality factor.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.100]   Now, you don't need to use that phrase.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.620]   That's my phrase, but here's what I mean.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.540]   Some years ago, it hit me when I realized
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.220]   that it is possible to do a great deal
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   of explaining how the thought of the text actually flows
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.700]   and how the words and clauses relate to each other
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.780]   without actually dealing with the reality
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.180]   of what the words are trying to communicate.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.760]   It just clobbered me that we can do this.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.140]   We can stay at the surface of grammar
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.960]   and not get to reality.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.780]   For example, in Philippians 2.12, it says,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.060]   "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.900]   for God is the one who is at work in you,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.180]   both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.460]   Now, suppose in your exposition,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.580]   you point out to the students
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.100]   that the first clause is an imperative, command.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.140]   Work out your salvation.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.500]   And the second clause is not a command,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.400]   but an indicative, a statement of fact.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.900]   God is at work in you, to will and to work.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.660]   And then you draw attention to the connection
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.700]   between those two clauses with the word for,
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.100]   and you point out that the second clause,
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   the statement, God is working, is the basis or the ground.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.420]   That's what for means, or the motive for the first clause,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.100]   the command, work out your salvation.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.020]   And maybe you even go further and you say,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.860]   this is typical in the New Testament,
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.340]   that indicatives ground imperatives,
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.640]   and then you stop, end of exposition.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.500]   Well, the problem is, stopping there,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.060]   is that we haven't even touched the reality
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.920]   behind the clauses and their logical connection
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.520]   until we see how does this work in life?
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   Why does it work that I work out my salvation
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.240]   because Christ is at work in me, or God is at work in me?
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   There's a vast difference between words and clauses
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.280]   on the one hand, and the realities they reveal
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.320]   on the other hand.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.800]   And here you can see, this just blows people away
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.600]   when I pointed out, at least some people
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.700]   who have particular ideas about preaching,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.140]   how artificial it is in the distinction
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.000]   between exposition and application.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.060]   Let me say that again, how artificial it is
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.080]   to distinguish between exposition and application,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   because we're not really doing exposition of the reality
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.940]   behind the words until we are dealing with real life,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.520]   and telling how it works.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.400]   What will it be like this afternoon?
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.320]   So the question is at 10 o'clock tonight,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.840]   after these students are at home,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   having heard this exposition,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.900]   they're at home now in their bedroom,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.300]   with their computer, or with their family in the den,
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.980]   what will it look like for these students
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.620]   to work out their salvation?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.480]   What is that reality like?
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.800]   What will it feel like for them to experience
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.220]   the reality of God working in them?
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.060]   Do they have any sense at all what that it's talking about?
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.220]   What's the reality?
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.080]   How does it feel?
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.860]   How does it work?
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.360]   And how will they make the connection
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.080]   between those experiences of God working in them
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   and their working?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.800]   We really don't know what this text means
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   until we can explain not just the words,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.460]   clauses, logic, grammar,
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.280]   but the realities tonight at 10 o'clock in the bedroom,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.860]   in the kitchen, how it works in people's lives.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.080]   That requires a huge effort on the part of the preacher,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.240]   because he's now working at two levels,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.000]   the level of words and grammar and logic,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.640]   we call that the text,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.180]   and the effort to explain how the parts
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.440]   of the text fit together.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.740]   And on the other level,
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.600]   what realities is this author with these words
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.000]   and this grammar and this logic?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.760]   What realities is he trying to communicate
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.100]   to my mind and my heart and my hands?
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.480]   Language and reality, the two levels,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.520]   and both are absolutely crucial.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.040]   You can't do a shortcut around the grammar,
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.080]   around the logic, around the words,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.120]   but if you stop there,
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   you haven't done the kind of exposition needs to be done.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.200]   It is real head work.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.820]   It is real heart work,
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   but the payoff for the students will be huge.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.680]   So that's my first suggestion.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.640]   Deal with the reality factor,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.520]   as well as the text factor.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.780]   Your students will love it,
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.600]   because it will touch their lives, their reality.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   Number two, in your exposition through texts,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   take doctrinal depth tours,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.820]   not doctrinal detours,
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.040]   but doctrinal depth tours.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.440]   Now, I just made that up.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.320]   I have never in the history of the world said that before.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.480]   This is my new term, and here's what I mean.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.680]   I mean is that preaching that moves through texts
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.820]   without doctrinal depth tours,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.840]   they're like detours, but they're depth tours,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.360]   'cause you're not going away from where you should go.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.420]   That's what a detour is.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.400]   You go away and you wish you didn't have to go,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.880]   but a depth tour, you wanna go on this road.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.760]   So this will build doctrinally strong people.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.880]   And without it, I just don't know how you can build
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.080]   doctrinally strong youth group,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.560]   doctrinally strong people.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.580]   What I mean by that is people, youth group,
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.080]   who have a clear, deeply rooted understanding
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   of really important biblical doctrines.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.720]   Now, you can't do everything as a youth pastor.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.360]   You're working in tandem with other groups
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.040]   and worship services and sermons and lessons and classes
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   in your church and maybe even in the home
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.200]   and in the school.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.880]   But I mean doctrines like God's sovereignty,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.720]   God's holiness, God's grace, God's justice,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.680]   the deity and humanity of Christ,
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.120]   the deity and personhood of the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.040]   the nature of sin, both as action and disease of the heart,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.560]   the nature of redemption and propitiation and regeneration,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.120]   calling, faith, justification, sanctification,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.920]   walking by the Spirit, perseverance of the saints,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.600]   the nature of the church, what happens when you die,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.280]   the second coming, eternal life, new heavens and new earth.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.400]   If a young person studies texts of scripture
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.040]   without ever taking doctrinal depth tours,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.680]   he's like a person who lines up all the pieces
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.800]   of a jigsaw puzzle but never puts them together
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.000]   to see the beauty of the picture that they make.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.440]   But in fact, you can be pretty proud
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.760]   of putting those pieces in line.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.160]   It could look, my pieces are all lined up.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.800]   They might even recite the entire first chapter
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.880]   of Ephesians by heart and never have paused
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.720]   to do a detour into the doctrine of election.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.480]   But it's the totality of the big picture
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.120]   that holds person, isn't it?
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   It's the picture that holds, takes hold of a 16-year-old
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.360]   and keeps them for 60 years, holds them for a lifetime.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   Who God is, what he's doing, how did Christ save sinners?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   How does the Christian life work?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.440]   Where's it all heading?
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.240]   Now, there are different ways to do this.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   You can do an expository series of messages through text
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.000]   and then do a doctrinal series separately.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.360]   I'm not at all opposed to topical messages like that.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.280]   Like we're gonna do five weeks, kids,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.760]   on election and predestination.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.960]   And we're gonna do five weeks on sin and what it is,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.760]   what kind of disease do you have in your heart and so on.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.800]   I'm not at all opposed to those kinds of things
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.680]   because they're all expository,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.200]   meaning if I'm gonna explain anything,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   it's gonna be exposition of the scripture
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.840]   is where my explanations come from.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   Or you can take these doctrinal depth tours
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.120]   that I'm suggesting within the time of exposition.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   So 15 minutes, say, of your 30-minute message
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.680]   might be devoted to painting the big doctrinal reality
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.760]   behind one word in your text, like justification.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.600]   It's not either or, you can mix it up in various ways.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.880]   I think students love to see
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.880]   how reality actually fits together, really fits together.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.220]   And they love to see how texts actually work.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.160]   So some combination of exposition of texts
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   where they get their nose in the grammar
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.840]   and efforts to build their doctrinal knowledge,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.480]   both of these are crucial.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.000]   And then last thing I would say, number three,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.540]   is if your students hear good preaching on Sunday morning,
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.440]   I would probably not try to turn
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   the Wednesday evening teaching time into another sermon.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.880]   I would create a more interactive,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.080]   Socratic method of teaching, probably.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.760]   Now you know your situation better than I do,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.520]   but this is what I would do if I were the youth minister
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.140]   and I had a good pastor who's doing real preaching
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.320]   on Sunday, I would probably not try to do the same thing
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.600]   on Wednesday, but train these students
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   how to look at the text, look at the book,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   and how to ask really good thought questions
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.960]   because questions are the key to understanding.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.320]   Lots of times people hear me say a participatory
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   or interactive and they think,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.720]   "Oh, I've been in those kinds of groups.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.560]   Everybody shares their ignorance."
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.240]   All what I mean, I mean, I teach like this generally.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.920]   I stay in control.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.800]   I'm asking the questions, right?
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.740]   And if students ask stupid questions,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.360]   then you delicately and wisely,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.680]   you guide them towards good questions.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.040]   You don't let everybody just share their ignorance.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.800]   You know where you wanna take them
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   and you take them there by training them
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.760]   to get there themselves.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.120]   You're modeling how to pose really good questions
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.600]   about what you see in the text and getting them to look
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.360]   and think and speak and then correcting them
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.780]   so that they get better and better at reading their Bibles.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.460]   It is possible to do very serious exposition
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.680]   and doctrinal teaching this way.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.720]   You can do this Socratically.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.940]   And the key is really good questions, provocative questions.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.180]   I mean, I've been in so many groups where they say,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.260]   "Who said this?"
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.420]   And the students are looking at each other and saying,
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.860]   "That's the stupidest question.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.100]   It says, Peter said this.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.420]   Why is he asking me that?
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.540]   That is such a stupid question.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.420]   Who said this?
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.020]   Where are we in the text?"
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.420]   Those are not the kind of questions
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.020]   that get anybody excited about anything.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.340]   They have to be thought questions, hard thinking questions,
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.740]   questions that really have to pay off
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.860]   in textual understanding and real life experience.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.500]   So those are my three suggestions
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.660]   for handling the Word with your youth group.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.660]   Deal with the reality factor, take doctrinal depth tours,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.460]   and ask provocative thought questions.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.500]   And of course, a whole nother episode,
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.700]   soak it all in earnest prayer,
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.700]   because if God doesn't show up, then everything is in vain.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.180]   - Yeah, amen, sobering.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.620]   God must act for anything we do
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.340]   to bear eternally lasting fruit.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.340]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.620]   And for churches that don't preach exegetically
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.900]   on Sunday mornings, if that's a concern,
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.700]   see an old episode that we recorded titled,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.940]   "Is the 40-minute sermon passé?"
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.540]   Is the 40-minute sermon passé?
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.860]   That was APJ 118, on why discussions
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.140]   in the Socratic method are out of place
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.380]   in the Sunday morning preaching context.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.900]   Sermons are not just about learning.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.260]   The first aim of preaching, he says in this episode,
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.980]   "The first aim of preaching is not education,
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.900]   but encounter with the living God."
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.180]   Excellent episode to check out
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.420]   on the purpose of preaching APJ 118
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.900]   in the archive right now at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.060]   Thanks for joining us today.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.700]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.260]   We will see you back here on Thursday.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.300]   Thanks for listening.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   (upbeat music)
