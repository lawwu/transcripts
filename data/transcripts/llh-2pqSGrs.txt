[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   The following is a conversation with Peter Singer,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.200]   professor of bioethics at Princeton University,
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.280]   best known for his 1975 book, "Animal Liberation,"
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.240]   that makes an ethical case against eating meat.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.680]   He has written brilliantly from an ethical perspective
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.480]   on extreme poverty, euthanasia, human genetic selection,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720]   sports doping, the sale of kidneys,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.520]   and generally happiness, including in his books,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.000]   "Ethics in the Real World" and "The Life You Can Save."
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.560]   He was a key popularizer
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.360]   of the effective altruism movement
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.800]   and is generally considered
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.100]   one of the most influential philosophers in the world.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   Two sponsors, Cash App and Masterclass.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.880]   Please consider supporting the podcast
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.280]   by downloading Cash App and using code LEXPODCAST
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.960]   and signing up at masterclass.com/lex.

[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.120]   It really is the best way to support the podcast
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.480]   and the journey I'm on.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.920]   As you may know, I primarily eat a ketogenic
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.520]   or carnivore diet,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.400]   which means that most of my diet is made up of meat.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.480]   I do not hunt the food I eat, though one day I hope to.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.840]   I love fishing, for example.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   Fishing and eating the fish I catch
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440]   has always felt much more honest
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.460]   than participating in the supply chain of factory farming.
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.440]   From an ethics perspective,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.000]   this part of my life has always had a cloud over it.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.700]   It makes me think.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.960]   I've tried a few times in my life
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   to reduce the amount of meat I eat,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.280]   but for some reason, whatever the makeup of my body,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.120]   whatever the way I practice the dieting I have,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.040]   I get a lot of mental and physical energy
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.640]   and performance from eating meat.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000]   So both intellectually and physically,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.200]   it's a continued journey for me.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.220]   I return to Peter's work often
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.380]   to reevaluate the ethics
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.420]   of how I live this aspect of my life.
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.200]   Let me also say that you may be a vegan
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840]   or you may be a meat eater
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.440]   and may be upset by the words I say or Peter says,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.780]   but I ask for this podcast
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.080]   and other episodes of this podcast
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.280]   that you keep an open mind.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.680]   I may and probably will talk with people you disagree with.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.820]   Please try to really listen,
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.440]   especially to people you disagree with
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.840]   and give me and the world the gift
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.480]   of being a participant
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.840]   in a patient, intelligent, and nuanced discourse.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.660]   If your instinct and desire is to be a voice of mockery
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.600]   towards those you disagree with,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   please unsubscribe.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860]   My source of joy and inspiration here
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.880]   has been to be a part of a community
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   that thinks deeply and speaks with empathy and compassion.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.880]   That is what I hope to continue being a part of
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.200]   and I hope you join as well.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.560]   If you enjoy this podcast,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.940]   subscribe on YouTube,
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.360]   review it with Five Stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.840]   follow on Spotify,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240]   support on Patreon,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.920]   or connect with me on Twitter @LexFriedman.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.940]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.280]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.040]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.560]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.960]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.320]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.520]   with as little as $1.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.800]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.720]   let me mention that cryptocurrency
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.400]   in the context of the history of money is fascinating.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.520]   I recommend "A Scent of Money"
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.480]   as a great book on this history.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.160]   Debits and credits on ledgers
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.960]   started around 30,000 years ago.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.560]   The US dollar created over 200 years ago
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.080]   and the first decentralized cryptocurrency
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.740]   released just over 10 years ago.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.040]   So given that history,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.000]   cryptocurrency is still very much
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.720]   in its early days of development,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.160]   but it's still aiming to,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.280]   and just might,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.320]   redefine the nature of money.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.220]   So again, if you get Cash App
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.960]   from the App Store or Google Play
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.480]   and use the code LEXPODCAST,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.880]   you get $10.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   And Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   an organization that is helping to advance
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.180]   robotics and STEM education
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.880]   for young people around the world.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.440]   This show is sponsored by Masterclass.

[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.320]   When I first heard about Masterclass,
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.160]   I thought it was too good to be true.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   For $180 a year,

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   to list some of my favorites,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.960]   Chris Hadfield on space exploration,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.200]   and communication,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.420]   Will Wright, creator of SimCity and Sims on game design.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.880]   I promise I'll start streaming games at some point soon.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.840]   Carlos Santana on guitar,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.520]   Garry Kasparov on chess,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.780]   Daniel Lagrano on poker,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600]   and many more.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.240]   Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.280]   and the experience of being launched into space alone
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.720]   is worth the money.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.800]   By the way, you can watch it on basically any device.

[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.060]   And now here's my conversation with Peter Singer.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.640]   When did you first become conscious of the fact
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.320]   that there is much suffering in the world?
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.760]   - I think I was conscious of the fact
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.740]   that there's a lot of suffering in the world
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.520]   pretty much as soon as I was able to understand
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.960]   anything about my family and its background,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.700]   because I lost three of my four grandparents
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.640]   in the Holocaust.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.660]   And obviously I knew why I only had one grandparent
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.540]   and she herself had been in the camps and survived.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.100]   So I think I knew a lot about that pretty early.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.180]   - My entire family comes from the Soviet Union.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.700]   I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.240]   So sort of the World War II has deep roots
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.340]   in the culture and the suffering that the war brought.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.000]   The millions of people who died is in the music,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.900]   is in the literatures and the culture.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.660]   What do you think was the impact of the war broadly
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.400]   on our society?
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.840]   - The war had many impacts.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.440]   I think one of them, a beneficial impact,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.300]   is that it showed what racism
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.940]   and authoritarian government can do.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.080]   And at least as far as the West was concerned,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.200]   I think that meant that I grew up in an era
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.020]   in which there wasn't the kind of overt racism
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.180]   and antisemitism that had existed for my parents in Europe.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.840]   I was growing up in Australia
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.580]   and certainly that was clearly seen
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.420]   as something completely unacceptable.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:05.620]   There was also though a fear of a further outbreak of war,
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.960]   which this time we expected would be nuclear
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.740]   because of the way the Second World War had ended.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.220]   So there was this overshadowing of my childhood
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.920]   about the possibility that I would not live to grow up
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.800]   and be an adult because of a catastrophic nuclear war.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.140]   There was a film on the beach was made
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.300]   in which the city that I was living, Melbourne,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.380]   was the last place on earth to have living human beings
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.460]   because of the nuclear cloud
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.160]   that was spreading from the North.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.880]   So that certainly gave us a bit of that sense.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.420]   There were clearly many other legacies
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.580]   that we got of the war as well
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.460]   and the whole setup of the world
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.620]   and the Cold War that followed.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.020]   All of that has its roots in the Second World War.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.180]   - You know, there is much beauty that comes from war.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.420]   Sort of, I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.940]   He said, "Everything is great about war
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.460]   "except all the death and suffering."
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.180]   Do you think there's something positive
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.680]   that came from the war?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.860]   The mirror that it put to our society,
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.340]   sort of the ripple effects on it, ethically speaking,
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.580]   do you think there are positive aspects to war?
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.580]   - I find it hard to see positive aspects in war.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.940]   And some of the things that other people
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.420]   think of as positive and beautiful,
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.640]   I'm maybe questioning.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.300]   So there's a certain kind of patriotism.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.940]   People say, you know, "During wartime, we all pull together.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.100]   "We all work together against a common enemy."
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.300]   And that's true.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.380]   An outside enemy does unite a country.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.940]   And in general, it's good for countries to be united
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.100]   and have common purposes.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.380]   But it also engenders a kind of a nationalism
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.780]   and a patriotism that can't be questioned
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.020]   and that I'm more skeptical about.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.600]   - What about the brotherhood
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.280]   that people talk about from soldiers?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.000]   The sort of counterintuitive sad idea
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.280]   that the closest that people feel to each other
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.920]   is in those moments of suffering,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.400]   of being at the sort of the edge
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.040]   of seeing your comrades dying in your arms.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.480]   That somehow brings people extremely closely together.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.620]   Suffering brings people closer together.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.120]   How do you make sense of that?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.560]   - It may bring people close together,
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.460]   but there are other ways of bonding
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.880]   and being close to people, I think,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.160]   without the suffering and death that war entails.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.800]   - Perhaps you could see,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.720]   you can already hear the romanticized Russian in me.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.760]   We tend to romanticize suffering
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.460]   just a little bit in our literature and culture and so on.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.920]   Could you take a step back?
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.580]   And I apologize if it's a ridiculous question,
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.640]   but what is suffering?
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.760]   If you would try to define what suffering is,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.560]   how would you go about it?
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.720]   - Suffering is a conscious state.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.840]   There can be no suffering
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.140]   for a being who is completely unconscious.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.920]   And it's distinguished from other conscious states
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.140]   in terms of being one that,
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.040]   considered just in itself,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.480]   we would rather be without.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.520]   It's a conscious state that we wanna stop
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.000]   if we're experiencing,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.760]   or we wanna avoid having again
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.480]   if we've experienced it in the past.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.400]   And that's, I say, emphasized for its own sake,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.320]   because of course, people will say,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.600]   well, suffering strengthens the spirit,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.140]   it has good consequences.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.120]   And sometimes it does have those consequences.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.780]   And of course, sometimes we might undergo suffering.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.700]   We set ourselves a challenge to run a marathon
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.240]   or climb a mountain,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240]   or even just to go to the dentist
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.120]   so that the toothache doesn't get worse,
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.280]   even though we know the dentist
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.960]   is gonna hurt us to some extent.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   So I'm not saying that we never choose suffering,
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.240]   but I am saying that other things being equal,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.640]   we would rather not be in that state of consciousness.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.880]   - Is the ultimate goal,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.800]   so if you have the new 10 year anniversary release
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.160]   of the "Life You Can Save" book,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   really influential book,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.700]   we'll talk about it a bunch of times
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.780]   throughout this conversation,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.340]   but do you think it's possible
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.560]   to eradicate suffering?
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.800]   Is that the goal?
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.880]   Or do we want to achieve
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.560]   a kind of minimum threshold of suffering
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.520]   and then keeping a little drop of poison
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.160]   to keep things interesting in the world?
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.120]   - In practice, I don't think we ever will eliminate suffering
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.980]   so I think that little drop of poison, as you put it,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.400]   or if you like the contrasting dash
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.680]   of an unpleasant color, perhaps something like that,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.020]   in a otherwise harmonious and beautiful composition,
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.860]   that is gonna always be there.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.100]   If you ask me whether in theory,
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.560]   if we could get rid of it, we should,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.660]   I think the answer is whether in fact
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.760]   we would be better off
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.240]   or whether in terms of by eliminating the suffering,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.500]   we would also eliminate some of the highs,
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.820]   the positive highs.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.360]   And if that's so, then we might be prepared to say
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.600]   it's worth having a minimum of suffering
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.560]   in order to have the best possible experiences as well.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.720]   - Is there a relative aspect to suffering?
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   So when you talk about eradicating poverty in the world,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.880]   is this the more you succeed,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.680]   the more the bar of what defines poverty raises?
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.400]   Or is there at the basic human ethical level,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.180]   a bar that's absolute, that once you get above it,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.180]   then we can morally converge to feeling
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.640]   like we have eradicated poverty?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.680]   - I think they're both.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.000]   And I think this is true for poverty as well as suffering.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   There's an objective level of suffering or of poverty
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.640]   where we're talking about objective indicators,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.500]   like you're constantly hungry,
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.880]   you can't get enough food, you're constantly cold,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.600]   you can't get warm, you have some physical pains
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.480]   that you're never rid of.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.000]   I think those things are objective.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.840]   But it may also be true that if you do get rid of that
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.820]   and you get to the stage where all of those basic needs
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.080]   have been met, there may still be then new forms
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.680]   of suffering that develop.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.360]   And perhaps that's what we're seeing
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.680]   in the affluent societies we have.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.640]   That people get bored, for example.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.200]   They don't need to spend so many hours a day
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.360]   earning money to get enough to eat and shelter.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.220]   So now they're bored, they lack a sense of purpose.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.300]   That can happen.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.480]   And that then is a kind of a relative suffering
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.320]   that is distinct from the objective forms of suffering.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.520]   - But in your focus on eradicating suffering,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.960]   you don't think about that kind of,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.520]   the kind of interesting challenges and suffering
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.400]   that emerges in affluent societies?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.780]   That's just not, in your ethical, philosophical brain,
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.240]   is that of interest at all?
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.120]   - It would be of interest to me if we had eliminated
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.500]   all of the objective forms of suffering,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.240]   which I think of as generally more severe
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.200]   and also perhaps easier at this stage anyway
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.000]   to know how to eliminate.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.320]   So yes, in some future state,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.560]   when we've eliminated those objective forms of suffering,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.080]   I would be interested in trying to eliminate
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.900]   the relative forms as well.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.920]   But that's not a practical need for me at the moment.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.380]   - Sorry to linger on it because you kind of said it,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.360]   but just to, is elimination the goal
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.600]   for the affluent society?
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   So is there a, do you see a suffering as a creative force?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.080]   - Suffering can be a creative force.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.520]   I think I'll repeating what I said about the highs
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   and whether we need some of the lows
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.080]   to experience the highs.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.520]   So it may be that suffering makes us more creative
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   and we regard that as worthwhile.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.880]   Maybe that brings some of those highs with it
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.480]   that we would not have had if we'd had no suffering.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.680]   I don't really know.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.480]   Many people have suggested that
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.060]   and I certainly can't have no basis for denying it.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.660]   And if it's true,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.240]   then I would not want to eliminate suffering completely.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.940]   - But the focus is on the absolute,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.820]   not to be cold, not to be hungry.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.780]   - Yes, that's at the present stage
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.060]   of where the world's population is, that's the focus.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.380]   - Talking about human nature for a second,
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.420]   do you think people are inherently good
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.980]   or do we all have good and evil in us
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.860]   that basically everyone is capable of evil
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.180]   based on the environment?
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.700]   - Certainly most of us have potential
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.460]   for both good and evil.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.020]   I'm not prepared to say that everyone is capable of evil.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.180]   That maybe some people who even in the worst of circumstances
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.900]   would not be capable of it,
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.380]   but most of us are very susceptible
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.500]   to environmental influences.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   So when we look at things
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.900]   that we were talking about previously,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.460]   let's say what the Nazis did during the Holocaust,
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.580]   I think it's quite difficult to say,
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.220]   I know that I would not have done those things
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.640]   even if I were in the same circumstances
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.460]   as those who did them.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.260]   Even if let's say I had grown up under the Nazi regime
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.460]   and had been indoctrinated with racist ideas,
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.100]   had also had the idea that I must obey orders,
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.860]   follow the commands of the Führer.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.500]   Plus of course, perhaps the threat
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.540]   that if I didn't do certain things,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.580]   I might get sent to the Russian front
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.180]   and that would be a pretty grim fate.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.740]   I think it's really hard for anybody to say,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.740]   nevertheless I know I would not have killed those Jews
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.420]   or whatever else it was that they--
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   - What's your intuition?
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   How many people will be able to say that?
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.900]   - Truly to be able to say it?
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.700]   I think very few, less than 10%.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.740]   - To me it seems a very interesting
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.140]   and powerful thing to meditate on.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.860]   So I've read a lot about the war, World War II,
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.940]   and I can't escape the thought
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.700]   that I would have not been one of the 10%.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.460]   - Right, I have to say I simply don't know.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.060]   I would like to hope that I would have been one of the 10%,
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.060]   but I don't really have any basis for claiming
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.300]   that I would have been different from the majority.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.460]   Is it a worthwhile thing to contemplate?
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.420]   It would be interesting if we could find a way
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.220]   of really finding these answers.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.660]   There obviously is quite a bit of research
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.820]   on people during the Holocaust,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.820]   on how ordinary Germans got led to do terrible things,
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.220]   and there are also studies of the resistance,
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.420]   some heroic people in the White Rose group, for example,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.780]   who resisted even though they knew
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.340]   they were likely to die for it.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.100]   But I don't know whether these studies
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.220]   really can answer your larger question
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.340]   of how many people would have been capable of doing that.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.380]   - Well, sort of the reason I think it's interesting
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.360]   is in the world, as you've described,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.980]   when there are things that you'd like to do that are good,
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.420]   that are objectively good,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.860]   it's useful to think about whether
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.740]   I'm not willing to do something,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.020]   or I'm not willing to acknowledge something
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.780]   as good and the right thing to do
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.780]   because I'm simply scared of putting my life,
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.940]   of damaging my life in some kind of way.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.780]   And that kind of thought exercise is helpful
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.460]   to understand what is the right thing
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.460]   in my current skillset and the capacity to do.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.060]   So if there's things that are convenient,
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.980]   and I wonder if there are things
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.700]   that are highly inconvenient,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.700]   where I would have to experience derision or hatred
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.700]   or death or all those kinds of things,
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.260]   but it is truly the right thing to do.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.720]   And that kind of balance is,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.740]   I feel like in America, we don't have,
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.040]   it's difficult to think in the current times,
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.380]   it seems easier to put yourself back in history
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.780]   where you can sort of objectively contemplate whether,
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.900]   how willing you are to do the right thing
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.220]   when the cost is high.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.100]   - True, but I think we do face those challenges today.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.000]   And I think we can still ask ourselves those questions.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.540]   So one stand that I took more than 40 years ago now
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.540]   was to stop eating meat, become a vegetarian at a time
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.380]   when you hardly met anybody who was a vegetarian,
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.740]   or if you did, they might've been a Hindu
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.580]   or they might've had some weird theories
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.000]   about meat and health.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.300]   And I know thinking about making that decision,
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   I was convinced that it was the right thing to do,
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.260]   but I still did have to think,
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.100]   are all my friends gonna think that I'm a crank
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.180]   because I'm now refusing to eat meat?
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:47.780]   So, I'm not saying there were any terrible sanctions,
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.040]   obviously, but I thought about that.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.580]   And I guess I decided, well,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.060]   I still think this is the right thing to do.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.300]   And I'll put up with that if it happens.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.060]   And one or two friends were clearly uncomfortable
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.460]   with that decision, but that was pretty minor
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.820]   compared to the historical examples
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.000]   that we've been talking about.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.820]   But other issues that we have around too,
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.740]   like global poverty and what we ought to be doing about that
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.860]   is another question where people, I think,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.040]   can have the opportunity to take a stand
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   on what's the right thing to do now.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.200]   Climate change would be a third question
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.680]   where, again, people are taking a stand.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.120]   I can look at Greta Thunberg there and say,
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.360]   well, I think it must've taken a lot of courage
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.280]   for a schoolgirl to say,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.180]   I'm gonna go on strike about climate change
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.460]   and see what happens.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.000]   - Yeah, especially in this divisive world,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.600]   she gets exceptionally huge amounts of support
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.440]   and hatred both.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.280]   - That's right.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.680]   - It's very difficult for a teenager to operate in.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.120]   In your book, "Ethics in the Real World,"
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.920]   amazing book, people should check it out.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.640]   Very easy read.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.980]   82 brief essays on things that matter.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.960]   One of the essays asks, should robots have rights?
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   You've written about this,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.640]   so let me ask, should robots have rights?
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.600]   - If we ever develop robots capable of consciousness,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   capable of having their own internal perspective
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.120]   on what's happening to them
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.640]   so that their lives can go well or badly for them,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.760]   then robots should have rights.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.120]   Until that happens, they shouldn't.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.520]   - So is consciousness essentially
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.200]   a prerequisite to suffering?
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.440]   So everything that possesses consciousness
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.960]   is capable of suffering, put another way.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.040]   And if so, what is consciousness?
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.360]   - I certainly think that consciousness
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.120]   is a prerequisite for suffering.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.640]   You can't suffer if you're not conscious.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.200]   But is it true that every being that is conscious
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.400]   will suffer or has to be capable of suffering?
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.220]   I suppose you could imagine a kind of consciousness,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.960]   especially if we can construct it artificially,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.880]   that's capable of experiencing pleasure.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.760]   But just automatically cuts at the consciousness
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.280]   when they're suffering.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.440]   So they're like instant anesthesia
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.560]   as soon as something is gonna cause you suffering.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.080]   So that's possible, but doesn't exist
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.860]   as far as we know on this planet yet.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.880]   You asked what is consciousness.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.440]   Philosophers often talk about it
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.520]   as there being a subject of experiences.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.920]   So you and I and everybody listening to this
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.640]   is a subject of experience.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.600]   There is a conscious subject who is taking things in,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.280]   responding to it in various ways,
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.480]   feeling good about it, feeling bad about it.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.400]   And that's different from the kinds
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.600]   of artificial intelligence we have now.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.120]   I take out my phone, I ask Google directions
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.680]   to where I'm going, Google gives me the directions
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.840]   and I choose to take a different way.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.360]   Google doesn't care, it's not like I'm offending Google
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.200]   or anything like that.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.520]   There is no subject of experiences there.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.360]   And I think that's the indication
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   that Google AI we have now is not conscious,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.560]   or at least that level of AI is not conscious.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.880]   And that's the way to think about it.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.040]   Now, it may be difficult to tell, of course,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.080]   whether a certain AI is or isn't conscious.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.900]   It may mimic consciousness and we can't tell
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.120]   if it's only mimicking it or if it's the real thing.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.600]   But that's what we're looking for.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.480]   Is there a subject of experience,
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.080]   a perspective on the world from which things can go well
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.160]   or badly from that perspective?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.200]   - So our idea of what suffering looks like
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   comes from just watching ourselves when we're in pain.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.320]   - Or when we're experiencing pleasure, it's not only--
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.600]   - Pleasure and pain.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.800]   Yeah, so, and then you could actually push back on this,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.960]   but I would say that's how we kind of build an intuition
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   about animals is we can infer the similarities
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.560]   between humans and animals and so infer
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   that they're suffering or not based on certain things
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.320]   and they're conscious or not.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   So what if robots, you mentioned Google Maps,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.720]   and I've done this experiment, so I work in robotics,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   just for my own self.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.640]   I have several Roomba robots
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   and I play with different speech interaction,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.160]   voice-based interaction.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.880]   And if the Roomba or the robot or Google Maps
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.360]   shows any signs of pain, like screaming or moaning
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.240]   or being displeased by something you've done,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   that in my mind, I can't help but immediately upgrade it.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.520]   And even when I myself programmed it in,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.040]   just having another entity that's now for the moment
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.120]   disjoint from me, showing signs of pain,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.160]   makes me feel like it is conscious.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.880]   Like I immediately then the whatever,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.800]   I immediately realize that it's not obviously,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.680]   but that feeling is there.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   So sort of, I guess, what do you think about a world
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:31.440]   where Google Maps and Roombas are pretending to be conscious
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.400]   and we, descendants of apes, are not smart enough
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.120]   to realize they're not, or whatever, or that is conscious,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.760]   they appear to be conscious.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.120]   And so you then have to give them rights.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.160]   The reason I'm asking that is that kind of capability
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   may be closer than we realize.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.960]   - Yes, that kind of capability may be closer,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.760]   but I don't think it follows
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.960]   that we have to give them rights.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.480]   I suppose the argument for saying
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.520]   that in those circumstances we should give them rights
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.560]   is that if we don't, we'll harden ourselves
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.000]   against other beings who are not robots
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.240]   and who really do suffer.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.920]   That's a possibility that, you know,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   if we get used to looking at a being suffering
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.400]   and saying, "Yeah, we don't have to do anything about that.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   "That being doesn't have any rights."
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.320]   Maybe we'll feel the same about animals, for instance.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.280]   And interestingly, among philosophers and thinkers
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.840]   who denied that we have any direct duties to animals,
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.560]   and this includes people like Thomas Aquinas
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.640]   and Immanuel Kant, they did say,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.520]   "Yes, but still it's better not to be cruel to them,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.480]   "not because of the suffering we're inflicting
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.880]   "on the animals, but because if we are,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.000]   "we may develop a cruel disposition,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.520]   "and this will be bad for humans, you know,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.640]   "because we're more likely to be cruel to other humans,
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.120]   "and that would be wrong."
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.760]   So-- - But you don't accept that--
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   - I don't accept that as the basis of the argument
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.600]   for why we shouldn't be cruel to animals.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.680]   I think the basis of the argument
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.000]   for why we shouldn't be cruel to animals
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.400]   is just that we're inflicting suffering on them,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.040]   and the suffering is a bad thing.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.000]   But possibly, I might accept some sort of parallel
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.040]   of that argument as a reason why you shouldn't be cruel
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.520]   to these robots that mimic the symptoms of pain
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.560]   if it's gonna be harder for us to distinguish.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.800]   - I would venture to say, I'd like to disagree with you,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.480]   and with most people, I think,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.280]   at the risk of sounding crazy.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.920]   I would like to say that if that Roomba is dedicated
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.880]   to faking the consciousness and the suffering,
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   I think it will be impossible for us.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.440]   I would like to apply the same argument
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.520]   as with animals to robots,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.920]   that they deserve rights in that sense.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   Now, we might outlaw the addition
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.640]   of those kinds of features into Roombas,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.120]   but once you do, I think,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.440]   I'm quite surprised by the upgrade in consciousness
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.760]   that the display of suffering creates.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.600]   It's a totally open world, but I'd like to just,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.700]   sort of the difference between animals and other humans
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.480]   is that in the robot case, we've added it in ourselves.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Therefore, we can say something about how real it is.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.200]   But I would like to say that the display of it
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.000]   is what makes it real.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.600]   And I'm not a philosopher, I'm not making that argument,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.160]   but I'd at least like to add that as a possibility.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.960]   And I've been surprised by it,
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.520]   is all I'm trying to articulate poorly, I suppose.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.900]   So there is a philosophical view
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.820]   has been held about humans,
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.540]   which is rather like what you're talking about,
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.780]   and that's behaviorism.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.500]   So behaviorism was employed both in psychology,
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.260]   people like B.F. Skinner was a famous behaviorist,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.780]   but in psychology, it was more a kind of a,
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.380]   what is it that makes this science?
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.500]   Well, you need to have behavior
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.700]   because that's what you can observe,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.300]   you can't observe consciousness.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.860]   But in philosophy, the view defended by people
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.040]   like Gilbert Ryle, who was a professor of philosophy
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   at Oxford, wrote a book called "The Concept of Mind,"
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.040]   in which, in this kind of phase,
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.320]   this is in the 40s of linguistic philosophy,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.960]   he said, well, the meaning of a term is its use,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.480]   and we use terms like so-and-so is in pain
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.860]   when we see somebody writhing or screaming
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.120]   or trying to escape some stimulus.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.440]   And that's the meaning of the term,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.480]   so that's what it is to be in pain.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.860]   And you point to the behavior.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.400]   And Norman Malcolm, who was another philosopher
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.920]   in the school from Cornell, had the view that,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.620]   so what is it to dream?
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.960]   After all, we can't see other people's dreams.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.040]   Well, when people wake up and say,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.100]   I've just had a dream of, here I was,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.740]   undressed, walking down the main street
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.780]   or whatever it is you've dreamt,
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.040]   that's what it is to have a dream,
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.760]   it's basically to wake up and recall something.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.640]   So you could apply this to what you're talking about
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.480]   and say, so what it is to be in pain
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.060]   is to exhibit these symptoms of pain behavior,
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.920]   and therefore, these robots are in pain,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.840]   that's what the word means.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.520]   But nowadays, not many people think
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.880]   that Ryle's kind of philosophical behaviorism
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.320]   is really very plausible,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.080]   so I think they would say the same about your view.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.560]   - So yes, I just spoke with Noam Chomsky,
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.760]   who basically was part of dismantling
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   the behaviorist movement, and I'm with that 100%
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.600]   for studying human behavior,
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.080]   but I am one of the few people in the world
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.240]   who has made Roombas scream in pain,
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.200]   and I just don't know what to do
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.520]   with that empirical evidence,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.760]   because it's hard, sort of philosophically, I agree,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.280]   but the only reason I philosophically agree in that case
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.120]   is because I was the programmer,
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.800]   but if somebody else was a programmer,
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.320]   I'm not sure I would be able to interpret that well.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.880]   So I think it's a new world,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.520]   that I was just curious what your thoughts are.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.320]   For now, you feel that the display
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.400]   of what we can kind of intellectually say
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.140]   is a fake display of suffering is not suffering.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.240]   - That's right, that would be my view,
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.480]   but that's consistent, of course,
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.920]   with the idea that it's part of our nature
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.680]   to respond to this display,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.140]   if it's reasonably authentically done,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.800]   and therefore it's understandable
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.680]   that people would feel this,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.880]   and maybe, as I said, it's even a good thing
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.720]   that they do feel it,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.640]   and you wouldn't want to harden yourself against it,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.440]   because then you might harden yourself
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.480]   against beings who are really suffering.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.200]   - But there's this line, you know,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.800]   so you said, "Once an artificial general intelligence system,
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   "a human-level intelligence system, become conscious."
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.520]   I guess, if I could just linger on it,
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.760]   now, I've wrote really dumb programs
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.780]   that just say things that I told them to say,
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.360]   but how do you know when a system like Alexa,
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.720]   which is sufficiently complex
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.080]   that you can't introspect of how it works,
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.240]   starts giving you signs of consciousness
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.040]   through natural language,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.200]   that there's a feeling there's another entity there
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.120]   that's self-aware, that has a fear of death, a mortality,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.880]   that has awareness of itself
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.580]   that we kind of associate with other living creatures?
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:05.720]   I guess I'm sort of trying to do the slippery slope
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.920]   from the very naive thing where I started
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.120]   into something where it's sufficiently a black box
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.400]   to where it's starting to feel like it's conscious.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.980]   Where's that threshold,
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.240]   where you would start getting uncomfortable
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.980]   with the idea of robot suffering, do you think?
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.640]   - I don't know enough about the programming
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.580]   that would go into this, really, to answer this question,
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.880]   but I presume that somebody who does know more about this
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.160]   could look at the program and see whether
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.560]   we can explain the behaviors in a parsimonious way
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   that doesn't require us to suggest
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   that some sort of consciousness has emerged.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.400]   Or alternatively, whether you're in a situation
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.200]   where you say, "I don't know how this is happening.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.080]   "The program does generate a kind of artificial
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.100]   "general intelligence which is autonomous,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.280]   "starts to do things itself and is autonomous
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.400]   "of the basic programming that set it up."
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   And so it's quite possible that actually
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.800]   we have achieved consciousness
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.600]   in a system of artificial intelligence.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.640]   - Sort of the approach that I work with,
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.700]   most of the community is really excited about now
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.000]   is with learning methods, so machine learning.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.960]   And the learning methods are unfortunately
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.440]   are not capable of revealing,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.140]   which is why somebody like Noam Chomsky criticizes them.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.660]   You've created powerful systems
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.080]   that are able to do certain things
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.140]   without understanding the theory, the physics,
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.180]   the science of how it works.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.340]   And so it's possible if those are the kinds of methods
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.340]   that succeed, we won't be able to know exactly,
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.820]   sort of try to reduce, try to find
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.180]   whether this thing is conscious or not,
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.140]   this thing is intelligent or not.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.800]   It's simply giving, when we talk to it,
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.840]   it displays wit and humor and cleverness
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   and emotion and fear, and then we won't be able to say,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.520]   where in the billions of nodes, neurons
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:19.120]   in this artificial neural network is the fear coming from?
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.480]   So in that case, that's a really interesting place
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.460]   where we do now start to return to behaviorism and say,
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   hmm, yeah, that is an interesting issue.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.940]   I would say that if we have serious doubts
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.420]   and think it might be conscious,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.880]   then we ought to try to give it the benefit of the doubt,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.380]   just as I would say with animals.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.860]   I think we can be highly confident
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.460]   that vertebrates are conscious,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.480]   but when we get down, and some invertebrates
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.900]   like the octopus, but with insects,
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.460]   it's much harder to be confident of that.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.220]   I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.200]   where we can, which means, I think it would be wrong
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.380]   to torture an insect, but this doesn't necessarily mean
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.780]   it's wrong to slap a mosquito that's about to bite you
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.300]   and stop you getting to sleep.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.100]   So I think you try to achieve some balance
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.000]   in these circumstances of uncertainty.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.460]   - If it's okay with you, if we can go back just briefly.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.660]   So 44 years ago, like you mentioned, 40 plus years ago,
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.180]   you've written "Animal Liberation,"
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.340]   the classic book that started, that launched,
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.960]   that was the foundation of the movement
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.400]   of animal liberation.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.460]   Can you summarize the key set of ideas
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.380]   that underpin that book?
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.000]   - Certainly, the key idea that underlies that book
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.200]   is the concept of speciesism,
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.760]   which I did not invent that term.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.720]   I took it from a man called Richard Rider,
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.640]   who was in Oxford when I was, and I saw a pamphlet
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.000]   that he'd written about experiments on chimpanzees
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.060]   that used that term.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.020]   But I think I contributed to making it philosophically
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:12.040]   more precise and to getting it into a broader audience.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.760]   And the idea is that we have a bias or a prejudice
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.400]   against taking seriously the interests of beings
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.440]   who are not members of our species,
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.900]   just as in the past, Europeans, for example,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.600]   had a bias against taking seriously
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.560]   the interests of Africans, racism,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.040]   and men have had a bias against taking seriously
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.280]   the interests of women, sexism.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   So I think something analogous, not completely identical,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.040]   but something analogous, goes on and has gone on
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.480]   for a very long time with the way humans
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.400]   see themselves vis-a-vis animals.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.880]   We see ourselves as more important.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.280]   We see animals as existing to serve our needs
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   in various ways, and you can find this very explicit
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.440]   in earlier philosophers from Aristotle
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.020]   through to Kant and others.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:12.000]   And either we don't need to take their interests
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.660]   into account at all, or we can discount it
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.800]   because they're not humans.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.400]   They count a little bit, but they don't count
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.040]   nearly as much as humans do.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.720]   My book argues that that attitude is responsible
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.320]   for a lot of the things that we do to animals
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.080]   that are wrong, confining them indoors
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.640]   in very crowded, cramped conditions,
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.760]   in factory farms to produce meat or eggs
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.720]   or milk more cheaply, using them in some research
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.360]   that's by no means essential for our survival
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.240]   or well-being, and a whole lot, you know,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.280]   some of the sports and things that we do to animals.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.920]   So I think that's unjustified because I think
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.080]   the significance of pain and suffering
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.480]   does not depend on the species of the being
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.920]   who is in pain or suffering any more than it depends
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.840]   on the race or sex of the being who is in pain or suffering.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.720]   And I think we ought to rethink our treatment of animals
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.280]   along the lines of saying, if the pain is just as great
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.040]   in an animal, then it's just as bad that it happens
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.540]   as if it were a human.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.960]   - Maybe if I could ask, I apologize.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.520]   Hopefully it's not a ridiculous question,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.320]   but so as far as we know, we cannot communicate
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.240]   with animals through natural language,
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.280]   but we would be able to communicate with robots,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.040]   so I'm returning to sort of a small parallel
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.400]   between perhaps animals and the future of AI.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:51.320]   If we do create an AGI system or as we approach creating
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   that AGI system, what kind of questions would you ask her
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.000]   to try to intuit whether there is consciousness
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.420]   or more importantly, whether there's capacity to suffer?
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.260]   - I might ask the AGI what she was feeling,
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.820]   well, does she have feelings?
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.660]   And if she says yes, to describe those feelings,
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.580]   to describe what they were like,
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.380]   to see what the phenomenal account
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.080]   of consciousness is like.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.060]   That's one question.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:38.540]   I might also try to find out if the AGI has a sense
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.220]   of itself, so for example, the idea,
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.380]   would you, we often ask people,
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.660]   so suppose you're in a car accident
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.900]   and your brain were transplanted into someone else's body,
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.260]   do you think you would survive
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.180]   or would it be the person whose body was still surviving,
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.740]   your body having been destroyed?
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.340]   And most people say, I think I would,
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.500]   if my brain was transplanted along with my memories
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.100]   and so on, I would survive.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.940]   So we could ask AGI those kinds of questions
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.700]   if they were transferred to a different piece of hardware,
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.380]   would they survive, what would survive?
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.340]   Get at that sort of concept.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.380]   - Sort of on that line, another perhaps absurd question,
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.660]   but do you think having a body
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.820]   is necessary for consciousness?
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.680]   So do you think digital beings can suffer?
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.300]   - Presumably digital beings need to be running
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.980]   on some kind of hardware, right?
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.780]   - Yeah, that ultimately boils down to,
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.460]   but this is exactly what you just said,
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.420]   is moving the brain from one place to another.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.780]   - So you could move it to a different kind of hardware,
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.540]   and they could say, look,
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.300]   your hardware is getting worn out,
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.100]   we're going to transfer you to a fresh piece of hardware,
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.100]   so we're gonna shut you down for a time,
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.180]   but don't worry, you'll be running very soon
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.260]   on a nice, fresh piece of hardware.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.220]   And you could imagine this conscious AGI saying,
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.320]   that's fine, I don't mind having a little rest,
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.740]   just make sure you don't lose me, or something like that.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.340]   - Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting thought,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.900]   that even with us humans, the suffering is in the software.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.300]   We right now don't know how to repair the hardware,
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.180]   but we're getting better at it, and better in the idea.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.140]   I mean, a lot of, some people dream about one day
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:30.780]   being able to transfer certain aspects of the software
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.980]   to another piece of hardware.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.740]   What do you think, just on that topic,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.200]   there's been a lot of exciting innovation
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.180]   in brain-computer interfaces.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.680]   I don't know if you're familiar with the companies
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.960]   like Neuralink with Elon Musk,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.200]   communicating both ways from a computer,
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.520]   being able to send, activate neurons,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.840]   and being able to read spikes from neurons.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.900]   With the dream of being able to expand,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.440]   sort of increase the bandwidth at which your brain
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.240]   can look up articles on Wikipedia, kind of thing.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.340]   Sort of expand the knowledge capacity of the brain.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:13.140]   Do you think that notion, is that interesting to you,
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.520]   as the expansion of the human mind?
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.300]   - Yes, that's very interesting.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.960]   I'd love to be able to have that increased bandwidth.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.680]   And I want better access to my memory, I have to say, too.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.280]   As I get older, I talk to my wife about things
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.280]   that we did 20 years ago, or something.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.680]   Her memory is often better about particular events.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.220]   Where were we, who was at that event?
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.360]   What did he or she wear, even, she may know.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.040]   And I have not the faintest idea about this.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.880]   But perhaps it's somewhere in my memory.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.560]   And if I had this extended memory,
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.580]   I could search that particular year and rerun those things.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.980]   I think that would be great.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.120]   - In some sense, we already have that
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.240]   by storing so much of our data online,
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.760]   like pictures of different events.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.520]   - Yes, well, Gmail is fantastic for that,
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.960]   because people email me as if they know me well,
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.440]   and I haven't got a clue who they are,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.680]   but then I search for their name.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   And I just got emailed me in 2007,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   and I know who they are now.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.440]   - Yeah, so we're already,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.080]   we're taking the first steps already.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.480]   So on the flip side of AI, people like Stuart Russell
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.280]   and others focus on the control problem,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.800]   value alignment in AI, which is the problem
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.400]   of making sure we build systems
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.520]   that align to our own values, our ethics.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.440]   Do you think, sort of high level,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.160]   how do we go about building systems,
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.640]   do you think is it possible that align with our values,
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.360]   align with our human ethics, or living being ethics?
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.320]   - Presumably it's possible to do that.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.080]   I know that a lot of people who think
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.960]   that there's a real danger that we won't,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.800]   that we'll more or less accidentally lose control of AGI.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.040]   - Do you have that fear yourself, personally?
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.560]   - I'm not quite sure what to think.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.840]   I talk to philosophers like Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.960]   and they think that this is a real problem
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.200]   we need to worry about.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   Then I talk to people who work for Microsoft
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.680]   or DeepMind or somebody, and they say,
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.280]   "No, we're not really that close to producing AGI,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.600]   super intelligence."
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.760]   - So if you look at Nick Bostrom's sort of the arguments,
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.960]   it's very hard to defend.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.080]   So I'm, of course, I am a self-engineer AI system,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.960]   so I'm more with the DeepMind folks
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.400]   where it seems that we're really far away.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.880]   But then the counter argument is,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.320]   is there any fundamental reason that we'll never achieve it?
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.200]   And if not, then eventually there'll be
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.640]   a dire existential risk, so we should be concerned about it.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.720]   And do you find that argument at all appealing
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.200]   in this domain or any domain,
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.960]   that eventually this will be a problem,
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.600]   so we should be worried about it?
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.760]   - Yes, I think it's a problem.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.360]   I think that's a valid point.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.160]   Of course, when you say eventually,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.480]   that raises the question, how far off is that?
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.840]   And is there something that we can do about it now?
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.480]   Because if we're talking about,
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.760]   this is gonna be 100 years in the future,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.120]   and you consider how rapidly our knowledge
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   of artificial intelligence has grown
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.040]   in the last 10 or 20 years,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   it seems unlikely that there's anything much we could do now
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.160]   that would influence whether this is going to happen
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.440]   100 years in the future.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.120]   People in 80 years in the future
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.320]   would be in a much better position to say,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.760]   this is what we need to do to prevent this happening
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.520]   than we are now.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.560]   So to some extent, I find that reassuring,
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.640]   but I'm all in favor of some people doing research
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.480]   into this to see if indeed it is that far off,
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.440]   or if we are in a position to do something about it sooner.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.760]   I'm very much of the view that extinction
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   is a terrible thing, and therefore,
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.960]   even if the risk of extinction is very small,
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.040]   if we can reduce that risk,
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.240]   that's something that we ought to do.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.760]   My disagreement with some of these people
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.360]   who talk about long-term risks, extinction risks,
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.840]   is only about how much priority that should have
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.520]   as compared to present questions.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.680]   - It was such a, if you look at the math of it
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.040]   from a utilitarian perspective,
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.920]   if it's existential risks, so everybody dies,
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.160]   that it feels like an infinity in the math equation
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   that that makes the math with the priorities difficult to do
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.720]   that if we don't know the timescale,
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.960]   and you can legitimately argue
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.800]   that it's non-zero probability that it'll happen tomorrow,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.080]   that how do you deal with these kinds of existential risks,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.720]   like from nuclear war, from nuclear weapons,
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.640]   from biological weapons, from,
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.960]   I'm not sure if global warming falls into that category,
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.800]   because global warming is a lot more gradual.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.840]   - And people say it's not an existential risk
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.280]   'cause there'll always be possibilities
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.200]   of some humans existing, farming Antarctica,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.240]   or northern Siberia, or something of that sort, yeah.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.080]   - But you don't find the sort of,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.640]   the complete existential risks, a fundamental,
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:24.720]   like an overriding part of the equations of ethics?
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.960]   - No, certainly if you treat it as an infinity,
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.000]   then it plays havoc with any calculations,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.440]   but arguably we shouldn't,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.340]   I mean, one of the ethical assumptions that goes into this
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.640]   is that the loss of future lives,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.800]   that is of merely possible lives,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.880]   of beings who may never exist at all,
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   is in some way comparable to the sufferings or deaths
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.660]   of people who do exist at some point.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.360]   And that's not clear to me.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.280]   I think there's a case for saying that,
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.780]   but I also think there's a case for taking the other view.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.520]   So that has some impact on it.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.880]   Of course, you might say, ah, yes,
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   but still if there's some uncertainty about this
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.520]   and the costs of extinction are infinite,
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.320]   then still it's gonna overwhelm everything else.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:20.840]   But I suppose I'm not convinced of that.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.400]   I'm not convinced that it's really infinite here.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.200]   And even Nick Bostrom in his discussion of this
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.520]   doesn't claim that there'll be an infinite number
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.360]   of lives lived.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.320]   He, what is it, 10 to the 56th or something?
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.020]   It's a vast number that I think he calculates.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   This is assuming we can upload consciousness onto these,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.560]   to look at digital forms,
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.280]   and therefore there'll be much more energy efficient,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.640]   but he calculates the amount of energy in the universe
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.680]   or something like that.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.480]   So the numbers are vast, but not infinite,
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.520]   which gives you some prospect maybe
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:55.360]   of resisting some of the argument.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   - The beautiful thing with Nick's arguments
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.800]   is he quickly jumps from the individual scale
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.080]   to the universal scale,
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.480]   which is just awe-inspiring to think of
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.200]   when you think about the entirety
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.880]   of the span of time of the universe.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.360]   It's both interesting from a computer science perspective,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.720]   AI perspective, and from an ethical perspective,
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.960]   the idea of utilitarianism.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.580]   Could you say what is utilitarianism?
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.000]   - Utilitarianism is the ethical view
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.400]   that the right thing to do is the act
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.680]   that has the greatest expected utility,
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.280]   where what that means is it's the act
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.840]   that will produce the best consequences,
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.640]   discounted by the odds that you won't be able
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.360]   to produce those consequences, that something will go wrong.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.840]   But in a simple case, let's assume we have certainty
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.100]   about what the consequences of our actions will be,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.540]   then the right action is the action
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.480]   that will produce the best consequences.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.040]   - Is that always, and by the way,
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.360]   there's a bunch of nuanced stuff
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.960]   that you talk with Sam Harris on this podcast
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.920]   on that people should go listen to.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.760]   It's great.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.920]   That's like two hours of moral philosophy discussion.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.520]   But is that an easy calculation?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.360]   - No, it's a difficult calculation.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.000]   And actually there's one thing that I need to add,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.320]   and that is utilitarians,
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   certainly the classical utilitarians,
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.760]   think that by best consequences,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.840]   we're talking about happiness
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.020]   and the absence of pain and suffering.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:22.920]   There are other consequentialists
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   who are not really utilitarians who say
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.740]   there are different things that could be good consequences.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.120]   Justice, freedom, human dignity, knowledge,
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.800]   they all count as good consequences too.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.040]   And that makes the calculations even more difficult
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.760]   'cause then you need to know how to balance these things off.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.520]   If you are just talking about wellbeing,
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.480]   using that term to express happiness
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.920]   and the absence of suffering,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.960]   I think that the calculation becomes more manageable
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.320]   in a philosophical sense.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.200]   It's still in practice, we don't know how to do it.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.960]   We don't know how to measure quantities
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.680]   of happiness and misery.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.880]   We don't know how to calculate the probabilities
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.740]   that different actions will produce this or that.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:13.040]   So at best, we can use it as a rough guide
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.500]   to different actions.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:19.500]   And one way we have to focus on the short-term consequences
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.760]   because we just can't really predict
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.320]   all of the longer-term ramifications.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.660]   - So what about the sort of,
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.660]   what about the extreme suffering of very small groups?
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.900]   Sort of utilitarianism is focused
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.560]   on the overall aggregate, right?
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.040]   How do you, would you say you yourself are utilitarian?
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.160]   - Yes, I'm utilitarian.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:48.160]   - Sort of, what do you make of the difficult, ethical,
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.960]   maybe poetic suffering of very few individuals?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.020]   - I think it's possible that that gets overridden
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.060]   by benefits to very large numbers of individuals.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.840]   I think that can be the right answer.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.400]   But before we conclude that it is the right answer,
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.920]   we have to know how severe the suffering is
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.300]   and how that compares with the benefits.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.380]   So I tend to think that extreme suffering
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:21.540]   is worse than, or is further, if you like,
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.540]   below the neutral level than extreme happiness
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.300]   or bliss is above it.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.720]   So when I think about the worst experiences possible
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.160]   and the best experiences possible,
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.200]   I don't think of them as equidistant from neutral.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.480]   So like it's a scale that goes from minus 100
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.840]   through zero as a neutral level to plus 100.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.360]   Because I know that I would not exchange
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.600]   an hour of my most pleasurable experiences
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.380]   for an hour of my most painful experiences.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:54.440]   Even, I wouldn't have an hour
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.380]   of my most painful experiences even for two hours
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:01.760]   or 10 hours of my most painful experiences.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.600]   Did I say that correctly?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.920]   Maybe 20 hours then.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.880]   It's not 21.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.720]   What's the exchange rate?
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.920]   - So that's the question.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.760]   What is the exchange rate?
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.960]   But I think it can be quite high.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.400]   So that's why you shouldn't just assume
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   that it's okay to make one person suffer extremely
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.520]   in order to make two people much better off.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.540]   It might be a much larger number.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.560]   But at some point, I do think you should aggregate
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   and the result will be,
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.800]   even though it violates our intuitions of justice
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.560]   and fairness, whatever it might be,
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.560]   of giving priority to those who are worse off,
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.680]   at some point, I still think
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.040]   that will be the right thing to do.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.480]   - Yeah, it's some complicated nonlinear function.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.000]   Can I ask a sort of out there question is,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.080]   the more and more we put our data out there,
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.200]   the more we're able to measure a bunch of factors
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.680]   of each of our individual human lives.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.940]   And I could foresee the ability to estimate well-being
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.940]   of whatever we together collectively agree
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.480]   and is in a good objective function
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.680]   from a utilitarian perspective.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:12.400]   Do you think it'll be possible and is a good idea
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   to push that kind of analysis to make then public decisions,
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.920]   perhaps with the help of AI?
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.560]   That here's a tax rate,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.280]   here's a tax rate at which well-being will be optimized.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.040]   - Yeah, that would be great if we really knew that,
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.360]   if we really could calculate that.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.120]   - No, but do you think it's possible to converge
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.640]   towards an agreement amongst humans,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.720]   towards an objective function
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.020]   or is it just a hopeless pursuit?
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.080]   - I don't think it's hopeless.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.320]   I think it would be difficult to get converged
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.880]   towards agreement, at least at present,
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.920]   because some people would say,
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.040]   I've got different views about justice
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.180]   and I think you ought to give priority
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.860]   to those who are worse off,
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.720]   even though I acknowledge that the gains
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.460]   that the worse off are making are less than the gains
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.720]   that those who are sort of medium badly off could be making.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.240]   So we still have all of these intuitions that we argue about.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.700]   So I don't think we would get agreement,
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.280]   but the fact that we wouldn't get agreement
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.040]   doesn't show that there isn't a right answer there.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.360]   - Do you think, who gets to say what is right and wrong?
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.640]   Do you think there's place for ethics oversight
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.400]   from the government?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.360]   So I'm thinking in the case of AI,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.940]   overseeing what kind of decisions AI can make or not,
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.720]   but also if you look at animal rights
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.580]   or rather not rights or perhaps rights,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.040]   but the ideas you've explored in animal liberation,
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.140]   who gets to, so you eloquently, beautifully
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.120]   write in your book that this, you know,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.720]   we shouldn't do this, but is there some harder rules
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.640]   that should be imposed?
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.720]   Or is this a collective thing we converse towards a society
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   and thereby make the better and better ethical decisions?
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.360]   - Politically, I'm still a Democrat
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.920]   despite looking at the flaws in democracy
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.200]   and the way it doesn't work always very well.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   So I don't see a better option than allowing the public
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:20.000]   to vote for governments in accordance with their policies.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.800]   And I hope that they will vote for policies
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   that reduce the suffering of animals
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.600]   and reduce the suffering of distant humans,
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.640]   whether geographically distant or distant
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.160]   because they're future humans.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.720]   But I recognise that democracy isn't really well set up
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.560]   to do that.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:44.320]   And in a sense, you could imagine a wise
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:48.720]   and benevolent, you know, omnibenevolent leader
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.840]   who would do that better than democracies could.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.680]   But in the world in which we live,
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.400]   it's difficult to imagine that this leader
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.320]   isn't gonna be corrupted by a variety of influences.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.440]   You know, we've had so many examples of people
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.520]   who've taken power with good intentions
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.280]   and then have ended up being corrupt
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.620]   and favouring themselves.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.560]   So I don't know, you know, that's why, as I say,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.600]   I don't know that we have a better system than democracy
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.040]   to make these decisions.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.440]   - Well, so you also discuss effective altruism,
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.240]   which is a mechanism for going around government,
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.560]   for putting the power in the hands of the people
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.440]   to donate money towards causes to help, you know,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:37.960]   remove the middleman and give it directly
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.600]   to the causes that they care about.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.280]   Sort of, maybe this is a good time to ask,
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.240]   you've 10 years ago wrote "The Life You Can Save"
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.400]   that's now, I think, available for free online.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.880]   - That's right, you can download either the ebook
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.520]   or the audio book free from thelifeyoucansave.org.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.480]   - And what are the key ideas that you present in the book?
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.200]   - The main thing I wanna do in the book
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   is to make people realise that it's not difficult
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.720]   to help people in extreme poverty,
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.800]   that there are highly effective organisations now
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.320]   that are doing this, that they've been independently assessed
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   and verified by research teams that are expert in this area,
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.200]   and that it's a fulfilling thing to do
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.680]   for at least part of your life.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.840]   You know, we can't all be saints,
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.360]   but at least one of your goals should be
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.920]   to really make a positive contribution to the world
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.280]   and to do something to help people
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.960]   who through no fault of their own
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.560]   are in very dire circumstances
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.560]   and living a life that is barely, or perhaps not at all,
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.960]   a decent life for a human being to live.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   - So you describe a minimum ethical standard of giving.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.400]   What advice would you give to people
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.400]   that want to be effectively altruistic in their life,
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.400]   like live an effective altruism life?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.120]   - There are many different kinds of ways of living
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.600]   as an effective altruist.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.720]   And if you're at the point where you're thinking
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.760]   about your long-term career,
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.160]   I'd recommend you take a look at a website
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.720]   called 80,000 Hours, 80,000Hours.org,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.240]   which looks at ethical career choices.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.800]   And they range from, for example,
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.120]   going to work on Wall Street
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.400]   so that you can earn a huge amount of money
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.000]   and then donate most of it to effective charities,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.880]   to going to work for a really good nonprofit organization
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.080]   so that you can directly use your skills and ability
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.480]   and hard work to further a good cause,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.840]   or perhaps going into politics,
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.200]   maybe small chances but big payoffs in politics.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.560]   Go to work in the public service
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.240]   where if you're talented, you might rise to a higher level
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.760]   where you can influence decisions.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.200]   Do research in an area where the payoffs could be great.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.240]   There are a lot of different opportunities,
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.400]   but too few people are even thinking about those questions.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.760]   They're just going along in some sort of preordained rut
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.840]   to particular careers.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.440]   Maybe they think they'll earn a lot of money
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.200]   and have a comfortable life,
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.960]   but they may not find that as fulfilling
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.520]   as actually knowing that they're making
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.120]   a positive difference to the world.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.080]   - What about in terms of,
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.160]   so that's like long-term, 80,000 hours.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.120]   So shorter term giving part of,
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.360]   well, actually it's part of that.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.120]   You go to work at Wall Street,
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.080]   if you would like to give a percentage of your income
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.440]   that you talk about in life, you can save that.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.840]   I mean, I was looking through, it's quite a compelling,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.480]   it's, I mean, I'm just a dumb engineer,
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.440]   so I like there's simple rules.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.760]   There's a nice percentage.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.520]   - Okay, so I do actually set out suggested levels of giving
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.480]   because people often ask me about this.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.840]   A popular answer is give 10%,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.400]   the traditional tithe that's recommended in Christianity
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.440]   and also Judaism.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.760]   But why should it be the same percentage
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.600]   irrespective of your income?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.240]   Tax scales reflect the idea that the more income you have,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.000]   the more you can pay tax.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.360]   And I think the same is true in what you can give.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   So I do set out a progressive donor scale
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.880]   which starts at 1% for people on modest incomes
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.880]   and rises to 33 1/3% for people who are really earning a lot.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.560]   And my idea is that I don't think any of these amounts
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.080]   really impose real hardship on people
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.760]   because they are progressive and geared to income.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.600]   So I think anybody can do this
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.920]   and can know that they're doing something significant
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.080]   to play their part in reducing the huge gap
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.760]   between people in extreme poverty in the world
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.200]   and people living affluent lives.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.760]   - And aside from it being an ethical life,
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.520]   it's one that you find more fulfilling
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.240]   because there's something about our human nature
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.720]   that, or some of our human natures,
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.080]   maybe most of our human nature
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   that enjoys doing the ethical thing.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.120]   - Yes, I make both those arguments,
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.440]   that it is an ethical requirement
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.200]   in the kind of world we live in today
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.440]   to help people in great need when we can easily do so,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.960]   but also that it is a rewarding thing
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.280]   and there's good psychological research
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.200]   showing that people who give more
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.560]   tend to be more satisfied with their lives.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.880]   And I think this has something to do
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.000]   with having a purpose that's larger than yourself.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.560]   And therefore, never being, if you like,
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.120]   never being bored sitting around,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.720]   oh, what will I do next?
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.200]   I've got nothing to do.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.040]   In a world like this,
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.320]   there are many good things that you can do
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.400]   and enjoy doing them.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.320]   Plus, you're working with other people
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.880]   in the effective altruism movement
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.240]   who are forming a community of other people
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.280]   with similar ideas and they tend to be interesting,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.080]   thoughtful, and good people as well.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.680]   And having friends of that sort
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.960]   is another big contribution to having a good life.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.280]   - So we talked about big things that are beyond ourselves,
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.560]   but we're also just human and mortal.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.360]   Do you ponder your own mortality?
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.600]   Is there insights about your philosophy,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.600]   the ethics that you gain from pondering your own mortality?
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.880]   - Clearly, as you get into your 70s,
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.320]   you can't help thinking about your own mortality.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.720]   But I don't know that I have great insights
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.080]   into that from my philosophy.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.280]   I don't think there's anything after the death of my body,
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.440]   assuming that we won't be able to upload my mind
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.320]   into anything at the time when I die.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.400]   So I don't think there's any afterlife
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.880]   or anything to look forward to in that sense.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.840]   - Do you fear death?
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.080]   So if you look at Ernest Becker
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.960]   and describing the motivating aspects
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:14.240]   of our ability to be cognizant of our mortality,
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.440]   do you have any of those elements
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.640]   in your driving your motivation in life?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.480]   - I suppose the fact that you have only a limited time
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.840]   to achieve the things that you wanna achieve
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.320]   gives you some sort of motivation
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.720]   to get going in achieving them.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.040]   And if we thought we were immortal,
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.320]   we might say, "Ah, I can put that off
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.080]   "for another decade or two."
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.760]   So there's that about it.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.040]   But otherwise, no, I'd rather have more time to do more.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.840]   I'd also like to be able to see how things go
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.520]   that I'm interested in.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.920]   Is climate change gonna turn out to be as dire
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.520]   as a lot of scientists say that it is going to be?
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.480]   Will we somehow scrape through
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.880]   with less damage than we thought?
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.840]   I'd really like to know the answers to those questions,
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.200]   but I guess I'm not going to.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.800]   - Well, you said there's nothing afterwards.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.080]   So let me ask the even more absurd question.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.160]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.120]   - I think the meaning of life is the meaning we give to it.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   I don't think that we were brought into the universe
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.880]   for any kind of larger purpose,
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.080]   but given that we exist,
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.480]   I think we can recognize that some things
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.480]   are objectively bad.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.640]   Extreme suffering is an example,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.080]   and other things are objectively good,
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.160]   like having a rich, fulfilling, enjoyable, pleasurable life.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.360]   And we can try to do our part in reducing the bad things
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.920]   and increasing the good things.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.520]   - So one way, the meaning,
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   is to do a little bit more of the good things,
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.640]   objectively good things,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.440]   and a little bit less of the bad things.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.960]   - Yeah, so do as much of the good things as you can,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.600]   and as little of the bad things.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.920]   - Peter, beautifully put,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.440]   I don't think there's a better place to end it.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.920]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.760]   - Thanks very much,

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.800]   from Peter Singer.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.640]   What one generation finds ridiculous, the next accepts.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.000]   And the third shudders when it looks back
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.120]   at what the first did.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.300]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
