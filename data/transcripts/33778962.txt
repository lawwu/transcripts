[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.760]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.400]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.240]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.200]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.980]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.400]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.640]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.720]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.120]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.720]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.080]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.500]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.500]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.280]   So, go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.020]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you to this episode
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.800]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   and I'm excited to introduce you to my friend, Barbara Harrell.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.540]   Barbara is gonna talk to us,
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.000]   or help us explore the math map.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Navigating the math map is exciting and scary
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.180]   and beautiful and confounding.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.480]   It's all of the things.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.160]   And so, Babs is gonna help us know what we need to know
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.080]   about embarking on this new adventure
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.640]   to learn math more classically.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880]   Babs, thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.540]   - Absolutely, I'm honored.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.840]   I'm honored to be here.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   - So, how long have you been homeschooling, Babs?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.060]   - So, I was just telling somebody forever
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.800]   because my oldest, he just graduated last year,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.960]   and we started when he was five, and we started with CC.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.480]   So, we went to a, it was like a curriculum fair.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600]   And this was when a lot of stuff had changed,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   has changed over the years.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900]   But when we first started,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.240]   the biggest thing that drew me was
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.960]   she was talking about history and how they did this timeline
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.720]   and how it included not just history
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.240]   that we probably know all about,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.760]   but it also included biblical history.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.280]   And honestly, I wanted to sign up for myself
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.080]   'cause I didn't know, right?
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.800]   I was always separating the two.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.160]   And so, I wanted to do it for myself
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   and then having my kids do it was a bonus, so.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.960]   I'm sort of the same way.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   I was really intrigued with that whole integration idea
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.260]   and using history kind of like a spine
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.640]   and branching off and studying all these different things,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   government and literature and science and language,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   all based off the spine of a timeline.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.480]   So yeah, I was really intrigued by that too.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.880]   That's really cool.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   Well, and so you, were you looking,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.240]   did you know that you were looking for a classical education
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.360]   when you started homeschooling?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   - No, I didn't even know what classical education was.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   And as a matter of fact, when we first had my oldest son,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.340]   we did not plan to homeschool
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.460]   and I wasn't even sure I was gonna stay home.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.960]   And then once he arrived
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   and I just couldn't imagine going back to work.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.640]   And then the church that we were attending at the time
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   had so many homeschoolers there that the thought was planted
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.880]   and then we just started looking into it.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.500]   So yeah, never planned on homeschooling
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.700]   and didn't really know what classical education was.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.040]   And honestly, I'll say it probably took me
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.260]   at least five years to kind of really understand
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.260]   what classical education is, was, and can be.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.420]   And I feel like we're all still learning,
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.900]   especially now with the math math.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.160]   - Yes, I was gonna say that.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.100]   When our girls were born,
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.400]   I started reading about homeschooling.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.140]   I had friends who were doing it who said,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.020]   "Oh, you'd be a natural, you're already doing it.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.180]   "I watch you with your kids
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.660]   "and you love to teach them things."
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.860]   And that was true.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.700]   But I had read a little bit about classical education,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.180]   but I didn't really know it.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.900]   I didn't really fully get it.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.220]   Even like you said, even when we signed up,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.500]   I was still learning about the classical model.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.420]   And I still feel like I am getting better and better
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.980]   as I go farther and farther in.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.140]   I have a richer and deeper understanding now.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.940]   But this whole idea, okay,
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   of a classical math curriculum sort of blew my mind
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.280]   when I heard Lee talking about this some years ago.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.980]   So that's what we want you to help us navigate today,
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.980]   the whole idea of how a math curriculum is classical
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.860]   and how different that is
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.660]   and how do we get over it being so different
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.820]   and why is it so wonderful and all of that stuff.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.820]   But before I jump in in the middle,
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.700]   I wanna ask you,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.940]   'cause Babs, you are a specialist in the math.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.380]   Tell people what you do with classical conversations now
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.520]   so they'll know why they should listen to you
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.180]   about the math now.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.940]   - Okay, so I guess to start,
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.060]   like just so everybody knows,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.820]   like I don't have a master's in math
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.460]   or a doctorate or anything like that.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.700]   I am going to school to get my master's.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.660]   I don't really know what my concentration is yet,
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.620]   but so I'm just a regular homeschool mom.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.380]   And when about five years ago,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.860]   I started working with Lee and Kirstie in the pilot.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.700]   And honestly, the very first meeting we had,
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.540]   my area representative,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.660]   he asked, did I wanna be a part of a pilot?
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.940]   And I said, yes, but I really didn't know it was math.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.620]   And so when we had this very first meeting
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.060]   and they were talking about it,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.020]   I was like, I think I might be in the wrong place.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.100]   I was thinking they probably need people
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.940]   who feel like they're very well-versed in mathematics.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.380]   And I did not feel that way.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.500]   But the response was, no, no, no,
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   we need people to realize that anybody can learn math.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.940]   You don't have to be this expert
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.180]   that went to school to get your doctorate in math,
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.020]   that anybody can learn mathematics.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.660]   And so that was the kind of the start.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.540]   And so we worked through the pilot,
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.460]   we've been piloting for like four years
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.100]   and in different communities all over the United States.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.500]   And so now I get to be what the title
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.860]   is a curriculum assistant.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.060]   And so what I do is just help directors
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.940]   as they're getting ready to launch,
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.060]   directing using the new complex materials.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.500]   We answer questions from parents,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.460]   we answer questions from directors,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.940]   really anybody that has questions, they email us,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.860]   we have orientations for directors.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.020]   So really just kind of supporting the directors and families
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.500]   as they're trying to learn this new curriculum.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.900]   And Shauna Howell, she's the other curriculum assistant,
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   she works with me, we're a really good team.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.460]   She has a lot of different experience than I do.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.180]   And so she brings a lot of different things to the table,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.460]   but between the two of us, we try to answer questions.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.460]   And really, again, we're just regular moms.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.460]   And so it's not like-- - I love that.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.940]   - You know, we don't have that.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.820]   I will say I've learned more in the mathematics field
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.220]   over the last five years than I ever learned
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.500]   when I was in school.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.340]   - Oh my gosh, but see, that is so encouraging.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.300]   I wanted people to hear all that stuff that you said,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   that you are a quote unquote regular person,
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.300]   that you're not a math genius, that you didn't have a PhD,
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.500]   that you didn't have a master's in math when you started.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.580]   And in fact, you never thought of yourself
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.500]   as particularly mathy when you started this.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.180]   So the math map is not a curriculum
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.260]   for quote unquote math people, but for all people,
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.700]   'cause you are that person.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.900]   And so are most of us.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.540]   So how, you said something while you were talking
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.500]   that I've heard people say before,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.100]   I've heard Lee say it before,
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.900]   and there were times when I thought, yeah, right.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.100]   But I believe it more and more now.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.100]   You said, Babs, that math is really for all of us.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.500]   So why is math really for all of us?
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.900]   And how does the math map help us discover that?
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.420]   - So I feel like, okay, when you think about,
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.940]   well, today's Halloween, we're recording this on Halloween.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.140]   And it always makes me think about like Reformation Day.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.980]   And honestly, I knew nothing about Reformation Day
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.180]   until we started CC.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.500]   So just gotta make that known.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.100]   But I think about back then,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.700]   we had priests who felt like they were the only ones
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.220]   who could have access to the Bible
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.500]   and they were just gonna tell people
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.460]   what they wanted to know, right?
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.060]   Or what they wanted them to know.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.060]   And we know how that ended, right?
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.500]   - Yes.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.020]   - So I feel like with math, our whole lives,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.500]   we've got these experts sometimes telling us,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.580]   well, I'm not really sure that you're smart enough
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.180]   to know all these advanced things.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.860]   So we're gonna teach you addition and subtraction
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.780]   and multiplication and division,
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.140]   maybe a little geometry, maybe a little bit of algebra,
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.140]   but all these other advanced things,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.380]   we're gonna save for some smarter people.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.300]   And I feel like that's why we feel like
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.380]   we're not math people,
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.820]   because we don't get to that, the more advanced things.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.460]   And so I feel like with the math,
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.100]   what they've done is they just, they lay it all out there.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.500]   This is everything you could possibly wanna know
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.900]   in the mathematics field.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.900]   And now we get to decide, like, what do I wanna do?
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.140]   Do I wanna dig in deeper and learn about a derivative
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.140]   or an integral, which honestly,
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.820]   vocabulary never heard of before the math math?
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.660]   - Yes, yes.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.220]   - And so, I feel like there are these groups out there
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.060]   that kinda wanna say, no, it's not for all people.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.340]   But what the math math does is say, no, it is for you.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.340]   And another thing too, is that like, God is a God of order.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.220]   And so I feel like He's like the first mathematician, right?
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.220]   And so if He had this creation and He had this order
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.900]   and He's created all these things that are related to math,
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.260]   why do I not get to study it?
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.620]   And so the math math brings all that together, right?
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.580]   We're trying to learn how to see God in math.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.440]   We're actually using art and trying to see,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.020]   like look at an art picture, how is this related to math?
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.020]   How is this related to God?
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.480]   And so really just bringing all these connections together.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.580]   And so I feel like that is, that's why, God created this.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.260]   And so He wants us to know.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.420]   He wouldn't just create something and say,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.260]   well, I'm gonna create this,
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.620]   but I don't really want you to know about it, right?
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.900]   - Or I'm gonna create it for some of you
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.580]   and hide it from others of you.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.420]   - Right, no.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.340]   - Yeah, that is so beautiful.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.980]   - I think too, one thing that the math math does,
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.100]   which I don't think anybody else does this,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.780]   is we're all studying the same topic on the same week.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.500]   And so like, if I have a five-year-old
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.380]   and I have a 16-year-old,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.020]   we have the same concept that we're looking at this week.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.340]   Now, obviously the five-year-old's lesson pages
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.380]   are gonna look a little different than my 16-year-old,
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.740]   but they're studying the same concept.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.620]   And so I can dig as deep as I want to.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.060]   That five-year-old, if he really enjoys that topic,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.380]   I can let him keep going, right?
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.820]   And so I think that's another way
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.700]   we can use this curriculum to bring our family together
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.660]   and try to have those conversations together
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.940]   and help each other.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.500]   Wouldn't it be cool if the 16-year-old
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.460]   helped the five-year-old?
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.500]   - Yes, because they will probably remember better than we
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.300]   what it was like to understand like a five-year-old
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.460]   and be able to see where they are,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.340]   but where they could go with it.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.020]   That's really cool.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.060]   I love the whole idea that math is for everyone
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.220]   because God is for everyone.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:49.180]   And God created the order and the beauty in the world
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.300]   for us to discover and for us to participate in.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.140]   I really liked what you said,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.460]   and we'll explore it a little bit more, Babs,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.460]   about the math map making more math accessible
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:08.660]   to more of us using lots of different avenues.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.420]   Like you talked about art.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.540]   I just think that that is one way
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.460]   that the math map does make math for everyone
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.740]   because it realizes that there might be a different hook
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.420]   that will grab all of us.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   We might be pulled into mathematical thinking
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.060]   or even into a thought that we never considered
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.540]   as a math thought before this curriculum.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.820]   - And there's a project we have called Seeing the Unseen.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.660]   - Yeah.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.580]   - It's at the end of the year.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.220]   And a lot of our kids who really love art,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.860]   they kind of thrive in this area
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.820]   because they've learned all year
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.020]   how to find these connections.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.620]   Like how can I see God in the art?
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.420]   How can I see God in the math?
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.140]   But in this project, they can draw,
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.140]   they can find pictures of where they see God in math
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.860]   or where they see God in art,
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.180]   but it's all about this project.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.780]   And so I think a lot of our students enjoy that project
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.780]   because it's not just calculation.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.620]   It's not just I'm having a bunch of problems
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.100]   and I'm writing it down.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.740]   This is a creative project.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.300]   So if you do have those creative students,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.660]   then they get to shine during that time.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.700]   So they can either draw,
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.940]   like if they're a really good drawer artist,
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.380]   they can paint.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.380]   Or if they're not so great at that,
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.740]   they can find pictures in magazines.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.860]   - Right.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.700]   - And so that kind of thing.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.820]   So I feel like that's another way
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.180]   it can be accessible to everybody.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.660]   We're using that project
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.980]   to kind of bring everybody together,
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.940]   whatever talents they have,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.780]   bringing them to the table there.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.700]   - I like that.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.540]   I like that.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.220]   Now, I know that you guys,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.020]   you and Shawna and some other people
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.860]   are helping families that have gone ahead
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.580]   and dipped their toe into the math map
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.580]   who are getting immersed
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.500]   in this brand new curriculum this year.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.860]   You guys are helping.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.620]   But there are a lot of us that are just kind of,
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.980]   we're not there yet.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.660]   Maybe we don't have a student
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.980]   who is using the math map
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.940]   for their math education this year.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.060]   And we're just kind of hanging back
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.060]   and we're watching to see how it goes.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.100]   And some people are a little anxious
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.420]   about making a big change in a subject like math.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.060]   What's the biggest misconception
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.980]   about the math map
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.380]   among people who've heard about it
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.340]   but haven't experienced it yet?
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.820]   - So I think there's really two big things that I hear.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.180]   One is that,
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.060]   well, CC is really only doing this to make money
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.180]   so they can have their own curriculum.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.100]   And really, there's lots of reasons
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.260]   why we have this curriculum and we can talk about it.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.020]   But I think if you come to the book clubs
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.900]   and you get to hear Lee and Kirstie,
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.620]   and you really get to hear their heart
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.620]   behind why they're even here and offering their support,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.540]   you would really know that it's not about money.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.340]   And I would say too, like I said,
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.020]   I've only been working on the math map for five years
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.820]   but they've been working on it much longer than that.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.380]   And we just started making money.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.500]   Like as soon as the complex came out,
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.180]   that was the very first time we ever made money.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.340]   So how many years have you been spending money?
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.340]   - Lee has spent so much money to develop this curriculum
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.500]   that she feels so strongly about.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.420]   - Yes, and I think a lot of parents,
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.660]   I wanna say Shauna found this statistic somewhere
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.620]   about how many families are so apprehensive about math.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.620]   And so, they wanna kind of help in that regard
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.020]   and not make families feel so apprehensive about math
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.180]   because a lot of us, honestly,
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.220]   that's the first thing we outsource.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.260]   We look at math, we're like,
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.300]   well, I'm not a math person,
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.100]   and so I'm just gonna outsource it.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.700]   But I think we're missing so many of the blessings
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.060]   of trying to teach our kids math.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.380]   And so that's one thing that I think Lee and Kirstie do.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.460]   But another thing too is the conversations,
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.300]   the common conversations that we get to have,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.980]   not just with our families at home, but in community.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.100]   So now that we're using this in Challenge A,
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.900]   all of our kiddos, we're all doing the same curriculum.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.460]   We all can help each other.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.460]   We have a director that's there to offer support.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.420]   And so, that's another great reason
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.380]   to have our own curriculum.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.780]   And then also the thing about copyright,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.620]   we can't really provide support
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.100]   to other math curriculums out there
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.140]   because they have their own, right?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.220]   And there's a lot of copyright infringement.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.860]   So now that we have our own, we're not,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.860]   we don't have to do that.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.260]   So, but so that's one thing is that,
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.180]   I don't, I'm pretty sure that was not the intent.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   It's gonna make money,
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.380]   even though we just started making money now,
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.460]   and it's, I'm sure there's been a lot more spent
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.740]   than what we've made.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.860]   - Sure.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.380]   - I think the second one too is just looking at math
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.700]   and just saying, it's too hard.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.860]   Like I just can't do it.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.580]   And I remember, I don't,
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.540]   I think it was a book club that Lee, Lee said this.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.420]   She said, if you think about how hard it is
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.500]   to be a new believer, like a new student of the Bible,
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.180]   it takes a lifetime to understand the Bible, right?
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.980]   And then the more we read the Bible,
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.740]   the more we get closer to Christ
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   and we just dig, dig, dig, right?
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.580]   - Yes.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.460]   - And I feel like, you know,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.100]   obviously we don't wanna compare the math map to the Bible.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.180]   - Right, but it's not what you're saying, I know.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.260]   - It's not, it's not what I'm saying.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.940]   But if we look at it in that way, you know,
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.740]   this is gonna be new in the beginning.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.460]   I'm learning alongside my student,
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.740]   then I can say, okay, it might be hard,
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.900]   but we can do it together
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.140]   and we can do a little bit at a time, right?
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.780]   I can learn a little bit this year,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.340]   we'll learn a little bit next year.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.700]   And sometimes our kids surpass us and that's okay.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.540]   - Yes.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.820]   I think our kids sometimes surpass us
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   because we have expectations as grownups.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.300]   And I do think people will look at the math map, Babs,
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.540]   and see it and think, now what?
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.100]   That is not math like I ever saw it.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.860]   I can hear people say, I know I'm not a math person,
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.980]   but this does not look like math to me.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.260]   This is not what I'm used to.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.620]   And so it's unfamiliar and unfamiliar things are hard.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.180]   And sometimes for some of us,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.140]   unfamiliar things are anxiety producing
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.180]   because they don't meet the expectations
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.620]   that we've always had.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.580]   And so we think, I don't know how that's gonna work.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.700]   It clearly doesn't work the way
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.620]   I've always seen math programs work.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.620]   And so I, as a grownup, am a little suspicious.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.940]   Oh yes, I'm a little suspicious.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.220]   How is this gonna turn out?
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.980]   Whereas kids are like, cool, I get to trace this.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.180]   What is that weird symbol?
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.860]   Let's trace it with red.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.900]   Let's talk about that.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.600]   Let's find it on this page again.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.380]   They just go with the flow.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.020]   And we, as grownups, demand to understand everything.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.540]   And that, y'all, that's not the classical way.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.940]   The classical way is that we get the grammar
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.380]   and we learn in layers and slowly.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.940]   So what is the MathMaps Claim to Fame?
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.020]   Is it that it's a classical curriculum?
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.300]   - It is.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.860]   I mean, I really think it's probably the first
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.220]   or only one that I know of that's Christian and classical.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:01.060]   And that provides that one-room schoolhouse opportunity
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.940]   if parents want it.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.420]   There are parents who don't want it,
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.700]   who don't want one-room schoolhouse.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.860]   I get it. - Okay.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.540]   - You get to a point where you're seventh grade,
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.260]   you wanna start letting them be more independent,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.420]   and that's okay.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.780]   But for those families who do want the one-room schoolhouse,
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.620]   this is really, I think, is the only one I've ever seen.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.460]   - Yeah.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.400]   - Where we're all studying the same concept.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.260]   - Yes, yes.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.420]   So how is it classical?
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.980]   How is the MathMap classical?
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.340]   You said it's the only one,
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.380]   and it's the only one I've ever seen.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.340]   So how is the MathMap classical?
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.380]   And why is it so hard for us to wrap our minds
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.980]   around a curriculum that's classical,
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.200]   a math curriculum that's classical?
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.580]   - Most of us are used to instructor-led,
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.300]   I think the technical term is didactic teaching.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   - Yes.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.500]   - And so that's, you know,
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.140]   a teacher stands at the front of the room and she lectures.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.540]   He or she is telling us exactly what we need to know
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.260]   and why, and so that's what we're all used to.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.300]   But that's not classical.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   And so really, to learn classically is we start with,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.640]   what do I already know?
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.580]   We look at a problem that's completed
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.420]   and we look at all the steps,
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.200]   and then we compare it to a problem
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.300]   that doesn't have all the steps.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.740]   We look for patterns.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.060]   And this can lead to a light bulb, right?
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.020]   I can discover on my own how this problem works
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.580]   just by comparing and looking.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.120]   And nobody told me, nobody told me,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.940]   I discovered it on my own.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.540]   And I think when we discover it on our own, it lasts, right?
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.880]   We remember, if somebody else gives me a mnemonic,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.760]   maybe I'll get it, maybe I won't, right?
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.460]   But if I come up with this mnemonic that helps me
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.300]   with whatever I'm trying to learn,
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.220]   then I feel like it sticks, right?
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.660]   And so I think that's the big difference
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.900]   is we don't have somebody just standing over us saying,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.180]   this is exactly how to do it,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.660]   and this is what you should do.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.320]   We're discovering it on our own.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.660]   And yes, that is scary because this is math, right?
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.780]   And so I need to really attend, right?
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.100]   I need to slow down, look for the patterns,
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.700]   look at all the steps,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.020]   and then we get a deeper understanding.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.580]   And so I think that's why it's hard for us
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.420]   to wrap our minds around,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.840]   because number one, it's gonna take time, right?
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.820]   It's not gonna be where I just throw my kid
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.260]   in front of a screen and let somebody teach them,
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.080]   or even just give them a textbook and say,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.520]   read it and do it.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   Now, they're actually gonna have to slow down, right?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.840]   Lead the directions, look at the patterns,
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   figure out what they already know,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.580]   and then looking for those patterns
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.320]   kind of leads to the light bulb.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.400]   So I think that's a big reason why it's hard for us
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.360]   to wrap our minds around,
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.720]   'cause most of us have not been taught that way.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.920]   - Yes, yes.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.280]   You're right, you're right.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.880]   We aren't, we are taught, listen to the teacher,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.140]   do what she does, and do that to all of the problems
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.040]   that look like that.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   But nobody ever says, here are two different equations,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.700]   or here are two different shapes,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.720]   or here are two different number sentences.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.620]   What do you see that are alike?
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.100]   What about what you learned from last week?
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.260]   What was alike in that one?
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.660]   - You're right, you're right.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.700]   But it is so different.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.300]   I think that's why it's hard for us
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.580]   to wrap our minds around it.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.780]   It's not what we're used to.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.340]   And so we're a little fearful that it won't work out.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.620]   But here's the thing, all you classical parents
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.460]   who have been teaching your children to read classically,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.780]   and you've been teaching your children
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.460]   to study science and history classically,
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.340]   you've had your kids in foundations
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.220]   since they were four years old,
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.380]   and now they're 12 or 13, and you can look back and see,
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.380]   man, my child really does understand pieces of history.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.780]   And it all started 'cause they just memorized something.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.660]   You fully believed that the classical model,
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.460]   you now would tell somebody the classical model works, y'all.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.340]   It works.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.300]   I know you just think that your rote memorization,
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.580]   they're not really learning, but they are.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.820]   Can you give the math map that same chance?
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.660]   Can you learn math classically alongside your child
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   and trust that the understanding is gonna grow
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.500]   as the grasp of grammar grows?
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.100]   I think that's just really cool.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.420]   Okay, Babs, let me ask you this.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.380]   Say I believe it, I want to do this.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.900]   I want my family to transition to the math map.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.260]   What is your best tip for making the switch?
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.860]   Is it gonna be painless?
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.180]   And look, the giveaway answer to that is no,
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.580]   nothing is painless, that's worth it.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.260]   But what are the three big things that I need to do
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.060]   or keep in mind as we transition?
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.300]   I think the first thing is to remember
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.340]   that we are all learning
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.620]   how to teach math classically together.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.900]   That's the biggest thing.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.900]   I really feel like that's because, again,
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.020]   it's just brand new.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.380]   Most of us have not done it before.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.460]   We're all learning together.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.420]   If you have an opportunity to listen to Lee or Kirstie
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.860]   talk about the math map and their heart,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.900]   there's lots of videos on CC Connected,
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.060]   some are on YouTube,
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.700]   but really they just talk about their heart.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.580]   They talk about why we have the math map
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.380]   and teaching classically.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.700]   And I think that's the first thing.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.180]   Practically though, I think we have the naturals curriculum,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.420]   which is for ages five to six and older,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.180]   that's kind of one of the beginning ones,
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.300]   is downloading that, printing out the pages
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.980]   and just doing them together.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.740]   Read, copy, trace.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.900]   I remember there were a couple of times
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.900]   where I would go to Kirstie and I would have a question
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.500]   and she would say, "Did you read the directions?"
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.340]   (laughs)
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.460]   And I was like, "I'm sure I did."
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.860]   I go back and no, it just told me to read it
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.620]   or it just told me to copy it.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.460]   What I was trying to do-
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.580]   - Probably not to teach it or understand it.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.020]   - What I was trying to do was figure everything out
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.540]   this first time I'm looking at it,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.500]   but all it really told me to do was read or copy or trace.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.300]   And so I think that would be the second thing practically
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.900]   is downloading the naturals
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.180]   and just reading the directions and going through it.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.380]   You as a parent and then your kids as students.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.940]   And then the third thing I think is to go to the book clubs.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.660]   The book clubs are amazing.
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.460]   Right now, we're in the middle of where they're going
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.580]   through what it would look like in community,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.820]   using the in-community outline for these challenging kids.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.940]   And what I just love about it is Kirstie steps through
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.740]   what we're doing, but then she has a time at the end
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.980]   for question and answers.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.580]   And even if you don't bring a question, if you just listen.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.980]   - Yes, yes.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.100]   - The questions and answers are so helpful.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.540]   And I remember one in particular,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.460]   there was a, we kind of talked about this earlier,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.140]   but there was a mom that she said,
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.300]   "I'm just thankful that I have the opportunity
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.500]   because I feel robbed."
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.020]   Like, I never knew that I could learn about God
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.500]   through a math curriculum.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.180]   And so I feel robbed, like all these years,
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.100]   I've hated math and I didn't want to do math.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.740]   And now I realize I can do this math curriculum
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.860]   and I can learn more about God.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.300]   And so she was kind of like really emotional.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.620]   You know, like, I'm upset because it took me this long
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.220]   in my life to realize that I could have been doing
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.060]   this all along.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.340]   So I would say, you know, going to the book clubs,
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.260]   they're encouraging.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.780]   So, you know, watching introductory videos,
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.100]   downloading the naturals.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.380]   And then if you can, attending a book club
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.700]   would be my top three.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.940]   - That's really good because it really does help
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.700]   to hear what other people's experiences are like.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.660]   That's one reason you can go.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.820]   So you don't feel alone when you don't quite get it
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.980]   or when you can say out loud,
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.900]   this is not what I remember about math.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.940]   I mean, or for you to be able to say out loud,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.780]   my child asked me this question and I don't know the answer
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.940]   and this curriculum is not giving me the answer.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.500]   And to hear Kirstie say,
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.380]   well, what this curriculum is asking you to do right now
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.380]   is read and copy and trace and just to relax in that.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.500]   So I love it.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.340]   I think you're right.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.380]   It does help.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.060]   It helps to hear the vision.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.900]   But like you said, it helps us to see the practical,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.100]   to get an answer to our question
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.060]   or to be encouraged on how to find our own answer.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.900]   That's really cool.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.500]   I love the story about the mom who's just really glad
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.940]   that now she has the opportunity to see the Lord
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.460]   and to learn about Him as she does math.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.540]   Is that the kind of thing,
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   what is it that parents like best about the math map?
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.460]   - Oh, there's so many things.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.540]   So one is, we always hear in CC
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.300]   about redeeming your own education, reclaiming it, right?
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.420]   And so I think that's a big thing.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.380]   But what they like about it with their children
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.500]   is the conversations they get to have.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.100]   And that just starts with looking at the art, right?
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   They're looking at the art, they're finding connections.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.700]   And if you have multiple kids, different ages,
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.940]   you're gonna get all kinds of things on the spectrum.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.700]   And so just talking through those together,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.820]   I think the parents love those conversations.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.860]   And honestly, there are some families that are like,
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.740]   oh, it's just, there's a lot for me to take in,
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.220]   that's where I'm gonna start.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.420]   That's the only thing I'm gonna do this year
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.180]   is I'm gonna do the conversations first, right?
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.580]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.460]   - And so I think, if you feel overwhelmed,
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.700]   then just start there, right?
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.900]   'Cause that's one thing that parents say, that's the best.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.620]   The other thing is like the freedom
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.220]   because so like there's 16 lesson pages,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.060]   but the first four are like the brand new stuff.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.100]   And then the rest of them kind of repeat the same thing
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.020]   that's on those first four.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.780]   We have that repetition, that's part of being classical.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.260]   Well, as a parent, I don't have to do all these pages.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.220]   Like if we do the first four and I feel like,
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.620]   okay, they've been introduced,
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.300]   let's just say I only do the next four.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.140]   Well, I've still got repetition in there.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.980]   I don't technically have to tell them
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.220]   they have to do all the other pages, right?
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.580]   So I get to decide.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.580]   I get to choose how many pages my kids do,
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.100]   which order they do them in.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.060]   And I feel like parents want that freedom,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.940]   but they've been scared to say,
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.180]   well, you only have to do the odds or the evens
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.620]   thinking they're gonna miss them.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.860]   But now they feel like they do have more freedom
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.980]   because they know they're not gonna miss anything
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.260]   if they cover those first four pages.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.940]   - They've got the new material.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.820]   - Yeah, they've got the new stuff.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.660]   And then next year they're gonna see it again,
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.780]   next year they're gonna see it again, right?
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.340]   And so they're not gonna miss anything.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.540]   - Yes, I love that.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.340]   The building nature of the curriculum
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.660]   that you're always revisiting and reminding.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.900]   And so I know, you know,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.780]   that's what makes regular math curriculum
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.940]   kind of hard to teach as a group activity
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.260]   because somebody's gonna get it right away
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.100]   and somebody's gonna get it eventually
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   and somebody's never gonna get it.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.500]   But in a class, everybody's gonna move on.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.700]   And so you never know if the concept
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.780]   that your child sort of got is enough.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   But with the math map, your student,
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:24.220]   your child is gonna see all of these concepts again.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.580]   And they are gonna have lots of visiting
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.420]   with each new idea.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.740]   - And it's not just each year,
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.380]   like we'll see something in an early lesson
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.500]   that we're gonna see again
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.380]   in three or four lessons down the road.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.340]   So they're still gonna see it again, right?
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.620]   So I don't even have to wait until next year.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.300]   I just know that they're gonna see it again, right?
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.220]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.340]   And maybe even see it in a different way
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.340]   because we know that we don't all learn the same way.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.300]   Sometimes I will listen to my husband explain something
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.100]   to one of my kids and just think,
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.540]   "Yeah, I still don't know what in the world
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.860]   you're talking about."
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.420]   But the kid is like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.620]   But like her sister will be looking like,
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.460]   "You just started talking like Charlie Brown's teacher.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.060]   Wah, wah, wah, wah, I don't even know."
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.620]   And so that child will look at me and say,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.660]   "I mean, will you try to explain it to me?
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.780]   'Cause I don't understand daddy's way."
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.340]   And so I love it that the math map
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.660]   will give our students multiple ways
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.100]   to approach a new concept
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.300]   so that it is hospitable to everybody.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.500]   That's great.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.340]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.700]   What do kids, have you gotten much feedback
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.860]   from kids in the home who are doing the math map?
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.420]   What do they like the best about math map?
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:46.980]   - So one of the things that I heard early on
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.580]   was that they liked the fact that when CC's done,
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.500]   they are done with math.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.900]   Because there were 30 booklets for 30 weeks of challenge.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.660]   Whereas in Saxon, we had, well, sometimes 120,
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.500]   sometimes 140, depending on what level you were on.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.140]   And so I feel we were always behind in math.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.500]   Because we have one community day
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.580]   in the middle of the week.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.100]   And so you already are kind of behind,
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.180]   you gotta double up somewhere.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.740]   Life happens, and then you don't always get to do
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.780]   one lesson every day.
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.540]   So we end up doing, we were doing math all summer long.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.380]   - Yes, yes.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.220]   - And that is exhausting.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.900]   - Yes, you're never done, you're never done.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.740]   Yep.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.220]   - So now, I mean, that's the thing I think the kids like
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.300]   is they don't feel like they're behind
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.780]   and they're done, right?
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.500]   Now, I will say this for parents,
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.340]   just so parents know, like,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.540]   if you don't do all the pages during the year,
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.860]   if you want to have your kids keep working,
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.580]   you still have extra pages in there that they could do,
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.660]   right, if you, you know, want your student.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.340]   'Cause you know, sometimes if we go all summer
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.180]   and don't do anything, we forget.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.500]   - Yeah, you get rusty.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.340]   - Yeah.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.340]   So, you know, you can still review stuff,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.740]   but I think for kids, they're like,
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.020]   "Oh, it's week 30, I'm done," right?
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.860]   And I think another thing that I've heard from kids is
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.220]   they didn't really know that you can have conversations
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.060]   about math.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.900]   - Yeah.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.260]   - Because it was really like, you know, we think of math,
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.900]   we think of calculation, that's all we think about.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.940]   And so now the kids are like, "Oh, we can talk about it."
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.700]   Like, and I think they enjoy the conversations, you know,
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.980]   not just sitting there doing calculation work.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.900]   - Yeah.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.700]   I've heard kids say that the math map
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.700]   gives them an opportunity to wonder about things.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.620]   And they never thought that math was a place for wonder.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:41.620]   It seemed like a place for surety and proving things
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:45.860]   and, you know, balancing an equation or doing a proof
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.220]   or solving a problem.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.220]   And they didn't really see it as a place for wonder,
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.820]   but as just a place for solving.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.460]   - Yeah.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.420]   And I think too, a lot of them,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.620]   especially those who are like creative and artistic,
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.460]   they really like the fact that art has been brought into it.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.300]   - Yes.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.660]   - And then they, you know, like we've talked about before,
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.900]   that end of year project where they get to draw or paint
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.740]   or whatever it is.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.340]   And, oh, and I saw there was another kid,
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.940]   I think he had Play-Doh.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.020]   And he was like doing some of the lessons
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.140]   are like toward geometry,
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.780]   where we get into like 2D and 3D.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.540]   And he was making the shapes within, you know, using Play-Doh
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.500]   and, you know, we think Play-Doh is like for little kids,
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.260]   but we use Play-Doh in Challenge A all the time.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.500]   My kids love using Play-Doh.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.060]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.220]   - I mean, I think it's just,
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.860]   I think we just need to open the box
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.500]   and let our kids explore.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.260]   And, you know, I think that's one thing
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.020]   that the math map does help them do is it's not just,
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.500]   here's your worksheet, here's a calculation sheet.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.020]   It's, that's over, right?
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.300]   I think that it just gives them some freedom to do more
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.420]   than just calculate.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.060]   - Yeah, I think outside the box is really good.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.980]   And I think that more of our kids
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.340]   are willing to think outside the box
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.020]   with regard to math education than us as parents are.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.660]   We're so uptight as parents about education.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:15.460]   And our kids are so much more full of exploration,
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.100]   the heart of an explorer.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.260]   That's what lives in our kids.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.140]   Okay, I don't wanna go, I don't want,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.980]   I want us to talk about some practical questions
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.100]   'cause I feel like some people came on saying,
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.180]   okay, all that good stuff, all that good stuff,
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.100]   fine, fine, fine.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.220]   I believe it, I love it, I'm gonna do it.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.900]   But here's some practical questions, Babs.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.780]   What is it that we're supposed to do first every day?
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.380]   So what is advocated?
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.340]   'Cause I know it's different than regular math education.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.740]   I mean, regular, like I'm gonna tell you something new,
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.300]   some new piece of grammar, new vocabulary.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.420]   I'm gonna show you how to do a new kind of calculation
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.060]   and then you're gonna practice.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.220]   But the math map days don't start like that.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.580]   What do we do first?
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.700]   - So I would say first every day is do flashcards.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.020]   Some kind of calculation, right?
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.540]   Whether it's addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:15.260]   or what I really like, the new ones, the notations,
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.540]   the notation flashcards,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.700]   because I don't know all that grammar.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.980]   Like all that grammar is so new.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.580]   So I even use it for myself.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.420]   Like I'll just do two or three a day.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.220]   And this is a question we get asked so many times is,
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.940]   do you have a sheet that tells me the notations
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.660]   for this week and I'm just gonna go over those?
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.780]   Well, like, no, because you're gonna see those notations
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.740]   so much throughout the curriculum.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.460]   Just pick four or five and drill them until they're mastered.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.340]   And then- - And then get some more.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.020]   - Yeah, then get more and then get more.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.460]   So I would say the very first thing to do
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.780]   would be do flashcards,
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.540]   whether it's like a mental math kind of thing,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.060]   like addition, subtraction,
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.620]   or whether it's the new grammar,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.300]   like using the notation flashcards.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.500]   So I would do that first. - Okay, okay.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.860]   All right, you keep talking, you mentioned,
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.340]   and I have seen the front of the math map covers
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.620]   and I've heard people talking about, like at practicum,
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.780]   about the art of the math map
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.820]   and how you always have that conversation.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.620]   Talk to us about the art.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.580]   Do I have to use that thing?
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.500]   Do I really need to do the art?
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.300]   - I would say if you don't do anything else,
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.140]   you should do the art.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   - Ooh, talk about that. - Because it's the best part.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.540]   Even if you don't feel confident in the math lesson pages,
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.380]   if you just look at the art,
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.540]   I feel like it's restful, right?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.700]   You're just looking at a piece of art,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.460]   you're looking at the detail.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.900]   You can ask your student,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.860]   "Okay, is there anything on this page that you see
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.500]   "that would remind you of God?
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.180]   "Or is there anything on this page
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.540]   "that would remind you of a math topic?"
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.100]   And just see what kind of connections they can make.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.060]   And we don't have to give them any, right?
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.980]   We could just let them talk.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.660]   And so there's no preconceived conversation
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.500]   you have to have.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.860]   It's just whatever they come up with.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.540]   And I'll just tell you,
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.140]   so we've talked about how we've piloted
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.260]   for like four or five years.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.620]   And we use the same art every single year.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.540]   So you would think,
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.780]   "Oh, this conversation's gonna be the same."
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.820]   - Right, 30 pictures.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.420]   I mean, aren't we gonna run out of things to say?
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:25.100]   - Right, well, every year my kids say something different.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.220]   It's a different group of kids.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.620]   They're looking at the same art,
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.140]   but they don't have the same connections.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.660]   They come at it from a different experience, right?
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.060]   We all have different backgrounds.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.180]   We all have lots of different denominations, right?
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.740]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.940]   - We all have a different aspect.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.020]   And so we're bringing something different to the table.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.140]   I would even say, if you do it on Monday,
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.180]   you talk about the art with your family on Monday,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.500]   maybe do it again on Friday
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   and see if anything changed, right?
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.700]   Because now they've done
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.100]   some of the calculation pages in the middle.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.380]   Is there something else?
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.380]   And do they see another connection, right?
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.220]   - Wow.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.500]   - I think it's the most important.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.060]   I mean, honestly, you're finding connections
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.780]   'cause we want to see God in math.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.900]   And so we're starting with that art picture.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.260]   So I think that's the most important.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.100]   - Oh, wow.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.300]   That is so cool.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.100]   I like it that you brought out the whole idea,
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.580]   that conversation.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.580]   The conversation seems to be a real,
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   a thing that families really come to love
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.020]   about doing the Math Map together
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.220]   is that it initiates a lot of really good conversations.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.420]   And I can see that that piece of art
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.420]   would really call forth a lot of conversations
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.860]   that could go in a lot of different areas
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.020]   and a lot of different directions.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.540]   - And what I love about doing it in Challenge A
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.260]   is we kind of start the conversation,
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.740]   but then we want the kids to go home
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.140]   and continue to talk about it.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.260]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.180]   - Because I have had the opportunity
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.700]   to kind of present the gospel
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.820]   to some students in Challenge A.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.660]   - Oh, wow.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.340]   I'm 100% sure they had really heard the whole gospel, right?
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.180]   - Yeah.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.780]   - So there's so many opportunities
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.780]   to point our students back to God
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.500]   and then say, "Okay, now go ask your parents what they see."
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.420]   And then that way the conversation can continue.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.900]   - Yes, that is really cool.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.740]   All right.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.940]   So that's really good.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.820]   Those are practical things to do every day.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.740]   Practice some kind of flashcard,
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.140]   some kind of calculation or grammar.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   That's really good.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.540]   Do the art, look at it, have conversations.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.820]   That really primes the pump.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.060]   What am I supposed to do though when I get stuck?
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.700]   Say I am a parent and we read the instructions.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   We are tracing and we are copying
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.300]   and we are reading and tracing and copying.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.260]   But then my child asks me a question.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.580]   Well, what does this weird symbol mean?
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.060]   When will I ever see that?
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.580]   Or what will I do with that?
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.780]   And we don't know the answer.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   What do I do as a parent when I feel stuck or unsure?
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.900]   - Okay.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.540]   Well, there's lots of things,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.260]   lots of resources that we can use.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.060]   So the first thing I would say is the naturals,
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.420]   which that's like the five, six-year-old curriculum.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.220]   Sometimes if you're looking at it
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.460]   and you're copying and tracing,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.940]   sometimes answers to questions are in there.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.460]   Like sometimes you're copying a definition.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.340]   And then sometimes you can look at how a symbol
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.700]   is being used and you can kind of figure out
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.300]   how it's being used.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.860]   So I actually have told some of my Challenge A parents,
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.220]   print off the naturals and just use it as a resource.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.060]   Leave it beside your student.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.180]   If we're working on lesson, I think we just did lesson 10,
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.620]   print off the naturals, lesson 10,
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.260]   and let your student have it beside them
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.940]   while they're doing your complex,
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.340]   and just let them use it as a reference,
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.020]   'cause it could be helpful.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.220]   We can always use the solutions.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   And this is so tricky because people will say,
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.340]   well, that's cheating.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.380]   If I get out the solutions as cheating,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.940]   and I've said this so many times, it's kind of hilarious.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.740]   My kids hear it when I say it,
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.460]   is that obviously we've been cheating in Latin
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.380]   this whole time because we don't do Latin
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.220]   without the answer key.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.460]   - I know, right, because how will we know
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.380]   if we've really screwed it up?
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.660]   - Right, and I mean, honestly,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.060]   I think I've purchased three or four
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.860]   different answer keys for Latin.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.700]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.380]   - And so we have them out on the tables,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.300]   because there's, when you translate,
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.980]   there's, it can be translated in different ways.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.020]   So sometimes there's a little variety.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.860]   - Sure, sure.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.900]   - But using the solutions and working backwards sometimes
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.100]   can really help you understand what you're looking at.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.340]   - Yes, it shows you where,
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   something that seemed like a magic or a miracle
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.860]   was just hard work.
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.340]   It was just a connection you didn't see at first.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.340]   But when you go back, like when I tutored
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.820]   Challenge B for years and years,
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.420]   and when we got to the really hard proofs
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.700]   at the end of the formal logic,
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.660]   I would say if you're doing this without the answer key,
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.540]   you are doing it the hard way.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.500]   I mean, if you can't get it, I mean,
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.340]   I want you to try for 20 minutes.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.820]   I want you to try.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.580]   But if you can't get it, go look at the answer key
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.700]   and see if you can understand why that is the answer,
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:38.020]   because that will help you do it the front way next time.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:38.860]   - Right.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.420]   And speaking of Challenge B,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.780]   so many of those symbols in that logic book
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.580]   are in the Math Map.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.420]   - How cool is that?
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.220]   - If you've had a Challenge B student going through
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.780]   and you just download the naturals,
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.220]   you're like, "Oh, I know what this is.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   "I've seen it before."
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.020]   You know? - Uh-huh.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.900]   - So there's also, we have the companion.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.780]   The companion's an online resource
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.500]   that does have a glossary.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.660]   So you could look up some notations there
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.820]   if you wanted to do that. - Okay.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.140]   - And then another stuck is,
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.060]   you know how in Essentials we copy charts?
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.140]   - We can copy the solutions from our lesson pages.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.220]   And so think about this.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.660]   Like, let's say I'm a parent.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.940]   Let's say I work, right?
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.980]   And I'm not really gonna sit down with my student
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.100]   the entire time he does math.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.300]   So I'm gonna tell him,
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.940]   "Okay, this is what I want you to do.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.300]   "Pages one through four,
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.660]   "I just want you to copy the answers.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.220]   "Look at the answer key and just copy the answer.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.460]   "Put it in there.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.420]   "That's all I want you to do today.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.780]   "And then tomorrow, I want you to see
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.180]   "if you can do the next four pages by yourself."
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.460]   So what I've had my student do is,
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.740]   like, page one and page five are the same.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.260]   So if I copied page one yesterday
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.140]   and the same stuff I'm gonna see today on page five,
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.580]   maybe my student is like,
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.380]   "Oh, I saw this yesterday and I remember copying it.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.860]   "Now I know what to do."
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.060]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.540]   And that's what you meant about the repeating nature of it.
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:16.380]   They're gonna see the same information in the lesson.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.980]   It really is building.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.820]   - It is.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.860]   So like one, two, three, four are the first four, right?
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.980]   Then you've got five, six, seven, and eight.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.460]   So one and five are the same.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.060]   Two and six are the same.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.620]   Three and seven are the same.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.820]   Four and eight are the same.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.860]   And so it's that way all the way to page 16.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.300]   - I see the pattern there, Barb.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.580]   Okay.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.420]   - Yeah.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.260]   So that's, I mean, I feel like that's another,
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.220]   if you feel like you're stuck, right?
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.860]   Is that you can get out the answer key
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.140]   and just let them copy.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.180]   And then another thing too, just if you feel stuck,
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.420]   is instead of using, let's say you're using
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.900]   the complex domain for challenge A,
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.180]   and it's, "Oh, I feel like all they're doing
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.100]   "is just copying."
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.140]   Well, maybe I should go to a lower domain.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.020]   Maybe I should try fractions and just see
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.300]   if they can do any of that on their own.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.820]   - Huh, okay.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.660]   - There's so many different things that you can do.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.900]   You don't, like I said before about the freedom,
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.620]   like you have the freedom to move around different domains
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.460]   and all that.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.500]   And then if all else fails, come to the book club
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.900]   and ask Lee and Percy your question live.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.820]   - That is so good.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.500]   And that brings me to the last thing
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.740]   that I really wanted to ask about.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.180]   And you've mentioned these sprinkled
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.380]   through our conversation.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.300]   What are the support resources that are out there for us
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.980]   as we get used to this?
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   What support resources can we as parents avail ourselves of
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   as we get used to learning math classically?
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.100]   - So Shauna and I monitor this email address,
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.420]   themathmap@classicalconversations.com.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.300]   Anybody can email us there.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.700]   As a matter of fact, we've even gotten questions
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.820]   from people who don't go to CC.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.660]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.420]   - And they're like, "Hey, can we use the Math Map?"
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   And we're like, "Well, anybody can buy it, right?"
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.260]   - Yes.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.140]   - So anybody can email us there,
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.380]   whether you're a parent or a director,
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.260]   anybody can email us there.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.980]   We also have forums on CC Connected
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.260]   where parents and directors can ask questions there.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.820]   Inside the companion on the first four pages,
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.180]   Kirstie has added videos for the tops.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.700]   So if I still crave that didactic,
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.740]   like teach me, tell me what to do,
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.100]   I can go look at the tops of the first four pages
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.180]   of that booklet and she's got little videos
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.140]   that explain those problems at the top.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.020]   So that's another good resource.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.260]   - Okay.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.820]   - And then also inside the companion, it's clickable.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.740]   So all the pages, I can click on different pages,
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.620]   like I can click on the charts,
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.660]   I can click on the beginning two I pages
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.900]   that are like references and it gives me some extra helps.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.940]   - Okay.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.660]   - So there, and then obviously, like I said,
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.620]   the last thing is come to the book club.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.460]   - Yes.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.100]   - Listen to Kirstie, ask them directly.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.540]   And I mean, the last, I don't know,
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.980]   probably five book clubs,
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.180]   Kirstie stayed on an extra 30 minutes
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.380]   just to let people ask questions.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.540]   And she wants to make sure everybody
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.940]   gets their questions answered.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.340]   - Oh, that is so good.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.380]   So there's a ton of support for us.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.700]   If we really want to do it,
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.420]   but it's hard and we're anxious and we struggle
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.940]   or we have a question,
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:35.180]   there are lots of places for us to get help.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.300]   That's awesome.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   That is really awesome.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.980]   Thank you, Babs, so much.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.860]   I feel a lot better about helping my students
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.580]   learn from the Math Map and I feel a lot better.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.860]   I think all our listeners feel better
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.260]   about having other resources
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.300]   to help us make this transition.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.380]   I really, I really appreciate this.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.900]   Listeners, I hope that you have benefited
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.340]   and I hope that you will pass along
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.060]   the information that you've learned
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.100]   or maybe even pass along the link to this podcast
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.540]   to a friend who might be struggling
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:17.060]   with the whole idea of learning math classically.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.100]   And I know that you're busy
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.420]   and I know that as much as we all want
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.460]   to learn more about classical education
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.220]   and steep ourselves in the classical model,
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.460]   we get busy and sometimes as parents,
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.780]   we don't have a lot of extra time to read for ourselves.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.700]   So I want to let you know about something
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:43.700]   that you can listen to and get your classical ed built up.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:50.940]   We have got a way for you to hear
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:55.980]   some of our CC Catalog articles on audio.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.100]   We know life's busy and we don't want you to miss out
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.180]   on the great articles that are coming out
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.140]   in the 2025 Catalog.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.340]   Articles like "What is Classical Conversations?"
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.740]   "The Need for Community,"
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.380]   "The Skills to Love Your Neighbor."
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.620]   There are tons of articles that will equip you
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.940]   and encourage you no matter where you are
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.420]   on the homeschool journey.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.820]   You can download our audio versions
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.860]   of the articles from the Catalog
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.940]   and listen while you're in the car
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.460]   or mowing the grass or working out, whatever.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:36.860]   Listen wherever you stream podcasts.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.860]   You can search "Classical Conversations Catalog Podcast"
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:47.300]   or you can go to classicalconversations/catalog-articles.com.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:57.380]   Okay, that's classicalconversations/catalog-articles.com.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.380]   And we can all keep learning together.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.420]   Just like you learned about the Math Map from Babs today.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.740]   Babs, thank you so much for being with me.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.180]   I appreciate all your knowledge.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.540]   - Absolutely, it was fun.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.580]   - It was a good encouragement to all of us.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.340]   Listeners, I'll see you next week
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.460]   with some more equipping and encouraging.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.300]   Bye-bye.
