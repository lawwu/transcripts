[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   [Music]
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.880]   Our next question comes from Troy.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   Troy says, "Tracking deep work projects versus GTD projects, are your systems for tracking deep work,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.320]   such as quarterly/weekly planning, and for tracking GTD-style projects, i.e. Trello, exclusive?"
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.800]   All right, so it's a confusing question. Troy has a long elaboration which I won't read
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.440]   on air, but if you do read it, it clarifies what he's really asking about here. So what he's asking
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.920]   about is the connection between, let's say, weekly planning and quarterly planning and task capture
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.600]   and task organization. That are these completely independent or are they somehow mixed together,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.880]   at least in the productivity system I espouse? It's a good question. I see them as relatively
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:01.360]   independent. So you should have some sort of system where all of your obligations are written down,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.600]   a place where you can clarify them, a place where you can add extra information about them. I'm a
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.280]   big believer of that concept from David Allen that you should not be keeping track of things just in
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.640]   your head. I also think, by the way, here is an amendment to that. You should also be not keeping
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.320]   track of things just in an inbox. Get things as soon as you can out of your inbox into actual
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.280]   tasks. Because when you're looking at tasks on a task board or a task list, you can make sense of
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.960]   them, you can organize them, you can see them all at once, you can attach information to them.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.920]   It is a much less mentally taxing way of encountering your professional obligation
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.840]   landscape than looking through an inbox and just noticing old messages and trying to
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   remember what they imply. However, how you do this, how you organize these tasks, how you capture
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.200]   them, how you get them out of your head, I'm a little bit agnostic. I like task boards. That's
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   not a David Allen idea. His idea was list separated by context. So you put work in context. I like
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.360]   task boards where I have boards per role and columns per different statuses. I also like that
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.400]   modern task board software allows you to attach a lot of information to these virtual task cards.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.280]   But there's other people I know who use bullet journals, and they keep track of all their tasks
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   in a bullet journal. There was a time when I was a grad student early on at MIT where I had paper
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.440]   notebooks. So I kept track of all my tasks on legal pads, and it would cross them off. And so
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   I don't really care. You just need some way to get that out of your head. Then we shift over to the
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.840]   other part of my productivity system, which is the multi scale planning where you have a quarterly
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   plan that lays out your vision for the quarter. This quarterly plan usually contains a more stable
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   vision. So here's my vision. That's pretty stable. Here's how I'm going to make progress on that
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000]   vision this quarter. Each week, you used a quarterly plan to make a weekly plan. Each day,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.080]   you look at your weekly plan and your calendar to build a reasonable daily plan, preferably
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.360]   using time blocking. This is, as Troy points out, kind of a separate thing. In theory, you could be
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.160]   terrible about task and task systems. You could have a vendetta against David Allen. You could
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.240]   say, I want to keep track of everything in my head, my inboxes, my friend. If someone needs something
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   for me, they'll bother me enough times on Slack that'll answer them. And you could still run the
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   other part of my system, you could still run the multi scale planning and get the benefits of it.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.760]   So they are pretty independent. I like to combine them because I don't want the stress of keeping
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560]   track of task my heads, I don't want to forget things, I don't want to waste time. So in my
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   implementation, when I'm working on weekly plans, and daily plans, I'm looking at those systems to
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.800]   see what's on my plate. But yeah, in theory, these are independent entities that exist without each
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.760]   other, you could, on the other hand, just have a good David Allen task system, but no multi scale
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.160]   planning. And that's reasonable as well, you're not gonna be making good progress on long term
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.320]   goals, you're going to be much more haphazard in your work, you're gonna be much more reactive,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.400]   but it's logically feasible. So these are two separate things. They both have benefits.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.000]   But when you do them both, I think you get a really good productivity consilience.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:17.520]   And what you're able to accomplish becomes a lot better.
