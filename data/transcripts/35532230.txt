[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.000]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.100]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.560]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.600]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.940]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.120]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.220]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.540]   I believe you will enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.780]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.180]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.860]   you will find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.380]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.780]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860]   Well, listeners, I'm excited about this episode
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.460]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.300]   I have a great couple to introduce you to,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.420]   and a wonderful organization to make you aware of.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.060]   The Classical Learning Cohort has been a blessing
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.300]   to parents for several years now.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.660]   And the ways that it has blessed families
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.540]   by helping those parents and tutors and directors
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.220]   feel like they are learning more and more
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.860]   about the classical skills.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.340]   They are becoming better classical learners
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.860]   so that they can pass on the skills of learning
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.140]   to their students and to their children.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.140]   So I wanna introduce you to John and Rebecca Saw.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.940]   They are going to give us an up-close and personal look
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.500]   at the Classical Learning Cohort.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.540]   Guys, I'm so happy to have you today.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.020]   - Thank you. - Well, thank you.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.020]   - Rebecca, you actually work for Classical Conversations,
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.540]   and so you are, some people might say,
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.820]   "Oh, well, Rebecca's paid to know all about the CLC."
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.380]   So I wanna acknowledge that right up front.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.500]   Tell us a little bit, Rebecca, about what you do.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.520]   - Yes, so I am called
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.220]   the Classical Learning Cohort Support Specialist,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.220]   and so what that looks like daily is I support mentors,
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.380]   I help coach them, I also communicate regularly
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.520]   to people who are interested in the cohort
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.020]   and speak with them about what it provides
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.340]   and how it might help fit their needs,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.340]   and then I hire and train new mentors
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.540]   to set them up for success.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.540]   And then each year, I plan and host a retreat
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.060]   with the mentors for anyone who has ever taken
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.260]   at least one semester of a cohort,
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.600]   they are invited to come to that,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.780]   and we feast together, we have fun together,
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.260]   we fellowship, we do lessons
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.140]   on things outside of academic content,
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.980]   we read a book together and discuss it,
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.260]   and we celebrate our graduates.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.700]   - Man, that is a lot of good stuff.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.060]   Okay, I heard a bunch of things in there
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420]   that I want to be sure that we come back
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.300]   and touch on during the podcast together,
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.740]   and I know that you will.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.420]   Mentors, retreat, and cohort,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.260]   those are three of the big things that you mentioned
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.620]   that I know I have some questions about
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.700]   and I suspect my listeners have questions about too.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.740]   I know that a lot of that is gonna come out
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.520]   as we continue our discussion.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.500]   I want to start at the very beginning with you, Rebecca.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.020]   Do you remember when you heard
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.460]   about the Classical Learning Cohort
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.800]   for the first time ever, you personally?
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.760]   What intrigued you when you first heard about it?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.940]   - Well, I joined the cohort
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.260]   when I was an academics advisor for Challenge A,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.220]   and so it was part of my continuing education
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.140]   and growth in classical Christian pedagogy.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.740]   And I was intrigued, honestly,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.860]   by the warmth and hospitality of my mentor.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.140]   I really didn't know what to expect,
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.980]   but when she brought me in and got to know me
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.380]   and established a relationship with me,
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.700]   and also just all of the amazing parents
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.460]   that I met from all around the world that do CC,
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.180]   I was so inspired by my interactions with them.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.460]   - That's really cool.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.300]   The whole, you were pulled in
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.380]   by what you might be able to learn
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.320]   and how you might equip yourself,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.500]   but you stayed because of the community.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.380]   I think that happens to a lot of us.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.680]   So, John, I discovered that you are also
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.080]   a Classical Learning Cohort person.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.580]   How did you hear about the CLC for the first time
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.900]   and what pulled you in?
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.760]   - Yes, so when I first started hearing about it,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.740]   I just assumed that Rebecca needed to take
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.740]   this extra class to be a better challenge director.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.640]   But when she became a mentor and started leading the cohorts
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.000]   was when I started to be more intrigued.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   She would explain how her cohorts went
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.780]   and describe what conversations were happening.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.500]   And I joined because I had just finished
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.180]   being a Challenge IV director, and I knew I needed help.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.700]   I wanted to be better prepared
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.500]   in case I was asked to be a director again.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.420]   - That's kind of cool.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.900]   I like it that you got intrigued
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.380]   by what Rebecca was doing with the people she worked with,
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.780]   and you saw some value in it for yourself.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.940]   I love that.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.940]   So you both joined for your own reasons,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.660]   but you were hoping to learn something.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.660]   What was it that you hoped you would learn with the CLC?
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.020]   How did you think, John, you've said you really thought
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.740]   it would help you to be a better Challenge IV tutor,
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.980]   a better conversation leader.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.260]   Were you right?
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.580]   What did you hope to learn
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.820]   and how did you think it would help?
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.100]   And were you right, John?
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.940]   - Yes.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.940]   So I wanted the cohort to help me ask better questions
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.300]   and guiding the conversations in a challenge class.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.100]   And I thought it would help me by being more immersed
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.900]   in the five common topics and the canons of rhetoric.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.900]   I knew about them, but wasn't comfortable in applying them.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.780]   And the cohort gave me space to have conversations
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.580]   about them and to practice them through my lesson planning
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.440]   and through receiving and giving assessments.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.020]   - That's great.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.860]   That's great.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.820]   I know, you know, in our classical circles,
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.420]   we throw around these 15 skills a lot.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.060]   You know, we throw around the naming, attending,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.140]   memorizing, expressing, storytelling,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.620]   or the names in the five core habits.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.380]   And then we throw around, oh, we want to get very immersed
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.820]   in the five common topics.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.100]   So Rebecca, help us remember,
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.220]   what are the five common topics?
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.460]   - Yes, so that would be definition, comparison,
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.460]   circumstance, relationship, and testimony or authority.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.420]   - Yes.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.700]   And what's the whole purpose of the five common topics?
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.500]   I know a lot of people who can say,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.380]   oh yeah, I know about the five common topics
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.780]   and they can rattle off the names.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.220]   And then somebody will say to them,
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.980]   what's the good of knowing that?
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.540]   And then they're stumped.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.700]   - Well, I think what we've learned
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.300]   is that having a classical conversation
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.140]   is really helping someone else
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.940]   discover truth for themselves.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.140]   I can tell you things all day long,
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.980]   but in order for it to become a part of you
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.260]   and for you to be on your own learning journey,
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.740]   I need to know how to ask good questions
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.180]   to get that out of you.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.780]   - So that's perfect.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.780]   So these five common topics are ways of asking questions
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.860]   that allow somebody to begin the journey of exploration
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.380]   about that topic, no matter what it is.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.340]   - Yes.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.500]   - That is super cool.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.340]   That is super cool.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.620]   Yeah, John, I can see how that would help you.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.380]   As a tutor, as a director,
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.380]   it would help you to ask your students better questions
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.860]   that would help them delve more deeply into a subject
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.980]   and kind of build their own understanding.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.660]   That's really good.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.580]   That's really good.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.180]   I like it that you said the cohort helped you
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.180]   have the space to have conversations about these skills
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.740]   and get more comfortable with them
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.220]   and gave you time to think about how to use them
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.580]   in your lesson planning.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.740]   - That's correct.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.620]   - Rebecca, what about you?
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.580]   What did you hope?
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.620]   I know you said you got involved as a way
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.060]   to do continuing ed when you were an academic advisor.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.020]   How did you think it would help you?
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.500]   And were you right?
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.340]   - Yeah, so I think for me,
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.900]   I was hoping it would help me invite a learner
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.500]   who was apprehensive or frustrated in their learning
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.140]   into a conversation,
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.460]   because that would happen sometimes at home
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   and that would happen sometimes in community.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.860]   And my heart is really to help others
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.900]   be able to reach and connect with their students.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   So for instance, if I'm teaching a focus lesson
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.540]   about a particular topic to lead students
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.820]   to a particular answer,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.980]   such as how to translate a verb
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.860]   in second conjugation in Latin,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.580]   or perform stoichiometry in chemistry,
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.660]   or transpose a chord in music theory.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.620]   So the first step as a parent or a tutor
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.140]   is you have to learn how to do the concept yourself,
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.060]   which is classical.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.900]   And if people have gotten that far,
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.620]   like good job, mom and dad, that's amazing.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.980]   And you think like, that's it.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.460]   - Yes, yes, well, you have become a lifelong learner.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.580]   Maybe it's something that you didn't remember.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.540]   I can remember doing stoichiometry in chemistry
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.620]   and thinking, sitting at the table with my daughter,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.100]   thinking this is more chemistry than I did 30 years ago.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.900]   I don't actually want to be doing this,
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.060]   but by gosh, I'm gonna learn it with you.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.020]   - Right, so like that's the first step.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.060]   You actually have to be willing to learn it
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.380]   and dig in for yourself as a parent.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.460]   - Yeah.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.340]   - And then I think after that,
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.220]   many times like that's just as much energy
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.260]   as parents have like to give.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.900]   And so they're like, okay, I figured this out.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.180]   Come on kids, come to the table.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.660]   - Yes.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.540]   - I just need to tell you how to do this
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.740]   so that you can go do your homework
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.420]   and get your school done.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.820]   And in that moment, I realized
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.100]   I had stopped teaching classically.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.180]   So I had learned classically,
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.940]   but then I just wanted them to sit and listen to me,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.580]   you know, talk for however long
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.780]   about how to do this thing.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.100]   - Get it out.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.980]   - Right.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.380]   So the cohort mentors show you
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.740]   how to help someone else learn anything
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.500]   in any program, in any age through a conversation
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.180]   where you are attending to what the human in front of you
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.260]   is or is not understanding every step of the way
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.820]   until the very end
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.540]   where they can actually explain it back to you.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.820]   And it just reminds me of the way Christ walks alongside us
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.980]   and that's how the mentors
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.900]   want to walk alongside our learners.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.460]   - This is really beautiful.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.900]   And I appreciate so much what you have said.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.820]   I don't want any of my listeners,
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.260]   'cause this happened to me when Rebecca was talking,
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.220]   I had a, yes, I'm doing it, I did that, I did that.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.540]   And then you got to the part where you said,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.540]   you've just stopped teaching classically.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.980]   And I went, oh, 'cause that's me too.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.020]   That was me a lot of times.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.340]   I was very, especially in my early years,
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.740]   I was very, after I knew what classical education
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.220]   was all about and I was committed to it,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.300]   I was very eager to reclaim my own education.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.260]   And I did a good job of getting down
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.620]   and learning the grammar
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.380]   and then putting the pieces together
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.180]   so that I could solve a problem
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.820]   or create something beautiful
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.300]   or pass it on to somebody else.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.620]   But a lot of times I did find myself
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.620]   just telling my kids what I had learned
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   instead of asking questions of them
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.420]   to discover where they were.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.940]   So listeners, if you think,
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.140]   yep, that's where I fell off the wagon too,
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.140]   don't despair and don't stay off the wagon.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.220]   Rebecca and John are helping us see
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.220]   how the classical learning cohort allows us
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.620]   to stay on the classical learning wagon
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.300]   and ride it all the way to the end.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.820]   I love, love, love what you said.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.500]   The mentors show you how to help somebody else
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.300]   learn anything through conversation.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.180]   And that is beautiful
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.060]   because that is education through relationship.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.700]   And I personally believe that is the most powerful
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.340]   kind of education we have.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.540]   Yeah, okay, so let's get down.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.420]   You have whetted all of our appetites
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.620]   for this thing that sounds absolutely amazing.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.980]   And you have made it seem like something
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.900]   regular people can do.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.700]   So tell us how it works.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.180]   How does the classical learning cohort work?
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.700]   I mean, is it in person?
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.660]   Is it online?
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.820]   Do we learn from a book, from a group?
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.220]   You mentioned mentors and cohorts.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.140]   I have lots of questions.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.940]   So Rebecca, walk us through.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.780]   How do you join and when does it start?
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.580]   What does it look like?
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.540]   Okay, yes, so right now it's online.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.020]   Each cohort has one mentor and up to six members.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.340]   And these are all members that are part of CC
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.420]   anywhere around the world.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.860]   We have hopes to be in person one day
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.900]   where our mentors live.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.540]   And registration is located in the bookstore,
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.060]   the CC bookstore.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.460]   And it happens twice a year in fall and spring.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.220]   Okay, so that makes me think it's like a semester long.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.940]   Each cohort is a semester long, is that true?
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.540]   Yes, it lasts within a semester.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.780]   It is six meetings and they're each two hours long.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.660]   So you sign up for a day in time
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.700]   and then six of those dates in the semester
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.220]   you'll be meeting with your group.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.140]   Okay, and it's online.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.260]   And how do you, I mean, do you read something
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.620]   and then talk about it?
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.340]   Do you read when you're together online?
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.900]   Is there studying involved in between the meetings?
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.060]   How do you prepare?
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.660]   And how do you sharpen one another
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.340]   when you're online together?
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.700]   Well, when we're online together,
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.820]   we spend time discussing teaching,
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.020]   hospitality or assessment.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:37.020]   And there is an online platform that you become part of.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:44.660]   And so within that, there are videos,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.220]   there are resources and worksheets
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.420]   and things to help you to prepare your lessons
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.900]   and to present.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.740]   And then during the cohort,
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.620]   also the mentor will model lessons to you
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.540]   and then you will bring two of your own every semester
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   and present those.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.260]   And then afterwards,
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.780]   the mentor will give you a live assessment
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.540]   of what you did well and what you could improve.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   And then the members will also give written assessment.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.540]   And so what happens is you're just in a very unusual place
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.700]   where you're with six other adults
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.660]   that are all doing the same thing you're doing
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.140]   at their home and in community
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.540]   and they're giving you adult valuable feedback.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.460]   So you grow very fast in a short, intense amount of time.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.100]   - It's like on the job training.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.900]   'Cause you said, Peep,
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.500]   these are folks that are part of classical conversations
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.540]   all around the world.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.540]   So you are choosing a lesson that you want to teach
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.540]   when it's your turn?
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.940]   - Yep, it's anything that you're doing at home
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.820]   with your kids or in community if you're a leader.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.380]   So we don't want you to spend extra time
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.460]   planning something that you're not gonna use.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.100]   You're actually doing exactly what you're doing at home
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.980]   and using them.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.580]   - Oh, that is so good.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.380]   Yeah, because that means that I am, like you said,
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.940]   not taking extra time,
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.500]   but I'm getting better
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.940]   at what I'm already immersing myself in.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.980]   - Exactly.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.900]   I love that.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.620]   And I'm already obviously very motivated to do it
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.540]   'cause I'm already doing it.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.100]   And the cohort is just gonna help me get better at it.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.740]   So does the mentor model the lesson first
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.740]   so that us cohort members get an idea
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.340]   of what we're shooting for?
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.820]   - Yes, we'll actually model lessons in every meeting.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.820]   So you're constantly seeing lessons in different strands
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.460]   and you are also learning some aspect
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.500]   of teaching and pedagogy each time.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.060]   So very similar to other things in our program,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.740]   it's like easy plus one.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.820]   So each meeting you're also learning one more new thing
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.940]   to add to your lesson.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.980]   - And I absolutely love that you said
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.100]   you spend time talking about teaching,
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.980]   which yeah, we could all have figured that out.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.220]   The classical learning cohort is gonna teach me
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.020]   how to be a better teacher of my children.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.140]   But also you said hospitality and assessment.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.860]   And I have talked to enough members of CLC
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.860]   and enough mentors even of CLC groups
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.660]   that I know that hospitality and assessment training
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.660]   is super important and maybe not the most obvious part
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.660]   of what participants gain.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.780]   - Yes.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.620]   - I just love that.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.980]   I think that's gonna be really great.
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.700]   John, from your perspective now,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.340]   I know Rebecca, you have been a mentor.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.180]   John, have you been a mentor before or just a cohort member?
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.980]   - Just a cohort member.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.100]   - So what did you feel like you did
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.060]   when you got involved in the cohort?
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.140]   What do you do?
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.100]   What did you do as a member?
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   - So for me, it was mainly about having conversations.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.940]   - Yeah.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.500]   - So being more of an introvert,
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.620]   having an engaging conversation
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.980]   has been the most surprising aspect of the cohort
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.900]   in which frankly, I've missed the most.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.460]   So the conversations can be about ideas or concepts,
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.740]   but they feed off of each other's experiences
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.100]   and perspectives.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.780]   So learning to listen was another aspect of the cohort
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.900]   that I learned anew.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.020]   - That's really cool.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.980]   I think that for a lot of us,
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.780]   listening is way harder than talking.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.300]   And so anything that helps us, I think,
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.380]   be better listeners will make us more valuable
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.540]   to our families and to our students
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.140]   and to our churches and to our communities.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.980]   I love that.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   Did you find, John, that participation in the cohort,
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.820]   I don't want to say helped you overcome being an introvert
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.300]   'cause I don't really think it's something
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.980]   that you need to overcome,
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   but did it help you as an introvert be more comfortable
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.940]   with different kinds of conversations?
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.720]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.660]   Yeah, I would say it definitely opened me up
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:48.660]   to be ready to engage,
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.860]   not to sit back and just listen.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.220]   And the mentors would not allow me just to sit back.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.540]   - To fade into the woodwork.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.540]   - They call you out, they call you by name,
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.540]   they make sure everybody's engaged.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.740]   - Well, I think that's really good
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.420]   because it is easy for talkative people to take over
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.260]   and for people who have ideas,
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.020]   but not a lot of extrovert tendencies
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.780]   to sink back into the background
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.440]   and their ideas don't ever get the play that they deserve.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.900]   I love it.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.860]   So I know that for classical conversations,
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.580]   the three things that people everywhere know about CC
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.540]   is that we are a classical education company,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.540]   we are a Christian education company,
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.500]   and that community is super important to us.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.700]   So how would you say, John,
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.820]   how would you say that the classical learning cohort
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.120]   is Christian?
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.060]   - So I would say that we use Jesus' example
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.660]   of using questions to reveal truths about himself
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.260]   and his disciples.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.100]   - Yeah.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.540]   - A prime example would be Matthew 16,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.280]   verses 13 through 15, where he asks,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.420]   "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.500]   And then he follows that warmup question
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.780]   by asking a more pointed question,
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.980]   "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.520]   So ultimately we're using Jesus' example of using questions
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.000]   to reveal truths about ourselves and him.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.180]   - That's really good.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.660]   That is really good.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.100]   Jesus was a super good question asker
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.860]   and he asked questions that went right
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.960]   to the heart of the matter.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.260]   And the thing I love about Jesus and his stories,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.300]   when he starts asking questions of people,
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.960]   he starts kind of way out and he just,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.800]   it's not that he's lulling people in,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.780]   but he draws people in and then there's the question
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.540]   that goes to the heart of the matter.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.420]   And so I love that, that the CLC helps us
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.140]   to ask good questions that, I love what you said,
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.840]   it reveals truths about ourselves and about the Lord also.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.540]   So Rebecca, let me throw the classical ball to you.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.660]   How is the CLC, how can you see
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.660]   the classical learning cohort being classical in nature?
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.380]   - Yeah, well, when I was thinking about this
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.620]   and things that are classical always come in threes.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.660]   - Oh my goodness, yes.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.580]   - So I think I like to share three ways
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.580]   that it is classical.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.580]   The first is that we learn how we can use the 15 skills
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.620]   like you alluded to before,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.160]   to teach through asking questions.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.220]   The mentors model lessons by asking questions
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.700]   to lead their learners on an adventure of discovery
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.260]   rather than listening to a boring lecture,
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.900]   which is what some of our experiences
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.940]   might've been in the past in education.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.100]   So you're in a live conversation,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.300]   experiencing what it's like to learn
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.180]   through a conversation actively
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.720]   rather than listening to a video or a lecture passively.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.860]   - Yeah, yeah, that's just beautiful.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.620]   I love that adventure of discovery.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.460]   And that's what it is when somebody invites you
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.840]   to take part instead of just expecting you to listen
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.180]   as they ramble on.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.700]   - Mm-hmm, yes.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:45.780]   Secondly, so the mentors show you what to do
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.900]   and then we give you an opportunity to do it yourself.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.260]   So another part of our time together
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.380]   is giving members a space to actually practice
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.320]   what they've learned through leading their own lessons
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   that they've brought and then navigating and responding
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.960]   to the people before them, right?
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.000]   So it's not just they show up
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.480]   and because they're not lecturing the whole time,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.840]   they've come with questions.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.440]   They don't know what people are going to say.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   So part of that is learning how to navigate
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.300]   and respond to those answers to continue
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.260]   to guide those humans in front of them
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.840]   to the one needful thing that they brought
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   and that they're hoping that they'll discover
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.600]   in their conversation.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.440]   - I love that.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.840]   So it really is a guiding discussion on the fly
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.880]   'cause like you said,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.640]   you don't know what somebody's gonna ask you
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.080]   and so you have to be always ready
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.400]   to deal with who's in front of you.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.040]   - Mm-hmm, yes.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.360]   And the third way is you practice giving
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.260]   and receiving hospitable assessment to other adults,
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.680]   which sadly is a lost skill in our culture today.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.080]   You have a mentor who sees you as valuable
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.880]   and able of doing the task before you
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.080]   and they showed up to help build your confidence
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.720]   and help you grow so that when you get off the cohort,
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.480]   which was John and I's experience and return to your family,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.740]   you really have been refreshed
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.080]   and encouraged to stay in the game,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   stay in homeschooling a few more weeks
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.200]   or a few more months
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.720]   and can truly experience the joy of learning again
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.560]   with your family,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   which I think is what we are all after.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.840]   - Yeah, that equipping that leads you to be so encouraged
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.280]   that you're inspired to keep going.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.940]   I think that's really great.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.440]   It's a good, good, good.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.600]   It builds community.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.400]   So talk about community.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.760]   - Yes, so how community comes in
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   is we are sharing experiences of homeschool parents
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.160]   all doing the same program wherever we live
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.420]   and having the same shared struggle, for instance,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:07.160]   of science fair or mock trial or debate or Latin.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.600]   - That's so good.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.840]   - Yeah, so we have that in the meeting,
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.880]   but also outside of the meeting,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.160]   there's an online discussion forum
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.560]   where you can share resources with each other,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.560]   ask questions about anything in your homeschooling journey
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.400]   and receive feedback from the wisdom
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   and experience of the members,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.060]   but also of your experienced mentor.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.480]   - Such, that's an awesome support network.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.520]   I can remember years ago, speaking at practicums,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.480]   I would say to people, look around at this big group.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.320]   The truth is, as long as we don't all have a bad day,
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.260]   on the same day, we can all keep going.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.640]   Rebecca, I know when I first asked you
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.280]   about talking to me about the CLC,
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.840]   you said, what if I bring my husband too?
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.680]   And I was surprised.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.640]   How did you get your husband to join the CLC?
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.480]   Are there many other dads or homeschooling dads involved?
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   - Actually, she didn't try to convince me to join.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.320]   - Yay.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.600]   - She had just told me in passing
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.840]   that she thought the cohort
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.680]   would help me be a better director
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.000]   and help me lead Bible studies better.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.120]   And so I didn't even tell Rebecca
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.680]   that I was joining the cohort.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.920]   It might've been that I wanted to surprise her,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   but it was more likely that I just forgot to tell her.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   And she found out about me joining from her friend
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.500]   who oversaw the registration process.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.900]   - I was gonna ask you, Rebecca,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.060]   what was the biggest surprise about what you've learned,
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.340]   but maybe your biggest surprise
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.620]   was that John was in on it too.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.740]   - Yeah, she texted me,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.420]   "Hey, did you know your husband joined the cohort?"
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.260]   I'm like, what?
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.100]   - You're like, what?
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.260]   - What are you talking about?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.580]   - That's so great.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.100]   That is so great.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.540]   So I know that you are both aware of what you could gain
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.660]   and you had expectations and hopes for what you would learn.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.260]   But I also know that after people get involved in things,
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.940]   a lot of times there are surprise benefits
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.020]   or happy surprises.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.800]   Rebecca, tell me, well, let me start with John.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.540]   What's been the biggest surprise?
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:28.900]   - The biggest surprise for me was that there was a form,
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.520]   a method to preparing a lesson and presenting the lesson.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.900]   And so there's a method to guiding the students
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.900]   by having a conversation through asking questions.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.660]   And so it wasn't anything that I had to come up on my own,
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660]   that there's a help in preparing lessons.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:59.320]   And another surprise to me was how useful comparison can be
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:05.100]   to spark that aha moment in myself and the learners.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.320]   Sometimes comparison is needed to find that truth
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.060]   when other skills might not reveal that.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.860]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.500]   And I think that we don't always recognize
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.220]   how these skills of learning can lead us deeper.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.620]   And so, yeah, what a blessing to learn that comparison
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.220]   would really bring the aha even for you.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.680]   Any other bonuses for you?
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.980]   - The bonus for me was how I saw the value of assessment
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.700]   in my own growth.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.780]   I never imagined that I would come to value assessment.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.740]   - Yeah.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.660]   - But I had to come to realization that assessment
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.260]   is different from criticism,
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.420]   that it's actually a learning skill.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.580]   - And you know, I think for a lot of us,
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.900]   that could be the biggest thing that we learn,
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.300]   that assessment is different than criticism.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.340]   And that assessment is about helping us to grow.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.260]   And so I really appreciate that comment, John.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.140]   That's something I think that a lot of my listeners
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.340]   would enjoy pursuing.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.620]   So Rebecca, what about you?
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.620]   What's your biggest surprise?
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:34.020]   - Well, I will try to hold it together and not cry.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.740]   I think the most rewarding aspect
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.060]   that I have had as a mentor
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.660]   is seeing parents who really wanted homeschooling
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.780]   to be beautiful.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.980]   And when it wasn't working at home,
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.100]   they assumed that it was something they were doing wrong
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.460]   or something was wrong with the curriculum
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.300]   or something was wrong with their kids.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.100]   And, you know, that is a really vulnerable place to be.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.340]   And I have been there.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.100]   - It's a disheartening place.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.260]   It really is.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.460]   - Yes, and you're trying so hard
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.740]   and you just feel like it's not working.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.180]   And so when I saw the impact that hospitality played
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.980]   in transforming the interactions
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.780]   that they had with their kids
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.060]   in such a way that they would come back and say,
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.980]   "We're having fun learning again."
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.620]   And they're understanding what we're learning.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.940]   And, you know, we're not crying
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.940]   and getting into arguments, you know, over learning.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.260]   And so just hearing stories
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.820]   of how the mentors nurtured the parents
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.580]   and how that experience strengthened
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.380]   and nourished their relationships
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.980]   and discipleship of their own children
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.580]   is definitely the most fulfilling part of my job
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.900]   and our job as a mentor team.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.380]   - Yeah, that is beautiful.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.460]   I can already tell that I'm gonna want you to come back
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   and talk about hospitality.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.020]   I think that what you've said there
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.100]   has really piqued my curiosity.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.540]   And I really do wonder if that's where a lot of us
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.860]   are having our dark days,
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.300]   is really not understanding the role
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.100]   of hospitality in homeschooling.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.220]   So did you just file that away?
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.540]   I'm gonna be coming back to knock on your door.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.980]   Talk to me about some bonuses that you got from the CLC.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.740]   - Yes, so John and I go on dates with all of our kids.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.340]   We have throughout their life.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.660]   We still do as adults.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:39.380]   And we would ask them these questions that we were learning
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.140]   of what are we doing well as parents
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.420]   and how can we improve?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.820]   And that was such a healthy
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.700]   and very humbling experience for all of us.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.340]   So what I never thought that I would hear from my kids
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.980]   is hearing that they had started implementing this
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.100]   in their dating and marriage relationships.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.660]   They would come home and say--
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.020]   - That's so cool.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.700]   - We did assessment tonight at our date.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.660]   - You did what?
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.620]   - Yeah, 'cause they would hear
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.620]   that John and I would do it on our dates
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.940]   and then we would do it with them.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.420]   And so that was so encouraging to hear
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.700]   how that was improving their relationships.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.340]   And it completely blew us away
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.220]   how transformative the CLC was going to be
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.100]   for all different aspects of our family.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.300]   - So that is really cool.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.940]   So listeners, I hope you're picking up
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.980]   what they're laying down.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.540]   It's not just about academics.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.420]   It will change the way that you interact
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.900]   in all your relationships and all of the environments
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.740]   in which you have relationships with people.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.900]   So how has your homeschooling changed
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.060]   as a result of your participation?
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.980]   John, what would you say?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.380]   How has your homeschooling changed?
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:03.660]   - So when I am helping our children
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.220]   in those few topics or subjects
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.820]   that Rebecca asked me to help,
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.460]   it was being more focused on the person
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.660]   rather than the subject matter.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.340]   So being a guy, I can be more result-oriented
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.020]   whether the students understand the material or not.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.700]   Rather, I had to learn to be more people-oriented
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.100]   and guide the students to discover the truth
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.620]   for themselves.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.620]   And so I believe, or I learned to believe
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.100]   the students retain the knowledge
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.420]   better if they discover the truth for themselves
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.660]   rather than me telling them the truth.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.260]   - That is so true.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.260]   I've seen that.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.060]   I'm sure we've all seen that.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.900]   The lessons that our children keep for life
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.540]   are the ones they learn themselves,
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.300]   not the ones we tell them about.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.820]   So that's beautiful.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.740]   That's very beautiful.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.540]   Rebecca, you were already a homeschooling mom of years
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.660]   when you joined the CLC.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.740]   So how did your homeschooling change?
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:12.300]   - Well, at home, I started asking my kids
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.220]   what they remembered about something
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.900]   and listening to know what they actually understood
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.980]   before I jumped into the new lesson.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.460]   What I had been doing was assuming
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.260]   that everything they had ever memorized
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.340]   or learned in their entire life
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.780]   was always at the forefront of their mind.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.580]   - Oh, right, because they should remember
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.020]   all the things we've ever told them.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.580]   - I would say, "Don't you remember this memory,
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.740]   history, fact, da-da-da-da-da?
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.220]   No, Mom, not right this second."
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.580]   - Yeah, right, and their eyes just kind of cross
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.940]   and they're like, "Yeah."
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.980]   - Right, I mean, by the time they're in high school,
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.420]   there is a lot of information in their brain.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.580]   And so just having, again, that hospitality
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.500]   in the moment of, "Let's just see what you do
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.860]   actually remember and understand today before we-"
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.860]   - "Where are we with this today?"
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.340]   - Right, exactly.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.820]   And then I think in community,
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.140]   it taught me that there was no situation
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:22.140]   that Christlike hospitality couldn't handle.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.060]   So tired students, unengaged students,
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.380]   talkative students, quiet students, difficult students.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.820]   It showed me that the power of moving
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.900]   towards students and parents in love like Christ
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.860]   to listen and care well for them
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.060]   covers a multitude of issues.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.660]   - Yeah, boy, that was a great lesson for all of us.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.140]   That would change our lives and all of our relationships.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.820]   That's really cool.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.300]   So you've mentioned using these tools
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.780]   that you really sharpened through the CLC
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.220]   in ways that go beyond schooling and homeschooling.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.700]   What other applications have you discovered
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.340]   for those skills, John?
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.460]   - So for me at home,
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.500]   Rebecca and I have used assessment to help our marriage grow
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.780]   and to draw closer to one another.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.740]   Assessment was a way of being vulnerable to one another
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.700]   in a safe and secure environment.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.540]   - Gotcha.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.540]   - So we can give and receive them now
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.580]   without feeling attacked.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.540]   - That's really cool.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.460]   That's huge to be able to give assessments
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.300]   instead of criticism and view that as a positive.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.060]   It would change a lot of marriages.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.700]   - And at work, I've used assessment tools
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.380]   in formulating the interview questions
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.820]   in the hiring process.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.740]   It has helped in assessing the strengths and weaknesses
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.860]   of the potential candidates.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.140]   Now I've also used them in evaluating employees
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.180]   and helping them to grow.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.020]   - Yeah.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.100]   - And that at church, at my church,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.420]   I use what I've learned specifically in mentoring
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.660]   the younger men in my community group.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.420]   - Yeah.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.020]   - It has helped in sparking deeper conversations
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.860]   that could prompt us to become more Christ-like.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.500]   - That's really beautiful.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.780]   It really goes hand in hand
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.980]   with what we've always said about classical education.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.420]   It's about integration.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:35.380]   It's not keeping a set of skills and tools for academics
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.340]   and a different set for life at home
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.580]   and a different set for life in the community
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.020]   and another set for how we act or think at church.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.940]   It's about integrating our whole lives
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:50.300]   around the pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.900]   and using the skills we have
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.660]   to build relationships everywhere.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.860]   So Rebecca, what about you?
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.020]   How have you used these skills
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.020]   that you've sharpened with CLC
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.380]   in ways that go beyond homeschooling?
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.540]   - Well, the skills of assessment, like John said,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.380]   they can also transfer to parenting life skills.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.380]   - Ah, very good.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.860]   The all-important life skills, yes.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.420]   - Right, so unloading the dishwasher,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.580]   teaching your children how to drive,
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.020]   helping them assess themselves
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.660]   as they're preparing or practicing for a speech
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.580]   or an essay before community day.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.460]   So just getting very comfortable with,
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.900]   so what do you think you did well?
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.140]   How do you think you could have improved that?
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.380]   Those are two really easy questions
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.580]   that you can ask about anything.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   - It's so great to give our kids those questions
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.380]   that they internalize
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.180]   and become habitual askers of themselves.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.260]   That's key.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.740]   - Yes, yes.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.780]   And then they start going and doing that.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.460]   As your kids get older,
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.420]   then they'll start going and doing that at their jobs
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.500]   and at different functions and activities
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.340]   that they do.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.860]   They'll be asking those questions of themselves
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.900]   at the end of a game or at the end of a practice.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.540]   And it literally does just become a part of them.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.740]   And what a healthy gift to give our kids
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.220]   before they're even adults
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.660]   to be able to do that for themselves.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.660]   And also when they're at work,
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.940]   when our kids would have assessment time
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.060]   with their employers,
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.780]   they would marvel that our kids wanted to know
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.740]   how to be better
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.220]   and were very comfortable with knowing
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.460]   that they had areas to continue to grow in.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.420]   - Yeah, and I think what it does is it shows people
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.500]   that we are interested in growing,
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   that we realize that God is always calling us onward
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.220]   and upward and that there's more to learn
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.860]   and more that He can teach us
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.100]   and more ways that we can be like Him.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.140]   And assessment, it just helps us to refine
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:11.060]   and polish off the rough edges.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.580]   We come closer and closer.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.820]   I think that's just a beautiful way to look at it.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.940]   Well, I can tell from talking to you guys
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.660]   that you would absolutely advocate
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.100]   that we all become CLC cohort members.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.780]   John, what would you do if somebody came up to you
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.060]   and said, I heard you're a member of that,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.140]   what do they call it, the CLC?
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.340]   Why should I do that?
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.700]   What would you say to them?
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.380]   - I would summarize it by saying,
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.260]   for me, I had joined the CLC thinking
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.060]   that it would help me become a more effective teacher.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.580]   But what I didn't realize was that it helped me
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.460]   become a better mentor to my wife and adult children,
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.580]   to young men in my church,
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   and the employees that are entrusted to me at work.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.580]   So ultimately, I think it helped me
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:09.580]   to become a better leader at home or church or work.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.300]   - That is beautiful.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.300]   That is beautiful.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.060]   You know, it reminds me that when we put our hearts
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.740]   and we put our will to learning something,
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.180]   that God multiplies the blessing of that.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:27.420]   And so I think it's beautiful that he has allowed
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.660]   these skills that you've learned to be useful
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.100]   in way more contexts than you may have thought
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.140]   at the beginning.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:39.980]   Okay, Rebecca, I know that since you work for CC
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.860]   with this classical learning cohort,
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.540]   you have to say these things.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.180]   But really, why would you tell us all
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.460]   that we need to join the CLC?
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.100]   - Well, I mean, I'm here because of what you have just heard.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.300]   I have the job I have because the CLC transformed
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.780]   our family and our life in such a way
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.940]   that I want to give my life's work
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.140]   to help others have this opportunity.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.860]   So it really is, that is why I'm here.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.220]   I think anyone should join the CLC.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.340]   I would say if you are a parent
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.300]   and you have no intention to ever be a tutor or director,
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.580]   but you just want to get better at homeschooling your kids,
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.780]   I would join.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.140]   What we've also found is that most of the time
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.820]   when people do that, by the end of their first semester,
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.500]   they're already ready to sign up.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.340]   They're like, "Yes, I can do this."
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.180]   - And it's fun.
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.740]   - Yes, yeah, it just breaks down so many barriers
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.220]   that keep people from joining leading and community.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.820]   So I would say it's for anyone.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.860]   It's also for the tutor or director
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.700]   that just wants to grow and become better at their craft.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   And also just to be mentored on your homeschool journey.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:08.540]   Homeschooling, like you said, it's amazing and wonderful.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.780]   And sometimes it's really hard
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.340]   and it can feel very isolating
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:17.620]   for you to have someone who their job is to mentor you,
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.060]   to pour into you and encourage you
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.740]   so that you can flourish to the finish
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.020]   and continue growing right alongside your children.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.380]   - That is awesome.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.700]   That's gonna make its way into the podcast description.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.300]   Flourish to the finish.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.500]   I love it.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.380]   All right, I think that you probably have thousands
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.940]   of listeners who are at least eager to find out more
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.940]   about the Classical Learning Cohort
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.780]   and when the next one starts and what do we have to do.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.460]   So Rebecca, as we bring our time together to a close,
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.700]   I wanna let you give us the how-tos, the next steps.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.140]   Where do we go to get more information
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.900]   and what would our next step be?
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.020]   Whether we just want to know a little bit more
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.500]   or we are really ready to pull the trigger.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.940]   - Okay, so yes, the next steps would be,
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.940]   our website is classicalconversations.com/cohort
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:20.660]   and there you will find FAQs and podcasts
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.300]   on each of our semesters of content.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.540]   You can also sign up for an experience,
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.060]   the Classical Learning Cohort,
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.220]   which is a one-hour information meeting
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.060]   where you learn more details about it
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.700]   and also get to experience a conversation
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.700]   where we have a lesson about a Bible passage
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.780]   and then also a lesson on academics
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.500]   and so you get to actually see
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.180]   what it's like to be in a cohort.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.300]   And then if you're ready to register,
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.980]   that is in the CC Bookstore.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.740]   So the website for that would be
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:01.740]   classicalconversationsbooks.com/pages/clc
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:06.740]   classicalconversationsbooks.com/pages/clc-events.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.060]   So that is where you actually go register
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.660]   and you'll see them listed by their content
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.740]   and the day and time that they are available,
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.380]   Monday through Friday morning, afternoon and evening,
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.700]   Eastern Standard Time.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.380]   And then if you have any other questions,
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:30.380]   you can always email us at cohort@classicalconversations.com.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.300]   - That is awesome.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.020]   That is really good intel for all of us.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:35.860]   Thank you guys.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.700]   Thank you, John.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.700]   Thank you, Rebecca for giving us this look into the CLC
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.100]   and for really wetting our appetites
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.780]   for what it could do for our homeschools,
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.100]   but also for our homes and our communities.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:56.100]   Thank you to Rebecca for the great contact information.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.300]   I'm sure that there are thousands of listeners
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.660]   who are reaching for their keypad now
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.420]   to see how to find out more information about this.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.620]   Listeners, you stay tuned.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.060]   I am gonna have these great folks back
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.460]   maybe to talk about some of the things
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.220]   that they alluded to in here.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.340]   The importance of hospitality,
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.060]   how to ask good questions,
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.300]   and what is it about assessment
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.180]   that should make my heart go pitter-pat instead of, oh no.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.020]   So you guys have a great day
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.060]   and continue to be everyday educators.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.900]   Bye-bye.
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.640]   you
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.700]   you
