[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.860]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from financial samurai and in this episode I want to talk about how homeowners can live for free
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.600]   So in the previous episode I talked about safe havens
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.820]   specifically buying three-month Treasury bills because they're yielding
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.480]   3.3 3.4 percent now and that's pretty darn good online savings accounts yielding a little bit over 2% APY
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.240]   Not bad if we're gonna go deeper into recession if you noticed
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.760]   Federal Express FedEx they reported disappointing results and removed their forward-looking guidance
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.520]   because
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   They think we're gonna go into a deeper recession
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   The CEO was quoted as saying he believes we're gonna go into a worldwide recession
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.320]   therefore focusing on your cash
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.600]   Your cash hoard and the return on your cash is probably really prudent right now
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680]   Over the next 6 to 12 months. I'm gonna be building my cash hoard
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.320]   Especially since it's gonna be receiving a higher interest rate and here's something else
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.800]   I just realized as my mind is going through this protective mode right now, you know, I'm father
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.640]   I've got to look after my wife and two children and my parents if need be and I'm all thinking about okay capital preservation
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.920]   I've thought about capital preservation ever since I left in 2012
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.360]   My net worth allocation has never been too extreme
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.200]   Never focused more than 50% in one asset class and never really chased
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.680]   The super hot high flyers just a little bit 5 to 10 percent of my investments, but now you know, it's serious, right?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.600]   We've had good times and we could go through rocky times for another one to two years
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.280]   It's very possible. So if you look at the yield curve right now, it is inverted
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.640]   It's inverted because the one year and two year
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   Bond yields are higher than the 10-year bond yield. The 10-year bond yield is around
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.680]   3.45%
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.840]   Maybe it tops out at 3 5 3 6. I'm not sure but I think that's about where it's gonna top out
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   But the one year one year Treasury bill is at three point nine five percent
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.040]   It's almost at four percent and similar with the two-year. So it's an inversion and
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200]   Inverted yield curves are a prescient indicator for a recession
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Almost four percent on a one-year Treasury bill is very attractive in my opinion
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   over 90% of homeowners with mortgages have a mortgage interest rate below 5% and
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.040]   about
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   56% of homeowners with a mortgage rate have a mortgage rate below 4%
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.220]   We've all been able to refinance to under 4% for our mortgage over the past three years right in
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.560]   2019
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   2020 2021
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.300]   We were bombarded with the message to refinance and I was telling y'all to refinance
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   I refinanced and I got a new mortgage in 2020
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.600]   So for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.480]   You should have been able to get three percent or less and for a 7-1 arm or a 10-1 arm or a 5-1 arm
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.840]   You should have been able to get two point five percent or less
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.120]   So as a result, I think it's very prudent to buy one year Treasury bills at about four percent
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.080]   This is the perfect arbitrage to allow you to live for free now
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   Obviously, you're not perfectly living for free if you don't have as much cash in those T bills
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.800]   Equal to your mortgage and other expenses other housing expenses, but as a personal finance enthusiast, it's all
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.320]   Incremental gains, right?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.400]   So if you have that ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand hundred thousand dollar lying around if you don't need that money
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.960]   Four percent on a one-year T bill
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.480]   Sounds pretty good. Now if you look at Ford Futures
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.280]   inflation expectation rates
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.760]   It's expected to go drop down to under four percent three and a half percent three percent in one year's time
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440]   But you don't really know right? Nobody really knows it does seem like inflation is peaking
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   But for now what we do know is you can get a four percent
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.280]   Guaranteed yield over a one-year time period further if you buy Treasury bonds or Treasury bills
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.240]   There is no state income tax. So if you live in California, New Jersey, New York Hawaii states with high
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   income tax rates
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.840]   Then you're getting an even better deal buying US Treasury bonds and bills as a financial samurai
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.760]   I always want you to be thinking about what are the positives of the current economic situation any
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.600]   Situation frankly, so the positive of an aggressive
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.240]   Fed rate hike policy is that the short end of the curve is going up and so we're going to be able to get higher
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.320]   Returns on our savings so we should absolutely take advantage while also being cognizant of
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.560]   Investing through a downturn, you know, I'm still nibbling on stocks when the S&P 500 is below
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.440]   3900 who knows where it could bottom the most recent bottom was around the 3600 level
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.680]   It could go there. It definitely could with all these indicators showing, you know, things are slowing down
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.960]   It's definitely a possibility what you obviously don't want to do is spend way more money than your income growth
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.240]   Projections. I mean this is what we're seeing at every single tier of income in the United States people are spending out
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.780]   Of their minds and I guess it's good for corporate profits for now
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.060]   However, if you're not anticipating a slowdown and you're still spending like this
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.760]   It's gonna come back and bite you in the bum bum
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.560]   So if you want to buy Treasury bills or bonds
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.800]   you can allocate a portion of your cash to them through Treasury Direct or through your online brokerage account and
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.000]   Finally, let me share a really nice podcast listener review as I'm thinking about how to best spend my time in
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.840]   2023 and these reviews are motivating and if there are no more reviews, it's okay
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   I'm gonna spend my time elsewhere and that's all good
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.280]   Payton Kolo said Sam I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your new book by this not that
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.480]   I've read a lot of financial books over the last five years and so far your book relates to the middle class
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.880]   Better than anyone when I started reading the book. It was hard to put down
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.660]   I know you were not excited about writing a book, but I am glad you did. I highly recommend the podcast and book
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.100]   Thank You Peyton so much for your kind review of the podcast and book
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.640]   What really makes me happy is that Peyton says I relate to the middle class better than anyone
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.500]   Because this was not always the case
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.740]   In fact a lot of listeners and a lot of readers over the years said I was simply out of touch with reality
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.780]   Because here I was living in San Francisco where the median home price is over
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.620]   1.8 million dollars and there are different types of incomes here where 22 year old kids
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.280]   College graduates are getting a hundred eighty thousand dollars all in right out of school
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.860]   But this is the reality that I've been living in from two years in New York City
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.480]   To now 20 years in San Francisco, and so I'm not gonna make things up
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.740]   I'm just sharing things the way they are and I've always hoped that people
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.940]   can recognize different realities that people experience in America and around the world and to just take it in and
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.980]   See if you can learn from different perspectives
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.740]   I think that's one of the funnest things about listening to a podcast
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:36.940]   Listening to people from different backgrounds and more during the two years of writing by this not that I was very
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.360]   intentional about writing for the middle class for the aspirational class for the people who cared
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.620]   Enough about their finances to read and listen about personal finance
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.720]   I wasn't just including stories about people making multiple six figures a year
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.180]   I was talking about people making $40,000 a year and close to the median household income of
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.980]   $75,000 a year. I wanted the book to be relatable and helpful to as many people as possible
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.060]   So thanks so much for listening reading leaving a great review
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.240]   They're all really helpful and motivating and thank you for letting me evolve and learn from all of you
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:21.160]   It really is an honor if you'd like to pick up a copy of by this not that you can go to financial samurai.com
