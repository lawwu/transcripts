[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So what concept or theorem in linear algebra
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   or in math you find most beautiful?
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.400]   That gives you pause that leaves you in awe?
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.040]   - Well, I'll stick with linear algebra here.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.680]   I hope the viewer knows that really,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.400]   mathematics is an amazing, amazing subject
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   and deep, deep connections between ideas
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.680]   that didn't look connected.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   Some, they turned out they were.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560]   But if we stick with linear algebra,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.760]   so we have a matrix, that's like the basic thing,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.640]   a rectangle of numbers and might be a rectangle of data.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.720]   You're probably gonna ask me later about data science
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.360]   where an often data comes in a matrix.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.920]   You have, you know, maybe every column corresponds
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.920]   to a drug and every row corresponds to a patient
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   and if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.160]   then you put up some positive number in there.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.200]   So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   You got a big, big set of numbers.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520]   And what are the patterns?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.600]   What's going on?
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   And so one of the ways to break down that matrix
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   into simple pieces is uses something called singular values.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   And that's come on as fundamental in the last,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440]   and certainly in my lifetime.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.000]   Eigenvalues, if you have viewers who've done engineering,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   math or basic linear algebra, eigenvalues were in there.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.200]   But those are restricted to square matrices
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.760]   and data comes in rectangular matrices.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   So you gotta take that next step.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   I'm always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.160]   do it, singular values.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   So those are a way to break,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   to find the important pieces of the matrix,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.920]   which add up to the whole matrix.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.080]   So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   And the first piece is the most important part of the data.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.160]   The second piece is the second most important part.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   And then often, so a data scientist will like,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.560]   if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.840]   stop there.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   The rest of the data is probably round off,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.640]   experimental error maybe.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.200]   So you're looking for the important part.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.040]   - So what do you find beautiful about singular values?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.280]   - Well, yeah, I didn't give the theorem.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.440]   So here's the idea of singular values.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square, whatever,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.720]   it can be written as a product of three very simple,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   special matrices.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.340]   So that's the theorem.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.240]   Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   which is just a matrix, a diagonal matrix,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.200]   otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   And then the third factor is another rotation.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So rotation, stretch, rotation is the breakup of any matrix.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.440]   - The structure of that, the ability that you can do that,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.880]   what do you find appealing?
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.080]   What do you find beautiful about it?
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.240]   - Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.360]   but everybody can visualize a rotation.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040]   Take two dimensional space and just turn it
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280]   around the center.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.760]   Take three dimensional space.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.240]   So a pilot has to know about, well, what are the three,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.860]   the yaw is one of them.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.760]   I've forgotten all the three turns that a pilot makes.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.460]   Up to 10 dimensions, you've got 10 ways to turn,
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.540]   but you can visualize a rotation.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.100]   Take the space and turn it, and you can visualize a stretch.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.100]   So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.080]   into something you can visualize,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.860]   rotate, stretch, rotate, is pretty neat.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.700]   - Yeah. - Pretty neat.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.940]   - That's pretty powerful.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.020]   (laughs)
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.140]   (SILENCE)
