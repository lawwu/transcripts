[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   Alright, so let's get started then with today's deep question.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800]   I'll word it this way.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.000]   How does fixed schedule productivity work and how has Cal's thoughts on it changed over
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   the years?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.200]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.780]   a distracted world.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.400]   I am here in the Summer HQ up in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.240]   I am joined down in the Southern Deep Work HQ in Washington, DC by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.960]   Jesse, do you think I've done a pretty good job setting up my Northern HQ to look not
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.020]   unlike our studio down in DC itself actually looks?
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.020]   I never had a doubt.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.000]   I knew you were going to pull it off.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It looks great.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.240]   Now, we still have some kinks we're working out.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.800]   You might hear a small hiss that should be gone by the next episode.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040]   I'm still playing with the lights, but there's nothing more fun than messing around with
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720]   AV equipment when what you really should be doing is actual deep work.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.000]   So I think there's irony there.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.680]   Working on a podcast about avoiding distraction has been in recent days a wonderful source
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.880]   of distraction for me.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.680]   But I am happy to be up here.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.560]   I'm happy that we are still rolling with the show.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.080]   Even as I'm up North, I'll tell you what I wanted to talk about today came from you,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   my listeners.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.480]   Someone sent me a question about an article that I had published back in 2008.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.800]   That's one of my classic articles.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   I think one of my most cited articles on hardcore productivity.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   Let me read the title.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   I have it here.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.120]   I love that 2008 article I wrote is as follows.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.560]   "Fixed Schedule Productivity.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.960]   How I Accomplish a Large Amount of Work in a Small Number of Work Hours."
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.880]   I thought it would be fun to revisit this article.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.640]   To talk through some of the main ideas, discuss what I still agree with, and what I have evolved
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.920]   or changed in the many years that have passed since I first wrote that.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.600]   Just to calibrate where this falls on the "deep life" stack we use to roughly keep
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.720]   track of efforts to find more depth in our life, this would be a core, calm layer strategy.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.560]   Fixed Schedule Productivity that I write about in this article will discuss really is all
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.040]   about how do you keep a control of your obligations so that you have breathing room and time to
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.960]   actually push other things towards the remarkable, reflect, etc.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.520]   So that's going to be the plan.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.600]   We're going to talk about that topic, get into the weeds here a little bit.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   Then I've pulled some questions that are all relevant.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.480]   Now some of the questions we're going to answer in this second segment are specifically
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.680]   related to Fixed Schedule Productivity, and some are related to the type of more smaller
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   or finer-tuned tactics you would need to succeed with Fixed Schedule Productivity.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.600]   So we'll do that in the second segment.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.820]   And for the third segment, we'll talk books.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.240]   This is coming to you, we're now at mid-July, so we might as well go back and talk about
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.600]   what books I read back in June.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.200]   All right, so let's get started then with today's deep question.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.440]   I'll word it this way.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.320]   How does Fixed Schedule Productivity work and how has Cal's thoughts on it changed over
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   the years?
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   I'm going to start by reading the introduction of my original article here.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Here's the introduction.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.160]   Remember, this is February of 2008 when I wrote this.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.880]   I was a PhD student at MIT at the time.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   Here's what I wrote.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.320]   "I should have an overwhelming, Malox-guzzling, stress-saturated schedule.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   Here's why.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.960]   I am a graduate student in a demanding program.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   I'm working on several research papers while also attempting to nail down some key ideas
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.320]   for my dissertation.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.440]   I'm TAing and taking courses.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.200]   I maintain this blog.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.920]   I'm a staff writer for Flack Magazine.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.080]   And to keep things interesting, I'm working on background research for a potential new
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   book project.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   It would be reasonable to assume that I must get on average 7-8 minutes of sleep at night.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.600]   It would also be wrong.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Let me explain."
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.920]   Alright, well, anyways, first of all, let me just react to that before we get into the
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.960]   guts of what I talk about in that article.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.920]   It's very nostalgic how naive I was to think that a grad student schedule was somehow demanding
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.400]   or Malox-guzzling or whatever I said there.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.520]   Here's what I didn't say.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.760]   Here's the thing of being a grad program.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.120]   Yeah, I'm working on several research papers and TAing.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   That doesn't take that much time.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.840]   You TA a class twice a week.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.680]   You can work on the research paper some days.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.240]   I'm also interested to see Flack Magazine reference.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.960]   I do not believe that magazine is still around.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.000]   It was, however, a key part of my development as a writer.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.280]   After I wrote the book, How to Become a Straight A Student, I began, as I've talked about on
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.760]   the show before, to systematically train my writing ability so that I could do more general
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.720]   journalism, general idea nonfiction writing like I do today.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.680]   Flack Magazine was a big part of that training.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.480]   It was a kind of M+1 style clone, sort of like hipster Brooklyn style publication, online
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.880]   only, and pretty competitive.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.360]   They had a good editor, right?
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.240]   It was hard to get them to accept an article.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.560]   And so I used Flack Magazine commissions to push my writing away from pure pragmatic nonfiction
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.080]   and to be a little bit more journalistic or general nonfiction.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.720]   So it's cool to see that Flack Magazine reference.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.520]   Alright, so how did I explain how I avoided stress in that situation?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.440]   Well, I go on to write in the article, "Here is my actual schedule.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.000]   I work from 9-5 on weekdays, in the morning on Sunday.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I'm bored.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.880]   I have no need to ever turn on a computer after 5 during the week or any time on Saturday.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.760]   I fill these times instead doing, well, whatever I want.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.840]   How do I balance an ambitious workload with an ambitiously sparse schedule?
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.560]   It's a simple idea I call fixed schedule productivity.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   The system works as follows.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.200]   One, choose a schedule of work hours that you think provides the ideal balance of effort
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.760]   and relaxation.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.480]   Two, do whatever it takes to avoid violating this schedule.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.520]   Alright so there it is.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   I'm introducing for the first time back in 2008 my now fabled fixed schedule productivity
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   system.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.840]   You fix the hours and then you say, "That's what I'm going to work."
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   Then you figure out how to make that happen.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.040]   And it's in that second part, figuring out how am I going to satisfy this commitment
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.560]   to myself, it's in that second part that the productivity innovation, the workload
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   management innovation, all of that will then emerge as a natural consequence.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.500]   Now again, a little bit of backstory here.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.060]   This idea of fixing the schedule to 9 to 5 was quite novel for a grad student.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.880]   So for me this seemed really very novel.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   Grad students usually roll into work 10, 11 a.m. and they often will stay there until
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.360]   late at night, especially if something is due the next day.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.840]   Because I got married early, I had always just fixed my graduate student hours to my
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.120]   wife's work hours.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.040]   And so I had this unusual structure early on in my grad student career.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080]   I'm going to stick to normal work hours.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.560]   I want to be done work when she gets done with work.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   And so this is the backstory of what led me to experimenting with fixed hours and working
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.440]   backwards to satisfy it.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.360]   Now again, as I say, this is not hard to satisfy for most graduate student positions, but it
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.060]   was great training wheels for me to get used to this idea of working backwards from limits
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.520]   and letting that induce innovations.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.200]   So as I go on to say in the original article, here is a simple truth.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.720]   To stick to your ideal schedule, you will require some drastic actions.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.160]   For example, you may have to dramatically cut back on the number of projects you are
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.440]   working on, ruthlessly cull inefficient habits from your daily schedule, risk mildly annoying
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.040]   or upsetting some people in exchange for large gains in time freedom, and stop procrastinating.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.600]   In the abstract, these all seem like hard things to do, but when you have the focus
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.400]   of a specific goal, such as "I do not want to work past 5 on weekdays," you'd be surprised
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.160]   by how much easier it becomes to deploy these strategies in your daily life.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:49.480]   I then go on to talk about what in 2008, what strategies I put in place to satisfy my fixed
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   schedule.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   I mention serializing projects.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.120]   I keep two project queues, one for my student projects and one for my writing projects.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.720]   At any one moment, I'm only working on the top project from each queue.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.040]   When I finish, I move on to the next.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.160]   A little bit of an aside, that wasn't really true.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.240]   I was often working on multiple research papers at the same time, but I think that sounded
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   better.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.840]   Number two, I'm ultra clear about when to expect results from me, and it's not always
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   soon.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   Number three, I refuse if my queue is too crowded for a potential project to get done
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   in time.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.720]   Number four, I drop projects and quit.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.680]   If a project is out of control and starts to set up too much time for my schedule, I
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.960]   drop it.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.160]   If something demonstrably more important comes along and it conflicts with something else
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.900]   in my queue, I drop the less important project.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.400]   If an obligation is taking up too much time, I quit.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.040]   Here's a secret, no one really cares what you do on the small scale.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   In the end, you're judged on your large scale list of important completions.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.480]   Again a backstory there, I remember very specifically a student organization I joined because I
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.920]   thought it would be interesting about the dialogue between science and religion.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.640]   And then I soon realized, I don't have time to do this.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.300]   I mean this is going to, I'm going to have to add extra work hours, I'm already at roughly
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.220]   my capacity, and I quickly backed back out of it.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.600]   I'm sure that's what I had in mind when I wrote that there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.640]   This is number one, two, three, number five, I'm not available.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.600]   I often work in hidden nooks of the various libraries on campus.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.480]   That's quite relevant in grad school, if you're in your office, people can find you.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   Number six, I batch and habitize.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.340]   Habit-itize, I think I made up that word.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.940]   Any regularly occurring work gets turned into a habit.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.760]   And number, what is this, seven, I start early, sometimes real early.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.380]   On certain projects that I know are important, I don't tolerate procrastination.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.380]   It doesn't interest me.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.300]   If I need to start something two or three weeks in advance so that my queue proceeds
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.520]   as needed, I do so.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.960]   All right, so we get a little bit of chest beating there.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   All right, so let's react to this.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:55.540]   That was 2008 Cal, explaining not just what fixed schedule productivity is, but how I
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.080]   actually implemented it.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.280]   And what I'd point out is, I was surprised by how similar a lot of that is to what I
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   still do today.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.140]   I probably had forgotten that that particular schedule, nine to five in the mornings on
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.240]   Sundays, was something that I was doing in 2008.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   I mean, I was doing in my twenties.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.120]   I didn't realize that went back that far.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.000]   All those ideas about being very careful about what I say yes to, spreading things out over
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.080]   time so that I don't have project deadlines piling up and requiring really long days or
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.560]   weeks, that's something I still do quite a bit.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.640]   Being in different locations where I'm hard to find, yes.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.720]   Risking mildly annoying people in the short term to get long-term, bigger gains, yes,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.120]   that is something else I do as well.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.520]   So a lot about this article holds up.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.200]   But I did want to look back and say, what is it that's new?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   So what's my new take?
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.440]   Or my new additions to this thinking?
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.320]   Well the first thing I want to add to it, 2023 Cal wants to add to this article, is
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.040]   I don't think I fully understood back then why fixed schedule productivity was so effective.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:15.480]   The way I talk about it in that article is that, oh, it is just a source of innovation.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.800]   If you have a simple goal that you can commit to, I don't want to work past five, that will
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.680]   lead you to innovate lots of smaller productivity habits.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.960]   You're going to track your time better.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.800]   You're going to be more careful about managing your project queues.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   You're going to have systems to automate certain things that can be automated.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.760]   So I saw it back in 2008.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.320]   This strategy was really about innovation.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.140]   I used to call it a meta productivity strategy because it induced many different concrete
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.240]   productivity innovations.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:51.480]   2023 Cal sees, OK, part of why this is so effective is actually not just that it induces
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.560]   you to come up with good ideas, but because it is substituting for something that is missing
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.600]   in modern knowledge work, which is workload management.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.480]   In modern knowledge work, and this is an idea I've been writing about, let's say, in the
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.960]   New Yorker in recent years, one of the big issues is that we don't have clear ways to
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.760]   actually manage individual workloads.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.580]   We allow workloads to be distributed in an ad hoc fashion.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.400]   People send you emails, grab you on Slack or in the hallway, hey, what about this?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Can you help me with this?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   Can you join this?
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.420]   It is up to you to figure out how much to bring on your plate.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.480]   It's up to you to figure out when to push back.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.720]   This is a very difficult burden to place onto an individual knowledge worker.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.840]   So what do we tend to do?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.120]   We fall back on what I talk about all the time on the show as the 20% rule.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.240]   We wait until we have about 20% too much work on our plate.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   At that point, we are so stressed out and anxious about our work that our psychological
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.800]   distress gives us emotional cover to say no.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.520]   We're feeling so bad that we finally feel justified to start limiting new stuff on our
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   schedule.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.280]   And what this really looks like in practice is oscillation.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.200]   Things get way out of control.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.800]   From a place of anxiety and burnout, we begin pushing back on new work.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.140]   Eventually we crest the other direction.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.520]   Now we have too little on our plate.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.760]   We've been saying no for a while.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.600]   We finished the things that were stressing us out.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.920]   Now we have too little on our plate.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   So we start saying yes again.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.000]   Then we go right up to the peak again before we fall back down to the valley.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.800]   Fixed schedule productivity, though I did not know it at the time when I introduced
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.080]   it, is a workload management strategy.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:42.160]   By saying my work has to fit into these hours, you have a better metric to use to control
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.400]   your workload than stress and anxiety.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.600]   Your metric is I'm not going to be able to easily fit this within 9-5, so now I have
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   too much on my plate.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.880]   I have to say no or improve how I'm working on what's already there.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.240]   That is a much more reasonable metric than waiting until you're 20% more stressed.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.360]   Trying to fit your work into 9-5, that's actually a reasonable amount of work.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.560]   So what you're implicitly doing with fixed schedule productivity is saying here is a
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.120]   reasonable workload.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.040]   I can do a lot of good work with this workload, but it is sustainable and it can fit into
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.400]   a broader, deeper life that has other concerns than just work.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.640]   And I'm going to work backwards now and make sure what do I need to do to keep my workload
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.880]   to fit within those limits.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.360]   So it's replacing the 20% rule with something much more humane and sustainable.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.440]   I did not have that vocabulary in 2008.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.560]   In part because life as a grad student and a writer is very autonomous, most of the work
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   you do you bring on into your own life, so workload management just wasn't something
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   I was thinking about, I had full control over my workload.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.600]   2023 calcities, that's really one of the key elements for why fixed schedule productivity
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.400]   I think has persevered.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.760]   What about the details?
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:57.400]   What has changed since 2008 in terms of how I actually implement fixed schedule productivity?
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   Because I still do, that's still roughly, I talk about it all the time on the show.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.320]   Work hours, 9-5ish, usually a focus block on Sunday morning.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.760]   So what has changed?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.000]   A lot of the things I talk about in the article I still do, but what else has changed?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.060]   A couple things.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.660]   First of all, as you know, I now have a much more sophisticated, multi-scale planning philosophy
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.040]   to organize my obligations and find time to actually execute them.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.440]   My time management was not so sophisticated as a grad student because it didn't need to
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.880]   be.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.080]   As someone who today has 7 jobs and yet still is trying to satisfy fixed schedule productivity,
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.040]   strategic planning, weekly planning, daily time block planning, all working together
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:45.600]   and coordinating with a good task management capture system is critical.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.760]   I have to have that type of control today in a way that maybe I didn't back then.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:57.200]   So my time management to make my 9-5 goal work is much more complicated.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.980]   Process-centric communication has also become more complicated in my life.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:09.060]   This is what I talk about in a world without email, really thinking through collaboration,
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.940]   really thinking through how are we going to communicate to get something done.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.100]   This wasn't very relevant in 2008 for me.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:25.540]   In 2023, this very much matters, that I cannot just be going back and forth, ad hoc, unscheduled
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.260]   communication in Slack and email for all of my different ongoing projects.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.700]   That would require me to check my inbox all the time.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.420]   The cost of the resulting context shifts would in turn really make it difficult for me to
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.020]   keep my same workload within 9-5.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.860]   So that's another thing I think a lot about today that I did not back then.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:49.540]   How do I communicate and collaborate in a way that minimizes context shifts, that moves
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.420]   away from the hyperactive hive mind and towards something that's much more psychologically
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.080]   and neurologically sustainable.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   So those are the two things that have developed.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.300]   They're much more sophisticated takes on time and attention.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.740]   But that has allowed me to really increase the number of things I am still juggling within
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   that same window of time that I set back when I was, whatever this would have been, 25 or
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   26.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   An interesting aside I want to add here before we wrap this up is I recognized, I was remembering
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.740]   this the other day.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:31.300]   I recognized as I was finishing up grad school that I had things easy from a workload management
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.900]   perspective, that fixed schedule productivity wasn't too hard to implement and that it would
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.980]   get harder.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.820]   And that if I became a professor and I kept writing books, I was looking ahead to my life
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.260]   today and I knew that would be much harder.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.420]   And I actually did during my postdoc years, I spent two years as a postdoc after grad
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:55.180]   school to train for my life right now, to train specifically for satisfying fixed schedule
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.500]   productivity with a busier professional demands.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.460]   I added artificial constraints to my schedule as a postdoc.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.780]   I took two hours out of every day in the middle of the day that I took away from work.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:16.580]   It's where I would, I'd bring my dog to the office and then midday we would go for a run.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.540]   Didn't matter how cold it was, I had all the gear to run in Boston, even when it was really
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   cold.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.820]   We'd go for a run.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.420]   I would do a Navy Seal style calisthenics workout on a floating dock out there in the
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.060]   Charles River off the Esplanade.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.460]   And I would just swipe away, shovel away the snow to make room for sit-ups.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.420]   Then I would go home, bring the dog home.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420]   I would eat lunch.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   I would watch a show.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.420]   I'd take a shower.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:45.140]   I'd go down, maybe get a coffee at the Starbucks on Charles Street and take the T1 stop to
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.140]   the Kendall MIT.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.260]   I'd stay up two hours every day.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   I'd relax.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.060]   I was going to ask you about that actually.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.700]   So you probably remember me talking about that.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700]   Oh, a hundred percent.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.500]   I was going to one of the questions I was going to ask you about because I was like
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.940]   thinking really nine to five, you're going to have like six.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.940]   Well, and that was the point.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.500]   I mean, I did that on purpose because my work was too easy.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.540]   And I said, okay, let me take two hours away because now if I take two hours away to fit
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.780]   my work as a postdoc into nine to five, it's going to be harder and I'll innovate more
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.780]   rules.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.420]   Because when I become a professor, I'm going to have a lot more work to do.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.860]   And so I want to be used to being much more efficient.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.500]   I actually just worried I was out of shape from a productivity standpoint.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   My life was too easy.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.300]   So I took two hours out of every day as a postdoc just to make my life from an organizational
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.880]   perspective harder so that when I became a professor, I would be ready.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   And I think it worked.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.660]   I mean, you know, I was ready for the initial obligations as a professor.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.460]   It was fine.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.240]   Kids were much more, I would say, of a bigger challenge than becoming a professor.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.940]   But this was all training.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.660]   So anyways, I fixed productivity.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.380]   That's sort of the story.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380]   That's where it came from.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380]   That's how I used to think about it.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.820]   This is what I added to it over the years.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.780]   This is where it is in my life right now.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.700]   So my summary here is I think it is very effective.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.080]   If you have a normal knowledge work job, you need some way of managing your workload.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.480]   This is much better than the default of just waiting until you're too stressed out.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.360]   I know it's scary.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   I know you worry.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.280]   Like, what if I say no to people?
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.500]   Yeah, you have to figure out how to do it well.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.780]   It takes experimentation.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.520]   But I do not give up.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.080]   Do not say, look, my work just requires me to work all the time.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.880]   Do the effort required to try to make this work.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.500]   Get organized.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.680]   Get systematic about your collaboration.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Get clear about your workload cues so that you can be much more clear when you say no
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.600]   and say, well, I would love to say yes, but I have too many things on here right now and
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.000]   my cue is full and I keep track of this really carefully.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.080]   Earn people's respect that you're an organized person that does what you say you're going
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.560]   to do when you say you're going to do it.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.920]   So they will grant you the ability to have more flexibility in your workload management
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.720]   because they trust that you know what you're doing.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.480]   They trust that you're on top of things.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.840]   All this is hard work.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.920]   But the single commitment, these are the hours I work and I will do whatever I can to make
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.520]   this happen.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.120]   That will drive all of that effort.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.540]   That will drive all of that improvement.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:16.800]   And if after all of that, your job still makes it impossible, then it's a very good signal
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.520]   to say maybe it's not the right job.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.880]   If your lifestyle vision is not completely centered on your professional aspirations
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.160]   and you can't make fixed schedule productivity work, even when you're on top of all the different
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.600]   things that might work here, then I think that's just a big red flag.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.000]   This life is not compatible with the deep life writ large.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   It's a perfectly useful signal to say maybe I need to make a change.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.040]   So I continue to embrace this and I continue to want to spread the word.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.000]   So I would say my final assessment, I think the article holds up.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.960]   I would write it differently today.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.920]   I would add a much more sophistication to it, but I'm still happy about it.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.880]   So I'll say, Jesse, that we'll keep that in our pantheon of Cal Newport classics, ideas
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.240]   that we keep coming back to.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.920]   I have one follow up question.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.200]   Do you get the, do you ever wish you had more time, like in a given day to work?
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.360]   No, I often wish I had less to do.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.040]   I think that's much more common because I want to fit my time into my work hours.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.920]   I don't like when that's always very crowded.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.600]   I mean, it's okay for me if there are certain points, certain days where my nine to five
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   is very crowded.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.440]   But what I always pine for is having less to do more flexibility in those hours, not
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.220]   more time so I can do more things.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.280]   I still have a fundamental aversion to overload.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.500]   I still have a fundamental aversion to having too much on my plate.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.580]   I don't like it.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:41.840]   My dream remains, you know, the guy who lives on the farm and writes one book a year, six
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.560]   months out of the year and kind of takes a break in between.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.060]   I mean, I don't know if I really have the attention span for that.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.920]   Maybe I'd get antsy, but that still remains in my lifestyle vision.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.380]   I'm based off of that still remains strong.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.720]   I hate having too much to do.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   I don't want more time.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.880]   I want to have too much time for a very small list of obligations.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:07.160]   Yeah, we talked about in episode 256 as well about how that's such a similar theme to your
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.820]   student advice with telling students to, you know, not do all the extracurricular activities
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.800]   and focus on their classes and have time to do that.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.840]   Yeah, it's a weird, there's probably a evolutionary argument to be made here or anthropological
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.280]   argument to be made here about the, I don't know, the physiological rareness of having
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.360]   this sort of overload of different things that need to be done and more things than
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.400]   you can imagine getting done easily in your mind.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   And that's very rare, probably for humans.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   That's an unusual, uncomfortable state for us to be in.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.480]   In knowledge work, we push ourself into that state all the time.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.980]   But I think there's an argument to be made that that's not good.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.140]   In some sense, my new book, Slow Productivity, which is coming out in March, for which by
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.220]   the way, we'll have a cover to release soon, which I'm excited about, is getting at that.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.340]   It's getting at a much more human notion of productivity.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.100]   By human, I mean actually aligned with the way we're wired, a way of doing good work
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:11.460]   that gets us away from this, man, I am just buzzing with activity as I scramble to try
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.980]   to keep on top of everything I need to keep on top of.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.960]   Alright, well we got some questions that are relevant to this.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.260]   Before we get there, I do want to talk about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:32.180]   And that is going to be our friends at Mint Mobile.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.740]   From the gas pump to the grocery store, your utility bills and favorite streaming services,
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.600]   you've been noticing that inflation is everywhere.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.940]   Everything is more expensive than it used to be.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.100]   Thankfully, there's one company out there that's giving you a much needed break, and
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.840]   that is Mint Mobile.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.820]   As the first company to sell premium wireless service online only, Mint Mobile lets you
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:02.300]   order from home and save a ton with phone plans starting at just $15 a month.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.940]   So if you're looking for extra savings this year, Mint Mobile has premium wireless that
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.260]   you can get for just $15 a month.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.260]   I have worked with Mint Mobile.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.740]   I don't have it with me up here in New Hampshire, but at some point I bought a highly rated
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.820]   flip phone or feature phone, a phone that does not have any smartphone features.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.620]   I wanted to have it as an emergency backup phone so I could go places without the distraction
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:33.860]   of my smartphone while preserving the ability to text my wife or call the police.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   So I was figuring out how I was going to do this.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.540]   Am I going to add this to my AT&T plan?
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.740]   How am I going to make this happen?
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.980]   Mint Mobile is how I did this.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.660]   Oh, for $15 a month I can get a SIM card sent to me for a basic premium wireless service,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.580]   stick it in the back of the phone that I just bought on Amazon.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.700]   The phone was like $70 or something.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.700]   Now I have a fully functional phone and it has barely cost me that much money.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.420]   So that's how I've used it.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.260]   Other people have used it in a lot of other ways.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.660]   But the key thing about Mint Mobile is the savings come from the fact that they are online
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.220]   only.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.900]   They get rid of all of the overhead associated with retail, with all the TV advertising,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.020]   those stores you go into when there's no one there to ever help you and you end up leaving
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.020]   in frustration.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.740]   By getting rid of all that, they can offer you service cheaper.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.420]   You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.300]   You can keep your same phone number along with all your existing contacts, switch to
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.020]   Mint Mobile and get premium wireless service starting at just $15 a month.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.220]   So to get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month and to get that plan shipped to
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:39.260]   your door for free, go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.020]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:49.140]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.700]   Also want to talk about our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.660]   As I always say, ideas are power and the best source of ideas is books.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.700]   The problem is figuring out which books you should actually bother buying and trying to
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.740]   read.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.620]   This is where Blinkist enters the scene.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:11.220]   It is a subscription service that gives you short summaries of thousands of best-selling
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.900]   non-fiction books.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.140]   These short summaries called Blinks you can either read or listen to using the Blinkist
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.140]   app.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.860]   It takes about 15 minutes to read or listen to and you get all the big ideas of all of
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.920]   the big new non-fiction books.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:33.240]   The way that Jesse and I use Blinkist is as a triage service for our lives as readers.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.820]   If we're interested in a particular book we've heard about, we download.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.180]   I usually read the Blinks.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.140]   Jesse likes to listen to them or maybe I have that backwards.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.320]   Maybe Jesse reads them.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   I usually read them.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   I sometimes listen to them.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.580]   I read them more than I read them.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.580]   You read them.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.580]   I read them more.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.580]   That's right.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.580]   You read them.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.580]   I sometimes listen to them.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.580]   I sometimes read them.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.580]   I sometimes listen as well.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.700]   But anyways, the point is, what we do is in that 15 minutes you get the main ideas of
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.540]   the book almost always tells you, "Oh yes, I want to buy this."
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.780]   Or "Oh no, that'd be a waste.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.380]   It's not what I thought it was."
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.980]   Or it is what I thought it was, but honestly this 15 minutes tells me I know all I need
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.580]   to know about this book.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:17.060]   So it is a great accompaniment to the reading life and reading, of course, is so critical
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.980]   to the deep life.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.860]   A couple other things to point out about it.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.380]   They have these collections online, which I appreciate.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.020]   Well-known writers, including writers who are friends of the show, like Adam Grant or
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.180]   Dan Pink, will have collections where they curate a collection of books they like.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.380]   And then you can just go listen to the Blinks and figure out which of those you want to
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.380]   actually purchase.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.860]   They also have a, for a limited time, a service called Blinkist Connect, a feature called
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   Blinkist Connect, that allows you to share your premium account with a friend.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.980]   So you get two accounts for the price of one.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.580]   So listen, if you read, you need Blinkist.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.980]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:03.180]   Go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your 7-day free trial and get 25% off a Blinkist Premium
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.180]   Membership.

[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   Blinkist.com/deep.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.100]   And remember, now for a limited time, you can even use Blinkist Connect to share your
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.380]   premium account.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.420]   You will get two premium subscriptions for the price of one.
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.140]   All right, let us, let's move on some questions, Jesse.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.060]   What do we got here today?
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.340]   Sounds good.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.540]   First question is from Alex.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.860]   Limiting your workload to a fixed amount of time each day makes sense to me.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.300]   But how do you decide what kinds of activities fall within your fixed schedule?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.100]   For example, does reading have to happen inside your fixed schedule deadline?
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.300]   That is a good question, Alex.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.220]   You know, what needs to be within the nine to five if you're an FSP or Fixed Schedule
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.940]   Productivity Aficionado?
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.940]   What doesn't?
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.300]   A couple points I want to make here.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.180]   Personal and leisure activities, community activities, family activities.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.660]   So basically anything that's non-professional does not have to, of course, fall within your
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660]   fixed schedule.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.020]   However, it can.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.760]   So I think this is an important point I want to make.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.860]   You can put non-work activities during your fixed schedule.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.060]   In fact, that's often a kind of a nice way to do it.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.980]   I go out to the gym during my lunch hour.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.700]   It might actually be the right way to do that, especially if you have kids coming home after
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.700]   work.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.620]   So non-professional activities do not have to be within the fixed schedule, but they
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.020]   can be in there.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.540]   All right, so they can be in there if you want them to be.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.720]   It's OK to also have some exceptions to the fixed schedule.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.780]   So I want to be clear about this.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.180]   I call them autopilot exceptions.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.740]   A small number of things that happen outside your fixed schedule that are professional,
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.220]   but they happen at the same times, on the same days, in the same place, in a heavily
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.660]   ritualized fashion, right?
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.780]   So it's not haphazard.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.300]   It's not, I just need to spend more time on email.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.740]   I'm working and I didn't get as much done today as I wanted to, so I'm just going to
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.980]   work some more after my fixed schedule is over.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.040]   It is not that.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.760]   It is autopiloted exceptions to same work, same place, same time, same ritual every week.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:21.020]   So for example, for a long time, I would write my weekly blog post in the evening.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.700]   And I had a ritual around where I would do it and I would write it in the big leather
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.820]   chair, which old time Cal Newport fans know about.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.380]   And I put on a record on the record player.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.980]   There's a whole particular ritual.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.460]   I also have this Sunday morning writing ritual.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.520]   Now I was actually surprised to see in my 2008 post, I just said Sunday morning is part
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   of the fixed schedule.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.140]   But I often think about that as just an exception, but I only do writing during that time.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:50.300]   And so the key for these autopiloted exceptions to your fixed schedule is that it has to be
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   a specific work.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.460]   It has to be a focused work and it cannot be general purpose.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.580]   You cannot just say, yeah, on Sunday morning, I just do more email and just generic work.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.340]   On a weekday night, I just do email and generic work.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.000]   That's going to throw you out of your leisure mode.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.380]   It's going to ruin your shutdown.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.300]   It's going to open up a lot of loops and then it's going to be pretty dangerous.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.700]   So you can have these exceptions that happen at the same time on the same days, but it
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.100]   should be for the same work and that work should be focused and it should not be general
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.100]   purpose.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:23.420]   It should not induce generic, highly varied context shifts as well.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.940]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.060]   Next question is from Catherine.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.300]   How do you keep your work hours reasonable when people are constantly asking to do things
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.020]   and it's hard to say no without creating negative impacts on your career?
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.460]   This is often the big issue I hear, the most common issue I hear about fixed schedule productivity
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.860]   is I'm going to have to say no to things.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:56.820]   The amount of things coming onto my plate is so furious that to fit nine to five, I'm
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.740]   going to have to say no to more things than I currently do today.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.740]   Now, I have a couple of points I want to make about this because I think no as a skill is
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.780]   something we don't discuss with enough nuance.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.900]   First I want to make the point, it was just Catherine, right?
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.540]   Yeah, so Catherine, first I want to make the point, you're already saying no.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.620]   You're already saying no.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:23.100]   It is highly unlikely that if you're like the standard knowledge worker who is roughly
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.260]   nine to five or nine to six, but kind of does second shifts a lot of night as well for an
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.200]   hour or two extra to try to keep up with things.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.340]   So maybe you're working, you have sort of 55 hours a week, 55 to 60 hours a week that
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   you're actually working.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.900]   It's highly unlikely that the incoming volume of work towards you, all the requests and
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.040]   emails and Slack and meetings, exactly requires 55 to 60 hours a week.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   Highly unlikely.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.220]   What's really happening is, again, you're following the 20% rule.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   Once you get the intuition that your workload is no longer going to fit into this like 55
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.520]   to 60 hours stretch week, you are saying no.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.400]   Whether it's explicit or not, you're pulling back from things, you're pushing things off
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   your plate.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   You're already saying no.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.040]   It's just you've fixed where you're saying no at a place that I guess generates enough
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.120]   psychic pain that it feels like you're justifying it.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.760]   So all we're talking about is fixed productivity.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   You're still saying no.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.160]   You're just saying it a little bit earlier in your workload.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.520]   So really this is the fundamental psychological Rubicon people have to pass.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.480]   What is the reasonable amount of work to have on my plate before I say no?
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.220]   Most knowledge workers set that to be too big.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.340]   60 hours, right?
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:39.180]   Which again is 50 to 60 hours, about 20 to 30% more than a 40-hour workweek.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.820]   It's too much for most people.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.580]   But for most people, they feel like it's hard enough that they're justified still saying
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.580]   no.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:50.220]   You pull that back to something like 40 hours, it becomes much more sustainable for you.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.080]   From the perspective of the outside world, the difference is small.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.180]   You're doing a lot of work, you're saying no to a lot of work.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.180]   They don't know the difference.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.740]   They don't know if it's 40 hours or if it's 60 hours.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   That difference can be small.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.140]   So that's the first point I want to make, Catherine.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.140]   You're already saying no.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.220]   We're just talking about exactly where that boundary, that phase transition from acceptance
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.420]   to rejection happens in your career.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.180]   The second thing I'm going to say, and let's get tactical here, is how do you say no?
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.340]   This really matters.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:23.940]   So people often struggle with what I call the naked no, where technically you do have
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.980]   more time and you're just saying, "No, I don't want to do that."
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.820]   Silence.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.820]   That is very difficult.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.980]   People have a hard time with that.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:38.340]   That can be interpreted as aggressive or it can be interpreted as you are non-cooperative
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.620]   or not a team player.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.420]   It is very difficult to give the naked no.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.780]   So what's much more effective is to have workload systems that help dictate when you say no
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:57.060]   so that you can fall back on the logic of those systems to help justify your answers.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.700]   So one thing you could do, I'm going to give you two ideas here.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.900]   One thing you could do is quotas.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.140]   This is something I talked about briefly in my 2008 article.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.500]   It's a common strategy among professors.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:12.100]   For certain types of work that you know you're going to have a lot of incoming, you set your
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:17.100]   quotas per whatever, quarter, per month, per year, whatever the scale that makes sense
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.780]   to say, "This is how much I do during each time period.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.140]   This is a reasonable amount.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.740]   It allows me to be very useful to other people in my community, but prevents this from getting
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.140]   out of control."
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.300]   When you have filled your quota for that time period, you then say no to new work and you
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.520]   justify it by saying, "I have a quota where I do this many types of projects, this many
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.140]   journal reviews, travel to this many conferences, do this many client meetings per week.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.660]   I have this quota about what's optimal.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.580]   I do three of those, four of those, 20 of those.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.940]   I've already filled it for this time period, so I'm going to have to say no now, but keep
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.700]   me in mind for future time periods because I do a lot of this."
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.420]   Quotas work well because they're hard to say push back against.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.620]   If I push back against you having a quota, what I'm pushing back against is your quota
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.260]   size and that makes me feel like a jerk.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.640]   If you say, "I can't do this review.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.720]   Look, I have a quota of five per semester, sort of the right balance, and I already have
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.160]   five on my plate."
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.800]   I'm not going to say, "No, six is the right answer.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   You're dumb.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   It should be six.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   Take this on."
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.720]   Because that's weird and specific and sort of aggressive.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.820]   So quotas, they're very useful because it has a very specific workload management system
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.080]   that you can cite, hard to argue with.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:34.480]   The other thing you can try is pre-planning non-trivial work on your calendar.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.040]   This is again, something I get into more detail in my new book coming out in March, Slow Productivity.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.400]   I get into this idea, I've been thinking more about it.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.320]   But when a project comes in, you say, "I'm actually going to find time on my calendar
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.400]   for when I'm going to do this project.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.760]   Maybe it's five different long sessions I'm going to have to find."
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:55.800]   And you go and you have to find it and block off that time before you accept it.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.340]   The reason why this is a really useful strategy is that it actually gives you a concrete understanding
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.720]   of how much available time you have outside of just the immediate future.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:11.440]   So if you struggle to find time, "OK, I need five two-hour sessions to write this report.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:18.260]   I can't find five two-hour sessions I can fit on the schedule for another three months."
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.640]   That is really useful feedback.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.600]   That then allows you to say to the person, "Basically, I'm looking for this time.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.240]   I track my time very carefully.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.480]   I don't really have time.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.180]   I'm assuming this would be about 10 hours.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.960]   I can't see myself really doing that until March."
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.520]   And they might say, "OK, whatever, that's too late.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   I'll ask someone else to do it."
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.040]   Or they'll say, "Yeah, great, do it then."
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.920]   But what you're getting here is a concrete feedback signal about how much time you actually
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   have.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.680]   This is much better than just saying in the moment, "Could I imagine myself in the abstract
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   writing this report?
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.680]   Yeah, I've written these before.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.920]   I don't want to disappoint this guy.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   Yeah, I'll do it."
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   And then you don't really have time, so now it's going to have to happen at night.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.400]   Now it's going to have to happen early in the morning or on the weekends.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.540]   By actually planning non-trivial work on your calendar, it's a pain, but it gives you a
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:06.140]   really concrete feedback signal about how much time you actually have available.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:12.080]   Then you can make much more reasonable decisions about what you say yes or no to, citing this
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.100]   careful tracking when you say no.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.140]   So again, what's the pushback here?
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.140]   You did it wrong.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.140]   You do have time.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.140]   You're dumb.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.140]   They're not going to say that.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.220]   Or they'll say, "You should just make more time available.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.020]   You should work late at night or in the morning."
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.960]   People want you to do that, but they're not going to specifically ask you to do that in
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   most jobs.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.000]   So again, that becomes really effective.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.560]   Now one of the ideas I elaborate in slow productivity is this is a pain.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.960]   To try to schedule everything on your calendar is a pain, especially because things take
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.200]   longer than you think.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.040]   It's like time block planning on a massive scale.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.080]   It's not something you want to do all the time, but what I do suggest is if you do this
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.640]   for a few months, for example, you learn.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.220]   You learn and internalize a much more accurate understanding of how long things take and
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.160]   how full your schedule really is.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.360]   And then you can go forward after two or three months of this exercise, stop doing that detailed
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:07.600]   planning, but still possess that much more finely honed intuition about your workload
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.700]   capacities.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:16.000]   And so you're able to then just more intuitively say yes or no, because you've taught yourself
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.320]   the reality of your schedule.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   All right.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.480]   So anyways, I like this.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.940]   To make any of this work, to move past the naked no, to instead reference particular
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.840]   workload management systems as the logic for you saying no, you have to have a reputation
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.780]   as an organized, reliable person.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.160]   You have to have a reputation as someone who's very careful about keeping track of their
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.920]   time that talks about Cal Newport to an uncomfortable degree.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.640]   People are kind of tired of hearing about it.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.340]   That has a time block planner on your desk and spends way too much time with Trello.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:55.080]   You have pinup posters of the Atlantean who owns Trello's CEO on your wall.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.480]   You got to be that person.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.700]   You got to be that person.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.720]   And if you are that person, they're like, okay, they probably know what they're talking
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   about.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   They're really organized.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   They get things done.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.720]   They deliver when they say.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   So if they say, I'm very careful with my workload.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   I can't fit this till March.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.560]   I don't think this is appropriate for me.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.800]   You get the benefit of the doubt.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.200]   If you're unreliable, if you let things drop, you're like, you're probably just making excuses.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   I don't like this.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   This is the first thing I'm telling you to do.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   Do it right away.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   I don't trust you.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.480]   So you got to be reliable.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.120]   You got to be organized to get away with this stuff.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.560]   But replacing the naked no with references to workload management logics, this I think
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.800]   Catherine is a good way to go.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.280]   I've met that CEO actually, Jesse.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   He's Australian.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.880]   You've mentioned that on the podcast a few times.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.080]   Australian accents makes everyone seem more interesting.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.840]   So what I'm trying to say here, Jesse, is can you do the rest of the show with an Australian
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   accent?
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.840]   I may.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.000]   So what you're saying is yes.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.800]   As long as every question comes back to you saying, I may, that will be okay.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.240]   I'm just saying if we had accents, I think people would, if you had an Australian accent
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.640]   and I had a really good Oxford refined English accent, I think we would get.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.320]   Well, you have the good pipe smoking French accent that we use.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.800]   That accent is perfectly accurate.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.600]   Exactly as the Frenchman speak.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.740]   Unfortunately, that's not what people want to hear to think that you're very, very smart.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.720]   They want to hear a really refined English accent.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   So then they'll think I'm very smart.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.040]   And if you do an Australian accent, they'll think you're exciting and fun.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.640]   So I think that's our key.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   Much more accents.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   All right.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   In the meantime, though, let's move on.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   Next question.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   All right.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.960]   Next question is from Andy.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.680]   Why don't you put your weekly plan in your calendar?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.820]   In my workplace, we use Outlook calendars heavily.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.760]   So if I plan to use two hours on Thursday to write a memo, I need to block that time
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.000]   anyway.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.720]   And a calendar is very visual way of planning your week.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.960]   So why don't you write your plan out instead of blocking it on your calendar?
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.560]   So why do you write your plan out instead of blocking it on your calendar?
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:12.440]   Well, my calendar does get heavy use as I go through my weekly planning discipline.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.260]   So I will lay this as the foundation for my answer.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:21.060]   Weekly planning itself is, think about it as the discipline of reviewing everything
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:25.160]   that's on your plate, reviewing your quarterly or strategic plans.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.340]   What am I working on?
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:30.780]   Reviewing your calendar, reviewing your task systems, and trying to pull that all together
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:35.600]   to figure out a reasonable plan for what you want to do for the week ahead.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.800]   That's the core of weekly planning.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.440]   What you then do with that information can vary.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.940]   It can vary between individuals.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.520]   It can vary within different periods for the same individual.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.740]   So that's what I want to talk about is my own weekly planning approach.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:59.520]   There are periods of my year in which I will translate a lot of the results of my weekly
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.000]   planning session to calendar events.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.760]   This is particularly the case in busy periods, academic busy periods.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.860]   I'm teaching, I'm on some committees, there's some deadline coming up, and there's a lot
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.360]   of moving pieces that I have to find time for.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.440]   In those periods, I will often put quite a lot of things that I identify I need to do
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.640]   during my weekly planning session onto my calendar.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.000]   There are other periods, however, let's say during the summer, a typical summer when I'm
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.200]   not teaching or anything, where my schedule is much more deep work focused.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.840]   And in those situations, I'm not going to load up everything I'm going to work on, all
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.320]   the thinking or writing I'm going to do.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.040]   I'm not going to put that on my calendar.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.800]   I'm going to leave my calendar to just have appointments and meetings.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.200]   I got to call this person, I have to go to this doctor's appointment.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.400]   And the rest, I'm going to just time block each day based off of a fully written weekly
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   plan.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.000]   "Hey, this week I'm working on this book chapter."
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Work on it most days.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.120]   This is a very common weekly plan for me, by the way, in the summer.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.640]   Work on this book chapter every day.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:09.320]   Try to get a good 30 minute admin block in there somewhere just to keep track of small
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   things.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   Here's a couple admin things to make sure you get done.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.880]   That's a very typical weekly plan for me in July.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.600]   And then when I time block plan, I look at that, I look at my calendar, my calendar might
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.400]   have one meeting I have to do that day, and I time block out a plan based off of that.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.940]   If you look at my weekly plan in October, it might be very different.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.940]   It might actually be most of the stuff I need to get done, it's so complicated how it's
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:31.940]   all going to fit together.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:37.600]   I've worked it all out on my calendar, just like Andy actually does during his work.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.440]   So you'll see it both ways.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.600]   The other thing I want to point out, however, is that a weekly plan can contain information
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.680]   beyond simply what you're going to work on and when you are going to work on it.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:53.040]   I have a list here of other things that will sometimes make it onto my written weekly plan.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.160]   Things about disciplines or behaviors will go on there.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.680]   Remember we're doing this thing with our diet this week.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.280]   Remember we're trying to do a really clean shutout every day.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.560]   Because you look at your weekly plan every morning, it's useful for more than simply
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   pointing out or allocating time for what you want to get done.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.520]   Sometimes I have more elaborated descriptions of work.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:22.640]   Even if that work has an appointment on my calendar, I might have a more detailed description
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.360]   of what that means in my weekly plan.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.400]   So the calendar might just say, "Mega Conference Task Block."
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.240]   And then my weekly plan is where I unfold what that means in a way that wouldn't fit
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.880]   just into my calendar description.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.320]   Okay, well I've got to get on top of all the planning for this conference that I'm organizing.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.280]   And so what I really want to get done in these three hours are these things.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.000]   And so the weekly plan might contain an elaboration for an event that does also show up on your
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.640]   calendar.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   Heuristics show up.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.800]   So a lot of times weekly plans are good for heuristics.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.240]   Every day at lunch, go for a 20-minute walk.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.480]   I don't necessarily want to write that on my calendar every day.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.440]   I might just say, "Do a 20-minute walk."
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.320]   Or in my summer, where I say, "Do 30 minutes of tasks.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.400]   Look in your inbox.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.040]   Do three or four things on your task list.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   Just do this every weekday."
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.240]   That's a really useful heuristic.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.920]   I look at that every day.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.760]   When I time block plan, I'll add a block for it.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.240]   I might not want to actually figure out all those times in advance.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.080]   Because maybe I don't know how long my deep work is going to take that day.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.760]   I just want to make sure I remember to do it every day.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.120]   And also highlighting tasks for admin blocks.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.320]   This is really common.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.880]   So in a busy period, I might actually block out time for admin.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:33.320]   Email, tasks, making sure that I preserve that time every day so I don't start drowning
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:39.080]   or don't start having to break my fixed schedule and try to do small things at the night, late
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   at night or in the morning.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   What I'll often do is maybe even have admin on my calendar.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.280]   But in my weekly plan, say, "Look, here's six things I saw when I was looking through
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   my task list.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.000]   They really have to get done this week."
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.560]   So really prioritize these whenever you get to an admin block in your daily plan.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.920]   Make sure we're taking a few things from this list.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:03.520]   So a weekly plan really can capture a lot of information beyond just the raw things
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.640]   you're going to work on and what times you're going to work on it.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   So there you go.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.600]   If you have a really busy schedule, if you want to work out a lot of pieces on your calendar,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   go for it.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.740]   If you don't have a busy schedule and you want to leave your calendar just for appointments
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.140]   or meetings, go for that as well.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.320]   If you want to do something in between, go for that as well.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.160]   The key is to sit down each week and confront what you have to do and make sure you have
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.720]   captured somewhere some sort of plan you can reference every day.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.240]   There's got to be some written component to that.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.200]   Even if most of it's on your calendar, there's going to be some written component.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.800]   Sometimes that'll be larger than others.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:41.480]   I will say in the new time block planner that's coming out in August, and I'm getting my advanced
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:47.000]   copy soon, I have a blank version of the calendar from the planner where you have to exactly
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.680]   approve all of the materials and exactly the spiral.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.000]   And so I know exactly what it's going to look like, but a full featured version of my new
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.040]   time block planners is coming to me up here in New Hampshire soon.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.000]   I'm excited for that.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.680]   I've actually condensed the weekly planning pages in the new time block planner.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.960]   There's a two page spread.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.000]   One page is notes for the weekend.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.280]   The other page is one page for written notes on the weekly plan for the week ahead.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.440]   So I've actually reduced the space, recognizing in part, a lot of stuff will go on your calendar,
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.280]   but there is a place there in the planner that have some notes for your week every time.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:26.160]   So anyway, weekly planning is a, man, what an art.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.720]   It's so many different ways to do this.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.640]   So I always appreciate a chance to actually talk about it.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.040]   Jesse, I'm excited for that planner, by the way.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.320]   I actually have a list of disciplines.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.200]   I'm temporarily not tracking my daily disciplines because I'm waiting for the new planner to
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   arrive.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.040]   But I think I get it next week and it has great metric tracking places.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   So I'll show it on the show once I get it.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.080]   The release date is still August 15th, though, you should consider pre-ordering.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:00.920]   Again, they told me you should consider pre-ordering because if we sell out, it might take a minute
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.720]   to replace because of some supply chain issues.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.440]   These printer supply chains are, they're their own thing.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.560]   So if you're worried about it, you could consider pre-ordering.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:16.600]   But we'll talk more about that as we get closer to that coming out.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.520]   Even though you're not tracking your daily metrics, are you still doing them?
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.480]   No, I haven't written down what they're supposed to be.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.040]   So I see them every day, but it's not quite the same, you know, if I can't write it down.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.080]   So I need that planner to get here sooner rather than later.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.880]   All right, let's see.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   Let's do one more question.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.600]   I have a short case study I want to do in a second.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.760]   So let's do one more question and then I'll do my short case study.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.760]   Sounds good.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.800]   Next question is from Benjamin.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.160]   What immediate actions would you suggest to do when too much work has been piling up?
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.160]   All right, that's a good question.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:58.520]   So you you're at the peak of, you know, you pile up too much work, and now you need to
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.080]   pull back.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.000]   Short term, quit, back out, upset people.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.160]   If you're overloaded, and it's impossible to get this work done, even with using the
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.840]   time that's available, you have to actually feel the pain of needing to say, I'm sorry,
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.040]   I need to back out of this.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.680]   I know I said I could help with this, but I have too much on my plate.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.720]   That's better than just doing all these things bad.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.240]   I think people are more upset that you were on the team and didn't do anything.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.880]   They are that you said, look, when I do something, I want to do it well.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   I miscalibrated my schedule.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.960]   I have too much on my plate.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.200]   Once you gain back that breathing room, then I think your focus has to be how do I prevent
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.020]   this from happening again?
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.000]   We do not want the oscillations.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.040]   There's only so many times you can go to this, I'm in over my head, I need to pull back well
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.840]   before people think of the boy who cried productivity wolf.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.640]   So you're gonna have to do some drastic stuff now if you're completely drowning.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:02.200]   But that has to motivate you to put the systems in place to prevent that from happening again.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.240]   And this is where everything we've talked about on the show and in the deep dive today,
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   the fixed schedule productivity, and all of these small habits of innovation this induces,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.520]   this would be the time to do it.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   You pull back, you make your new commitment to a reasonable workload, and you begin using
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.620]   all the different things we talked about to manage your workload, to get away from the
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.240]   naked nose, to be much more organized with your time and your weekly plan.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   All of that, this has to be your motivation to get all of that up and running properly
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.040]   so that you do not end up in this place again and again.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:40.200]   All right, so I have a short but relevant case study to share here about someone who
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:47.800]   has succeeded with getting these FSP inspired strategies and systems in place.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.760]   All right, so here I'm reading this now, this was sent to us.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.080]   I am head of a large humanities department and it is busy.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.100]   Reading your book, a world without email, and listening to your podcast has revolutionized
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.920]   my performance.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.520]   My calendar is half filled with autopilot appointments and I have office hours every
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   day after lunch.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.720]   With this, my performance is much better.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:14.440]   I feel less stressed and I leave my office at 4pm most every day.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:21.200]   All of the academics in the audience are very impressed by this idea of a department chair
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.560]   leaving the office at 4pm every day.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:28.640]   I think this helps emphasize the power of fixed schedule productivity.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.280]   Because he has this, I want to leave work at a reasonable hour, and he's working backwards
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:39.000]   from that and willing to be innovative and aggressive in how he builds his work around
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.120]   that goal, he was able to accomplish something pretty cool.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.400]   So let me just pull out the two things he mentioned in particular.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.160]   One is autopilot appointments.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.640]   So what that means is work he knows he has to do on a regular basis.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.280]   So as a department chair, things he has to do every week or every month or every semester,
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.880]   he finds the time to do them.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.320]   Gets it on his calendar.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.680]   That time, that days, every week, every month, every semester, so he doesn't have to think
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   about it.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.360]   So he's protecting the time for the things he knows he has to do in advance.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.640]   And that really makes a difference.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:18.880]   It means that work will get done within his work hours, and it will be properly taken
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.740]   into account when he's trying to schedule other optional things.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:27.820]   If Friday, his time has been put aside for whatever he has to do for the budgeting process,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:32.240]   when he sees that, he won't schedule too long meetings for that day.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.880]   Because that time has already been put aside.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.940]   He'll defer those meetings or push them to a later date or take them off of his plate.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:43.820]   So autopilot appointments not only relieves you from having to think on the fly, what
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.420]   do I want to work on today?
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:49.660]   It also makes sure that you properly respect and account for the time that this work is
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.260]   going to take.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.580]   So in advance, it gets protected and you don't overfill those days.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:56.820]   The other thing mentioned here is everyday office hours.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.380]   Oh, how critical that is for a managerial position like department chair.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:04.620]   That means every day there is a set time where you could call him, come to his office, or
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.140]   I assume load on Zoom or Slack or whatever tools they use.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.980]   And you know he'll be there for synchronous interaction.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:18.900]   I can tell you as a chair, he could probably defer 90% of the emails that are coming in
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.880]   from the administration and his faculty to those office hours.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.900]   We're talking dozens and dozens of emails each week that would normally require an ad
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:32.380]   hoc back and forth conversation, seven messages over two days, each of which that requires
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:39.220]   ten inbox checks, so 70 inbox checks per interaction, multiplied by ten interactions, that's 700
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:44.380]   inbox checks, you know, huge amounts of context switching and pain that all can get erased
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.340]   with daily office hours.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.500]   All those interactions, they can say, great, just grab me at my office hours, call me,
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.980]   jump on Zoom, we'll talk about it.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.620]   And in two minutes back and forth, we figure out a plan, no ad hoc messaging required.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:02.620]   So those two simple strategies, scheduling in advance all regular work, and then deferring
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:07.300]   as much interaction as possible to in-person office hours, those two strategies gave us
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   a chair of a humanities department, a large humanities department working only until four.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.100]   I think that just emphasizes the potential of fixed yield of productivity.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:20.220]   When you fix a limit and are serious about it, you can get seriously inventive about
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:26.580]   how you satisfy it, and much more sustainable work can come out of it.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:27.580]   So I appreciate that.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.060]   I appreciate that case study.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:35.500]   That's one of my goals, Jesse, is I want, at some point, office hours to be just a common
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.260]   thing in most companies.
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.980]   Come to my office hours, ask me then, we'll talk about it then, or I'll come to your next
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   office hours.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:50.180]   I just don't think people realize how much pain that's actually alleviating.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.540]   And even today, when a lot of work has gone remote, it's pretty easy to do just on Zoom
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.540]   or whatever.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.460]   Yeah, you just have Zoom with waiting rooms.
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:00.700]   Professors figured this out two days into the pandemic.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.180]   You have a Zoom room open, because we did all of our actual academic office hours on
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.540]   Zoom during the early pandemic.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.780]   You create a Zoom room that has a waiting room.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.820]   And so people can just stop by whenever they log in, and they sit in the waiting room until
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.900]   you're ready to talk to them, and you click the button, you bring them in.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.460]   So you're not overhearing conversations people are having with other people.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.460]   It works fine.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.460]   It works fine.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.460]   All right.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.460]   I want to get to the books.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.460]   I want to get to the June books.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:29.180]   First, let's just talk about another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.820]   And that is our friends at Ladder.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:38.060]   Look, you need life insurance if there's anyone who depends on you.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:43.500]   If you're like I've been in prior parts of my life, you might be putting off that very
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:48.540]   basic task because you don't know how to do it.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.040]   I need life insurance.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.420]   This is this big amorphous thing.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.980]   How do I actually make that happen?
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   Do I go to an office?
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.260]   Are they going to take my blood?
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.700]   Do I have to go to a doctor?
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   This seems impossible.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.260]   I'm just going to procrastinate on it.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.940]   This is where Ladder enters the scene.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:08.940]   It gets rid of all of your sources of procrastination when it comes to this very vital protection,

[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   All of Ladder's policies are insured by insurers with long proven histories of paying claims.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.340]   Insurers that are rated A or A+ by A and Best.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:49.780]   Look, life insurance costs more the older you get.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.460]   So when's the right time to get life insurance?
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.360]   As soon as possible.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.540]   Ladder will make that easy.
[00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:00.780]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you are instantly approved.

[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:13.980]   Now as long as we're talking about protection, let's talk about digital protection and how
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:21.180]   our friends at ExpressVPN can help you maintain your digital privacy.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.700]   So here's the thing.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:28.200]   When you are using the internet, there are people who are watching what sites and services
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.460]   you use.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.740]   They are harvesting that information.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:37.020]   They are selling that information to advertisers or other people who want to know more about
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020]   you.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:43.540]   So if you're logged into a wireless access point, for example, at a Starbucks, anyone
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.940]   can see the packets you're sending through the air.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:51.300]   And even if the contents of your packets are protected, they can see what website you're
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   talking to.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:58.260]   What about if you're at home, plugged into the wall, your private internet cable service
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.220]   you get to the cable company?
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:05.180]   The cable company can look at who are you talking to, gather that information, sell
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.580]   it to people who want to know more about you.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.180]   And they do do this as well.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.780]   So how do you avoid people watching what you're doing on the internet?
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.140]   This is where a VPN enters the scene.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:17.180]   What you do is instead of directly connecting to a site or service, you connect instead
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.140]   to a VPN server.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.020]   You then send the VPN server an encrypted note that says, "Here's who I really want
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.020]   to talk to."
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.100]   The server talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the answer, and sends
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   it back to you.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.060]   So what does your cable company or the guy next to the Starbucks Wi-Fi access point learn
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.420]   about you?
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.660]   Nothing.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.820]   Only that you're talking to a VPN server.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.100]   So they can gain no useful information about your actual internet activity.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100]   So VPNs are great.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.500]   The key is you need one that is easy to use and has fast connection speeds.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.000]   That's ExpressVPN.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.540]   That's why I use ExpressVPN.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.980]   Their software is fantastic.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.320]   You turn it on with a click of a button, you use your web browsers or apps as normal.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.620]   You don't even realize this complicated dance with the VPN service is happening in the background,
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.700]   but you get all of those benefits.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.820]   ExpressVPN has VPN servers all around the country and the world.
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.500]   So wherever you are, there's probably a nearby server to connect to, which is important because
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.580]   nearby means fast, they also have great amounts of bandwidth.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.100]   So you don't even notice any slowdown.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   So to use the internet in the modern age, you need a VPN.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.940]   If you're going to use a VPN, I suggest ExpressVPN.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.100]   So if you don't like big tech tracking you and selling your data for profit, it's time
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.700]   to fight back.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:36.140]   Visit ExpressVPN.com/deep right now to protect your online freedom and privacy.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.860]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.940]   Don't forget the slash deep so they know you came from me.
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.940]   All right.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:54.700]   So Jesse, like I like to do, let's talk about the books I read during the previous month.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.860]   So we're in July now.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.660]   So we should talk about June, 2023.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:06.360]   Let me go through the five books I read in June, 2023.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.160]   The first was The Wager by David Gran.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.500]   I think this might have been mandated by law that everyone had to read this book.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.140]   I think I maybe had a legal obligation to read this book.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.700]   Certainly everyone has seemed to have read this book.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700]   It's great.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:25.420]   I love David Gran, epic famous New Yorker writer who does these really long, deeply
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.800]   researched type adventure books.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.460]   His book, The Killers of the Flower Moon, is being made into a movie, was made into
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.460]   a movie.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.940]   It was written with Leonardo DiCaprio, directed by Scorsese.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.140]   Scorsese and DiCaprio already bought the rights to The Wager.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:46.280]   The Wager is about a shipwreck back in the 18th century off the west coast of Patagonia.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.520]   Not a great place to have a shipwreck in the 18th century.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.380]   And he recreates that story in vivid detail.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.580]   Interesting tidbit about The Wager.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.260]   I mean, Gran's a great writer.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:02.300]   His MO with a lot of these books was he puts himself into the narrative.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.980]   So if you read, for example, The Lost City of Z, you'll see he puts himself into the
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.980]   narrative.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.940]   Well, he did the research to do that for this book.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.620]   He went to this island, Wager Island, off the desolate coast of Patagonia, but he didn't
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.940]   like the way that the writing was working.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.340]   And so he cut himself out in the book.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.840]   So he's actually not in this book, even though that was the original plan.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:26.900]   He spent the whole year just learning enough nautical terminology to understand the record
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.340]   so he could start doing research for this book.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.780]   This is a classic, classic deep research.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.500]   But Gran writes with a narrative momentum and a sense of adventure that's fantastic.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   It's a great book.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:45.100]   It's selling, and I looked this up here on Bookscan, all of the copies.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.540]   So good for David Gran.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.540]   Do you know him?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.540]   I've never met him.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.540]   Never met him.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]   Epic.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.020]   Do you associate with a lot of the other writers at The New Yorker?
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.340]   Do you ever talk to them?
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.340]   I know some of them.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.460]   I mean, it's not just New Yorker.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:04.260]   I mean, I just know, I'm more likely to associate with writers, magazine writers, nonfiction
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.860]   writers, who are local.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.660]   So like who also live in DC, more so than sorting them out by like we happen to write
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.940]   for the same magazine.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.060]   So like DC has a bunch of Atlantic writers, for example, because the Atlantic is headquartered
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   there.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   There are some New Yorker writers in DC.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   Evan Osnos is in DC.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:24.460]   There's a few others.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.020]   So I should have spent time.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020]   David Gran though is a cool...
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:33.340]   He's kind of a famous figure because he writes, he'll write these epic stories.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   There's another one.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:40.020]   It's a New Yorker piece sort of famous for where he's hunting a giant squid.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.300]   That's a great one.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.060]   The best David Gran New Yorker collection is The Devil in Sherlock Holmes.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.980]   So it's just a collection of his epic New Yorker pieces.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   Really cool writer.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.340]   Only so many people can get away with that.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.340]   He's just really good.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.100]   That's how he gets away with it, but cool book.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.820]   All right, then I read a book called Can Science Explain Everything by John Lennox.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   This was part of the Oxford Apologetics series.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.100]   And so it was talking about what science can and can't explain and the role of religion
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.260]   in a world of scientific worldview.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260]   This was pretty good.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.020]   It was much more of a Christian apologia than I realized.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:20.980]   I thought it was more going to be more philosophical about epistemology, like what science can
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.180]   and can't teach us about the realm or the place for the spiritual.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:29.180]   It's actually much more specific about Christianity than I thought it was going to be.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.180]   But I like this.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.180]   These Oxford series are cool.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.740]   They're basically like extended lecture, smart people write provocative books, and it was
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740]   it was fine.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.500]   This next book, I don't know what I don't know what scoundrel got me this one, but I
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.540]   read a book called Welcome to the Circus of Baseball by Ryan McGee.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:52.060]   This was actually a gift from our illustrious producer, Jesse to myself.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.580]   Jesse, I enjoyed this book.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.580]   I enjoyed it.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.100]   I mean, this is pure.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.860]   Yeah, Mad Dog had a had him on.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.020]   Yeah, Ryan McGee.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.020]   Well, this is just pure nostalgia.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:08.700]   I mean, a book about minor league baseball in the 1990s when I was a kid.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.700]   You know, it's great.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.760]   It makes you want to be like 23 again and just like hanging out and going to ballgames
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.100]   and living cheaply.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.100]   But I enjoyed it.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.140]   It was definitely good choice.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.140]   Bull Durham.
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.140]   Yep.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.140]   Bull Durham.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.420]   I mean, this was the field I guess they use for Bull Durham, Durham, or they film some
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.420]   of it here.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   Oh, really?
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.420]   Yeah, there's definitely connections.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.860]   They might have filmed Bull Durham here.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.900]   I might I might have that wrong.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:35.900]   This is an Asheville.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.460]   This is a minor league team in Asheville, the tourist.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.740]   It's a famous old field where Babe Ruth played.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   It's cool.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.740]   Cool book.
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   Recommend it.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:52.460]   It's called A Long Time Ago in a Cutting Room Far, Far Away by Oscar winning film editor
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Paul Hirsch.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.660]   I actually listened to this one.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.660]   Perfect audible book.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.780]   He's just a very famous film editor.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.540]   He's known for editing Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, but has edited so many famous
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.740]   movies, starting back with I did a lot of early De Palmas, early stuff, Carrie, but
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.660]   also his early experimental movies.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.540]   And I don't know, keep working till today or until recently.
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:18.780]   You know, it's the book is great because it's broken up by movie.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.740]   Now let me talk about editing this movie.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.980]   Now let me talk about editing that movie.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.260]   So it's a great audible format because each new chapter, it's like, OK, we're starting
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.300]   fresh.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.820]   And if you're a movie nerd like I am, you get a lot of cool backstory about what the
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.980]   directors or the talent or the producers were like.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.460]   And I don't know, I loved it.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.380]   I love episodic media books like this.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.020]   So interesting guy.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.020]   You learn a lot about editing.
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   Cool book.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.680]   All right, final book I read, Drowning by T.J.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.640]   Newman.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.880]   So I had read, I think it was called Falling, which was her previous book.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.960]   She's a thriller.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.240]   So it's interesting story.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:00.840]   I love these type of stories where people write thrillers based off of their specific
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.680]   non-writing related career.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.680]   So T.J.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.820]   Newman, I don't know if that's a pen name or not.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.320]   She was a flight attendant.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:13.620]   And so she wrote this book called Falling about a plane being taken hostage and they
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.320]   were going to kidnap the pilot's family.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.940]   So if the pilot didn't crash the plane into a building, they were going to kill his family.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.300]   And a lot of it's from the perspective of the flight attendants and how they deal with
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.300]   it.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.420]   And a lot of real details because she understands how airlines work.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.040]   This also takes place in a plane drowning.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.740]   A plane crashes into the ocean outside of Hawaii.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:44.180]   This fuel spills everywhere and the engine's still running and the people are going out
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.580]   in the life rafts and a few people on board realize, wait a second, this fuel's going
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.500]   to catch on fire.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.100]   The safest place to be is we got to stay inside the sort of floating fuselage because the
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.580]   fuel is catching fire everywhere outside of it.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:01.860]   Long story short, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, but they're alive.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.600]   It has maintained an air pocket.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.460]   So now they're trapped at the bottom of the ocean in the fuselage of a plane and there's
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.460]   a rescue attempt to come now and try to save them.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:19.980]   And it turns out that the ex-wife of the main guy is a underwater welding deep sea construction
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.980]   expert.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.300]   And so it's all about how they're going to try to save them in time.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   Great premise.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.700]   I love that it has all these details about flying.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.700]   Not a super great thriller.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:32.300]   If I'm going to be honest, I'm an aficionado of this genre.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:39.020]   It was pretty good, but I would say they didn't have to work hard to earn it.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.300]   They found it pretty quickly and they were down there pretty quickly.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.820]   It wasn't really until the last 30 pages that they got any real serious stakes going.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.660]   The other thing that wasn't quite working is that the main character, the emotional
[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:56.220]   core of the main character, his youngest kid had died.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:00.860]   And so now that's why he had divorced his wife, who was now in charge of the rescue
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.940]   operation.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.380]   And he was on this flight with their older daughter.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.580]   So they're both trapped down here underwater.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.060]   And so this was supposed to be the emotional motivational cores.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.260]   The whole core to this person was dealing with the fact that he had to deal with a death
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.740]   in his family.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.460]   The problem with that as a core emotional driver is that everyone else on the plane
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.060]   had literally just witnessed hundreds of people die.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:25.900]   And everyone else on the plane, like, oh, my wife just burned up and died.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.900]   Everyone had just died.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.460]   So it was no longer a distinguishing emotional motivator because everyone had that exact
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.620]   same motivation.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:38.940]   And if anything, the people who just had seen next to them, their, you know, fiance die
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.540]   and their parents, like they, in theory, uh, this was way worse and way more fresh than
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:47.300]   someone who had lost a child to, uh, an accident years earlier.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   Right.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.240]   So I think that motivation doesn't hold up.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.820]   If you then put that person in a situation where everyone is facing, uh, just surrounded
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.660]   by death and everyone's dying and everyone just lost someone.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.660]   And so I don't know.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.660]   It was okay.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   It's okay.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.660]   I'm a thriller nerd.
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:05.100]   That one's pretty good, but, uh, I liked falling, falling a little bit better.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.780]   All right, Jesse, I think that's it.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:14.800]   I think we, uh, we've semi successfully completed, you know, our first episode from the new temporary
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.820]   summer HQ up in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.260]   I will continue to improve on the audio and the visual here just because it's something
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.460]   to do, but I'm glad that we're back in action.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:28.380]   So thank you everyone for listening or watching today's episode.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.500]   We'll be back next week with another normal episode of the show.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.580]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.800]   (upbeat music)
