[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, when I left him in March on that day in 1980,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I scarcely knew whether I would see him again.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I hardly thought that it was possible unless I made haste.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   But the truth is, as a number of you well know,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   that not only did we see him again, but we saw him in the pulpit again.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   In May of 1980, he preached in Glasgow.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I could hardly believe that it would be possible, but he was there.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And those who were in that service in Glasgow will not forget it.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   He preached for an hour from the second psalm
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and finished with tremendous earnestness and passion
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   on the words, "Kiss the son lest he be angry,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little."
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   That sermon is on tape.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And after that sermon, he did something that I had never seen him do before.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   He literally, at the end, he had to sink and sit on the pulpit steps,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   quiet, silent, exhausted.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It was an amazing fact that he was there.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And I believe he had gone for any reason, perhaps this above others,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   to help and encourage the many younger ministers who were there,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   men who will speak of it many years hence.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And now here is Dr Lloyd-Jones preaching that remarkable sermon from 1980.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Psalm 2, and I'm going to read it to you.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The kings of the earth set themselves,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and against his anointed, saying,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   'Let us break their bands, O sinner, and cast away their cords fast.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh;
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   the Lord shall have them in derision.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and vex them in his sore displeasure.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I will declare the decree.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   The Lord hath said unto me, 'Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and he perish from the way.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   When his wrath is kindled but a little,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   blessed are all they that put their trust in him."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Now it may well be that there are some here tonight who wonder
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   what that has got to do with our present world situation.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Well, I'm going to show you what it does mean and how relevant it is.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This is, of course, a well-known and a remarkable psalm.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Undoubtedly, it was first of all written and meant to apply
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   to the age in which King David himself lived.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He was dealing with his own contemporary situation primarily.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   But, as you probably all realize and remember, this psalm goes beyond that.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's one of those prophetic messianic psalms.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I asked my friend, the Reverend Alexander, to read that portion
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   from the fourth chapter of the book of Acts, in order that you may see
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   how it was regarded as a prophecy of what happened eventually
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   in the coming of the Son of God into this world.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And you remember how there the early church, faced with not only persecution
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   but with possible extermination, in their prayer to God,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   they quoted this second psalm, showing how relevant it was to their position,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   how they were in a position that was verifying this.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And they used it in their plea to God to come amongst them
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and to grant them deliverance.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And as you remember, God did so.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So, it is a psalm that is always relevant.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   This is one of the great things about the Bible.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's the most contemporary book in the world.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's never out of date.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It always speaks to the precise position in which we find ourselves.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I want to show you how it seems to me to give us in this short space
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   precisely the task that is confronting every one of us at the present time
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   who are at all concerned about the grievous state of affairs
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   in this world at this present moment.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Now, the first thing, of course, we have to realize is this.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We've got to realize what the early church realized,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   that in and of ourselves, we really can do nothing.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   We must do what they did.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   They, you remember, began to pray.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   They lifted up their hearts to God with one accord,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and they put themselves in his hands and pleaded with him to intervene.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And he did intervene.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   He sent his Spirit upon them.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He poured out his Spirit upon them,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and in such a measure that the very building was shaken.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now, these men, you know, were many of them on whom the Spirit had come
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   in great power previously on the day of Pentecost.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But he kept on coming.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And if you are one of those who believe that the Holy Spirit has come
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   once and forever on the day of Pentecost,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and that we shouldn't plead with God to send him again and out,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   and in an outpouring of the Spirit in great profusion,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   well, then our situation is entirely hopeless.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Every revival is but a repetition, in a sense,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   of what happened on the day of Pentecost
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and what happened there as the church was gathered together in that room
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   as described in the fourth chapter of the book of Acts.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And my dear friends, whatever else I may say or may not say tonight,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I hope you will go home with this in your mind and in your heart.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Pray to God without ceasing to make bear his arm,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   to pour out his Spirit upon us again,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   until not only buildings are shaken, until we are shaken,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and we are given the power to preach this word
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   in a manner that shall be irresistible.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Well, that's absolutely basic.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And then, having had this power,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   we must be clear as to what we are to present to the people.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And now I'm going to show you how this second psalm,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   in a most extraordinary manner,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   seems to me to describe our exact position tonight.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It starts off with these words,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   "The kings of the earth set themselves,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   "and the rulers take counsel together
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   "against the Lord and against his anointed saying."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now, this is put in our Bibles in the form of a question.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And in a sense, it is a question.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But I think that even beyond being a question,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   it is an expression of astonishment,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   an expression of horror.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Why do the people--
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   What's the matter?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Why are things as they are?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And you and I have got to start with this question.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Are you amazed? Are you astonished?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That our world is as it is tonight.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   This is our starting point.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And then we come on, you see, to a description of the state of the world.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And here it is.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The heathen rage, and the people imagine--
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   that's the Jews--a vain thing.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Well, here I'm going to show you how apt and how perfect a description it is
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   of conditions at this present time.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The people, the heathen, the world is raging.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   What does this mean?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Well, the authorities are agreed that it's a comparison,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   that it's a reference to a condition which is like the roaring and the raging of the sea.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Now, mankind, in unbelief and apart from God,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   is often referred to in the Bible as being like the sea.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And it is like the sea.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   But you know the sea is something that varies considerably.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And the same has been true of the history of the human race.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   You all know what it is on a fine summer's day to go down to the seashore,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and you look out at the sea.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And you would imagine at first sight that it was absolutely motionless.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It seems quite smooth. It's calm.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   We say it's like a mill pond.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And there doesn't seem to be any movement at all in it.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But there is, of course. The sea is always restless.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's always moving.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   There is always ebb and flow.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's never really at rest.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   But then there are other times when you go down to the same seashore,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and you are looking out at a most terrible storm.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   The billows are raging and hurling.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   The wind is lashing them up.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   The whole sea is in a state of violent turmoil.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Now that, it seems to me, is a parable of what has been true of the human race
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   over its long recorded history.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   There have been times in the history of mankind
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   when everything seemed to be calm and quiet and peaceful.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And mankind was settling down and living at its ease and enjoying itself.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   We read in our history books about the Pax Romana.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   The great Roman Empire was able to keep the then known world in a state of quiet and of peace.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It was like the sea in the summer.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Of course, there was always the movement.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   There was always sin.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   There were always problems and troubles.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   But it was comparatively calm and comparatively quiet.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And there have been other periods in the history of the world
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   when things have been like that.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It was like that, you know, speaking generally,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   during the last century, the time of the so-called Pax Britannica.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   After the Napoleonic War, there was this long period of quiet and of calm.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   There was the Crimean War, but it was a very minor affair and it seemed a long way off.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And it created very little disturbance.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But it was the era of the Pax Britannica.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And most people in this country thought that we'd arrived at a position
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   when there'd be no more war, no more trouble.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Everything was so quiet and so calm and so pleasant.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Of course, there was still the movement.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   There were the moral problems.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   There were sin.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   There were all kinds of disturbances.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   But looking generally at the history of the world,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   it was a time of peace and of calm.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And it continued like that until 1914.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I remember very well the years up to 1914.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And men rarely believed that we'd banished war,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   that we'd never again have a great war.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But, you see, it came.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And by tonight, you and I are in a world in which the heathen are raging.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   We're living in the midst of a storm.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We're in a hurricane.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   We're in an age of violence.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   There's no longer any placidity.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I needn't keep you with this.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   You're all aware of it.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We're in a violent world.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   People have always sinned.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Man sins by nature.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But he's not always violent.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   He's not always raging.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Last century, when men sinned, they were a bit ashamed of it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They tried to do it under the cover of night.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   They didn't want their parents to see it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   They didn't want the minister to see it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   That's no longer the case.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Men and women are sinning openly, violently, bursting about it.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   We're not simply in an age when men and women drink.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   We're in an age of alcoholism.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   We're in an age of drug addiction.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   We're in an age of theft and robbery.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   We're living in an age when it's no longer safe for people,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   young as well as old, to walk the streets at night.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You've read in your papers of Sir Alex Hume and others
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   being molested and attacked and thugged,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   even in underground stations in London and on streets in Chelsea.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   This is the age, my friends, in which we are living.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's an age of violence.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's an age of raging.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It's an age in which men and women are breaking every rule and every law,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   and the whole world is in a state of confusion.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   We've had during this last weekend this phenomenon in London
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   in connection with that embassy of the Iranians,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   and this is happening in other parts of the world.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I'm even weary with this.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   We're in an age of war and rumors of wars, of tumult and of strife,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and who knows what's going to happen.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Things seem to be going from bad to worse.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It is a time indeed in which people are sinning with cart-ropes,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   as an Old Testament phrase puts it,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and we're in this violent situation of raging.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   But there's one more serious thing that we've got to realize.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   It's no use our thinking.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I'm speaking to evangelical people.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   You and I, you know, tend to live sheltered lives,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and many of us don't know what's happening in the world in which we are living.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   We are not to become little ghettos.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   We are living in the world, and we are to know its condition.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   We are to be aware of what is happening,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   the breakdown of the home, breakdown of marriage,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   breakdown of all the sanctities, desecration of the Sabbath,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and of everything that is holy.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   That's the world in which we are living.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But then we come to the second half of his description of the state of affairs.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   The people imagine a vain thing.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Now what does this mean?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well, we've looked at the world,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   and we're reminded of a word that is written by the prophet Isaiah.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   He said, "The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And our world tonight is filled with mire and dirt,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   pollution, corruption, violence, and decay.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And in the midst of this, what are the authorities doing?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And remember, they are the kings and the rulers.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   This doesn't merely apply to the common people.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The kings and the rulers, all the great people, the philosophers, the politicians,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   the educationalists, the scientists, they're all involved in it.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And what are they doing?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   They are imagining vain things.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   What does this mean?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Well, I like very much the translation which puts it like this,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   that they are devising futile and empty schemes.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   With a world which is raging and violent and full of mire and dirt,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   they are devising futile and empty schemes.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Isn't that a perfect description of our world tonight?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Here they are bringing in new bills in Parliament to try to control the situation,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   and they've been doing it for years.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   This is the whole story of civilization.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Man has been attempting to control this evil, this raging, this sin that is so rampant.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And they have put great energy into it, and they're still doing so.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   There are still people who believe in politics,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and that politics can put this world right.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They still have their conferences.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   They've never had so many.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And there are those who are trying to persuade us, evangelicals at the present time,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   that we must pay more attention to politics and social affairs
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   if we want really to influence men and women.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But that's exactly what the people have been doing all along,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   these empty and futile schemes.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I mustn't weary you with them.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   We're all so familiar with them,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   how men have put their faith in education, in culture, in knowledge, in traveling.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   After the First World War, they brought in what was called the League of Nations.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   This was going to banish war.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   The distinguished statesmen had spoken during the war
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   and had said this was the war to end war.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   President Wilson introduced the idea of a League of Nations.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   We were going to banish war.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And people believed that. This was the scheme.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But, of course, the Second War came.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   What then? Well, United Nations organization.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And you read in your papers constantly
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   of people traveling about by jet planes from conference to conference,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Congress to Congress.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   They're going to put the world in order.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   They've put their faith in these vain and empty schemes.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Education, yes, further education.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Spend more money on it. Give the people knowledge.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   These are the things which people have devised.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   But I think that by now, we all are beginning to see
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   that these things are nothing but futile and empty schemes.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   I was reading the other day a statement by a well-known Russian writer of the last century
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   in which he said that history is nothing but the autobiography of a madman.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I read another man who said recently that the state of the world tonight is organized insanity.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It is organized. We've never been so highly organized.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But it's organized insanity.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   An old German writing 300 years ago of the name of Neander,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   he wrote these words,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   "Pride of men and earthly glory, sword and crown betray its trust.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   What with care and toil he buildeth, tower and temple fall to dust."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that's the position in which we find ourselves tonight.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Now, this is not merely the opinion of a little preacher like myself.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You read what some of the ablest men in the world are saying.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   They're not Christians.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Some of the scientists are the most pessimistic men in the world tonight.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   They are saying one after another that we're on the edge of an abyss,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   that we may be sliding rapidly into a final chaos.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   They're losing hope. Why?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Well, because everything has been tried.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   The utopias of which men have written since the time of the ancient Greek philosophers,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   coming down the centuries, men have always believed
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   either that the world is advancing automatically to an ideal state
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   or that by means of our efforts we can produce this.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   But here we are in our much boasted and vaunted 20th century
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   finding ourselves in a collapsing world.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Civilization is failing.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   All the things and the schemes in which we put our faith
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   are failing before our very eyes.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Well, now then, that's the world in which we're operating,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   this society, every church, every Christian.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "What are we to do?" you say.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   "Are you merely here to describe the state of affairs and to send us home depressed?"
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Not at all.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I'm calling attention to this psalm
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   because it gives us the only explanation as to why things are as they are.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   That's the question.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Why do the heathen rage?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Why are the princes and the kings and the great men
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   trusting still to their vain and futile schemes?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Why is this?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And unless you and I have the explanation of it,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   we'll have no solution for it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   You have to diagnose before you treat.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I was reading the other day about some old farmer in Australia
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and he said something that I liked very much.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   He'd bought some new machinery
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   and, of course, the machinery had arrived
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   and with it the instructions as to how it was to be used.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But he and especially his sons and the farm workers,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   they thought they knew all about it
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   and they didn't bother with the instructions.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   They just wanted to handle the machinery.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But after a while something went wrong with the machinery
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and they were able to put it right and they went on.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   But the machinery broke down again
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and they were able to put it right again.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   But then the machinery broke down
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and they were unable to do anything at all about it
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and they didn't know what to do.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   They were at their wit's end.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   The father uttered a word of wisdom.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   He said, "What about reading the instructions?"
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And they read the instructions
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and they discovered immediately what had gone wrong
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   and what could be done about it.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   And what you and I have got to do,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   in the first instance in our modern world,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   is to tell men and women to come back and read the instructions.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   The philosophers don't know what's the matter with the world.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   The scientists don't know.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   You and I who believe the Bible are the only people who know
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and who can know. Why?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Well, because we've got the instructions from the Maker.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And until we come back to the instructions,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   there is no hope whatsoever.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   So what do the instructions tell us?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Well, they start by telling us the cause of our troubles.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Why are we on the edge of this abyss?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Why are we facing the breakdown of morals
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   and all the things that are of greatest and of final value?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And here we are given the answer.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It is all due to man's sin.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   But we've got to be clear as to what sin means.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   There are some very slight and superficial ideas
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   with regard to sin today.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Some people don't even like the idea at all.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   They just think perhaps it's you're doing something
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   that you shouldn't do, and you're sorry afterwards.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   But you know, my friends, the essence of sin,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and it's the main cause of the trouble in the world tonight,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   is rebellion against God.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Listen.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   The kings of the earth set themselves,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and against His anointed, saying,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   "Let us break their bands asunder
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and cast their cords from us."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Now, that is the essence of sin.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   It's not just a weakness in human nature.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It is something deliberate.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And this is the problem in the world tonight.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   It isn't merely that men and women are slack
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and that they're indolent and that they're easygoing.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   No, no. They set themselves together.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   There is an anti-God spirit.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   There is a hatred of God.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   They take counsel together.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   They're utterly opposed to Him,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   and they want to try to get rid of Him and His holy laws.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Now, why do they do this?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   What is the cause of this enmity against God?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And the answer is that they feel that God is against them.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   People's idea of God is of someone in the heavens who's against us,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   wants to rob us of all happiness and joy and peace,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and is always putting us down,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   wants to make us miserable,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   a tyrant that wants to subjugate us and to keep us in shackles.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   That's what they said, you see, then, and they're still saying it,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   about our Lord's holy commandments.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   What they said was this,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "Let us break their bands asunder,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and let us cast away their cords from us."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   What God had given for their benefit, for their use, for their well-being,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   they regarded as bands and as cords.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And this is the modern problem.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   People, you see, regard the Ten Commandments as something against us,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   something that says, "Thou shalt not, thou shalt not, thou shalt not,"
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   standing between us and everything we want to do,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   standing between us and enjoyment and happiness and all that we covet.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   They regard the Ten Commandments as inimical to us
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and to our highest and our best interest.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And this is why the world is in its present state.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   They don't realize, you see, that God gave the Ten Commandments in His grace
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   to restrain sin and evil and to keep evil within bounds.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   That's why He appointed magistrates and governors and all these other things.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   God in His grace has done this to make life possible.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Without law, you have nothing but chaos and utter confusion.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And you and I have got to point this out to the modern men and the modern woman
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   who are objecting to the Ten Commandments and who want to live their free life.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   They shake off their upbringing, which may have been godly.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   They shake off reading the Bible.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   These things they say are against us.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   We want liberty, we want freedom, we want to enjoy ourselves.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And these things they say are against us.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But, my dear friends, let me show you.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   What is your complaint against "Honor thy father and mother"?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Why is that a restriction and a prohibition?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   What's wrong in paying respect to those who have looked after you and cared for you
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   and have been interested in your welfare?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   "Thou shalt not kill."
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   What's wrong with that?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   What's wrong with murder?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Why do men and women want liberty to murder and to shoot?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   What's wrong with "Thou shalt not commit adultery"?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   But people regard these as bans and as cause
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and as something that's set against us, that God is unfair to us.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And coveting your neighbor's wife, bearing false witness against your neighbor.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   All these things that say are against us.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Let's break them free. Let's get loose. Let's do what we like, what we want.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   But you know, my friends, our world is as it is tonight
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   because of that attitude to God's holy commandments.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   If only every man and woman in the world at this moment
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   lived according to the Ten Commandments,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   there'd be no more drunkenness, there'd be no more infidelity,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   no more promiscuity, no more immorality, no more divorce,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   no more little children breaking their hearts at the trouble between father and mother,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   no theft, no robbery, no thuggery.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   If only everybody lived according to God's holy law, the world would be paradise.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   But the world thinks this is against us.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And they say, "Let's break them." And look at their confidence.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   "Let us," they say.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   They set themselves together. They think they can do it.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   They believe that by organizing together, they can really get rid of all this
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and live the life they want to live.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Their fatal self-confidence.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Well, now that, according to the Bible, is the only explanation
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   as to why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   You can no longer say it's due to ignorance.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   We've never been so well educated.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   You no longer can say it's due to lack of education.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   We are having it.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   The media, the papers, the books, they're all providing us with it.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   No, no. There is only one explanation of the state of the world tonight.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Your industrial strife, your class warfare, and all the violence we're witnessing
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   is ultimately due to the lawlessness that emanates from rebellion against almighty God.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   But the psalmist doesn't leave it even at that.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   He goes on then to show us the terrible folly, the madness of setting yourselves together
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and banding yourselves together and taking counsel together against God.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And you and I have got to show men and women that they're mad.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   They don't know it. They don't realize it.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   It's their ignorance of God.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   But this man now proceeds to tell them, you see, what they're doing.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Listen. That's what they say.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Let us break their bends asunder and cast away their cords from us.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   But then, listen, "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   The Lord shall have them in division.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Then shall he speak in his wrath and dex them in his sword displeasure.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Hereto they set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I will declare the decree.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my son this day, and I have begotten thee.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   What does it all mean? Well, it means this.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   That men and women in their madness don't realize that they're not defying men,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   they're not defying preachers or ministers or elders or parents.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   They're defying God.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Who is He?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   He's the one that sitteth in the heavens.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   He's above the flux of time.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   He's the great creator.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And this is what we've got to tell men and women.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Do you remember how one of the psalms, the Metrical Psalms puts it?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   "Before Jehovah's awful throne, ye nations bow, the great nations of the world,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   with their armaments and their bombs and all their great confidence in their might.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Before Jehovah's awful throne, ye nations bow with sacred joy.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Know that the Lord alone is God.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   He can create and He can destroy.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   God sitteth in the heavens."
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You remember how the early church put it in their prayer?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   In their terrible predicament, they turned to Him and they said,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   "Lord, Thou art God, who has made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is."
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And our first business in this age in which we live is to tell men and women about this almighty God,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   the great Jehovah, the one who sits in the heavens and who laughs at petty men and women trying to withstand Him.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   They don't believe in God.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   This is one of the most amazing things to me at the present time.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Men and women, and this is how I can prove their madness to you,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   they're much too learned, they're much too scientific.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   So they tell us to believe in God.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   But you know what they do believe in?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   They believe in what is called the DNA molecule.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   This is an amazing fact about the modern man.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Oh, he's much too intelligent, he's too great a brain to believe in God creating and producing man,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   creating man in His own image and likeness.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   So you go to them and you ask them, "Well, now how do you explain the world?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   How do you explain the universe?"
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Well, they'll tell you that it's all explained in this odd chemical substance which is called the DNA molecule,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   which decides how protoplasm, primitive matter, is to develop and is to multiply.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And they say the whole process of the development of nature to produce man
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   is to be explained in terms of this chemical molecule,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   which hasn't got a mind, it can't think, it can't reason, it can't imagine, it can't plan, it can't have any logic.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   But they believe that.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   They don't believe in God, but they believe in the DNA molecule.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   If that isn't madness, what is madness?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   No, no, my friends.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Men and women are mad and we must tell them that.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   They're dealing with God, who has created everything, who sustains everything.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   He controls the ends of the earth.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   He can give the heathen for an inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth for a possession.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   He's the great Jehovah I Am, I Am that I Am.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   He's the maker, creator, sustainer of all things.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And there He is sitting in the heavens looking upon the folly of mankind.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And He looks upon it, as we are told, with wrath.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   We've got to tell men and women about this.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Do you believe still in Scotland in the wrath of God?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Many in England don't believe it.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   They say this is a terrible idea, this God that sits on Mount Sinai condemning people.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   But the God of the Bible, the creator of the universe, is a God of wrath.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   He never made this world as it is tonight.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   He hates it as it is tonight.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   You remember what Paul said to the Romans?
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Why was he going to preach the gospel to them?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Well, it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Yes, but here's a further reason.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   He says the wrath of God is already revealed from heaven
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   that hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And we've got to tell men that God is still there.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He's still governing.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   He's going to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   His wrath is upon all evil and sin and transgression and law-breaking.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   And he has the power, he has the power to break them with a rod of iron
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and to dash in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   And this Bible is a record of the manifestation of the power of God.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   He manifested it at the flood, which was so similar to this present age,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   with sin raging in its violence.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   God manifested his judgment, and that ancient world was destroyed.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Apart from eight souls.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   He did it many times to his own people when they rebelled against him.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   He sent them off into captivity.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   He gave power to their enemies.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   But you know, above all, he manifested it in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   The clever kings and princes and counsellors, they sat together,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   they counselled together, as the early church said in their prayer,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   against Christ, and they decided to put him to death,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   feeling that if they'd done that, he'd have been got rid of
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and they'd have no more troubles.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And they did kill him, and they buried him, and they put him in a grave,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   and they rolled a stone onto it and sealed it and put soldiers to guard it,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   and they thought they'd got a great victory.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   But he that sitted in the heavens laughed.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   God raised him from the dead,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   making a sport and a spoil of principalities and powers,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   making an open show of them in that very fact of the crucifixion and the resurrection.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   My dear friends, this is the one whom they're defying in their madness
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   and in their folly, not only a holy God, but an all-powerful God.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And yet, they are defying him because they're ignorant of his nature.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   But there's something else which is even more tragic, and that is this.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   The real tragedy of the world and its defiance of God
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   is not merely that they're opposed to his laws and reject his laws.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   What really breaks my heart is this, that they're rejecting his love.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Listen, the kings of the earth set themselves
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   his Messiah, his Deliverer.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   God has not merely given the Ten Commandments.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   God has manifested his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners and rebels,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Christ died for us.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And this is the thing we must point out to men and women
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   as being the most amazing thing of all.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   They're not only rejecting God's holy laws and regarding them as bands and cords,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   they ridicule his love.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   They're laughing at his offer of salvation
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   for God is offering men and women forgiveness of their sins
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   even though they've been so foolish, so mad, so arrogant, so vile.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   God still offers them free pardon and forgiveness
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   We are told here, "Blessed are all they that put their trust in him."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   It is possible for men and women to know this blessedness,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   this happiness, this peace, this being reconciled to God,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   having peace with God, knowing God as our Father,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   having access to him whenever we're in trouble in prayer,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   having a hope of glory which baffles description.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   It is possible for us to live a blessed and a happy and a joyful life in this present world.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   God didn't spare his only Son to make this possible for us.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   He has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   We must tell men and women this and show them that in their madness and folly,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   they're rejecting and spurning this love of God.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   This is the ultimate tragedy, that they're refusing peace, happiness, joy, tranquility,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   conquest over the world, conquest over the fear of death and eternal bliss.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Well then, the final question, and with this I close, is this.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   That being a delineation of the cause of the trouble,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   the explanation of the trouble, the exposure of the madness,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and the tragedy of the world's trouble,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   the world is so unhappy, and it could be happy if it but believed.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   What do we say to them?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   What is the final appeal?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Well, this is this man's final appeal.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Be wise, now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Hiss the sun, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   when his wrath is kindled but a little.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   What are we to do?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Now, my friends, I'm going to speak very plainly.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   There are people in England, God forbid, that you should imitate them here in Scotland.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   There are people here, the people in England, evangelical people, I regret to say,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   who seem to have come to the conclusion that what the modern man needs is entertainment.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   They say, "No, no, the modern man doesn't need preaching."
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   And they're preaching less and less.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   What are they doing?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   They're entertaining the people.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   They're teaching the people to sing.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   This mania for singing.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   They're entertaining people.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   They have their troops.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   They're not only teaching them how to sing, they're teaching them how to act in dramas,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   how to mime the scriptures.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   They're teaching them how to dance.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   This is what they're doing.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   They say, "People today can't take preaching.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   They can't listen to preaching."
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   We must give them what they can understand.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   So we give them singing, dancing, miming, drama, and all these things.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   My dear friends, in the name of God, I say, that is to do violence to the teaching of the scripture.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   We are not here to entertain people.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   The world can entertain.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   The church is always bad at entertaining.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   That's why she's so cool to attempt it.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   We're not called to entertain.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   What are we here to do?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   We are called--we are here to call people to be warriors, to think, to be instructed.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   The preaching of the gospel is not simply a message which tells people to come to Christ
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   or that Jesus loves them or that God loves them.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   No, no.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   It's an appeal to them to be wise because they're mad.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   They're to stop.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   They're to think.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   They're to reason.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   They're to be instructed.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   We are to teach.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   We are to preach to all and sundry, great and small, kings, judges,
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   and all the people on the face of the earth.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   My people are dying through lack of knowledge, says Hosea, and it's true today.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   We are not here to be popular.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   We are here to tell people the naked truth and to warn them before it is too late.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   You notice how it is put here in a very striking manner.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   Having told them to be wise, to think, and to be instructed,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   and to consider their latter end and to face the facts,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   we tell them to serve the Lord with fear and to rejoice,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   not with a carefree, light and flippant attitude as we dance on our stages.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   No, but to rejoice with trembling.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Our God is a consuming fire, and we are to serve him with reverence and godly fear.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   That doesn't mean that we're miserable wretches.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   That doesn't mean that we're pompous in our solemnity.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Not at all.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   The Apostle Paul was one of the most serious men the world has ever known,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   but he knew a joy that is an exception in Christians.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Why are we to tell them to serve the Lord with fear and to rejoice with trembling?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   The answer is this.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We are to urge them to kiss the sun, lest he be angry and he perish from the way,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   when his wrath is kindled but a little.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   We are to invite people to come to the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   and to kiss him and to serve him with fear.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   I like this image.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   You've read, haven't you, how after a general election there is a new government.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   And what happens?
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Well, all the members of the new government have to go to the Queen in Buckingham Palace
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   to take office.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   And what do they do?
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   They give a kiss of allegiance.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   They bend before her and they kiss her hand.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   A sign of allegiance, a sign of submission,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   and she gives them the authority to govern.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   That's what you and I have got to do with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   There he is. God has sent him.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   And there it is, this amazing offer of salvation.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   We are to call men and women to bow before him,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   to kiss the sun,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   give themselves to him in allegiance and in service.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Why?
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Lest he perish from the way,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   when his wrath is kindled but a little.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   This to me is a terrible prayer.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   It's terribly true of the world tonight.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Do you know what we are witnessing in our world tonight?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   I can tell you.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   We are witnessing the wrath of God the Father and the Son
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   when it is kindled but a little.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   The only way I can explain the 20th century
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   with its two world wars,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   with all the calamities,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   with all the concentration camps,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   the world as it is tonight,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   shivering on the brink of the abyss.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   What is this?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   I say this is a manifestation of the wrath of God
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   when it is kindled but a little.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   It is the wrath of God.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   As you can read in the second half
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   there are times in the history of the world
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   according to the Apostle Paul,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   when God abandons men and women.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   He hands them over to a reprobate mind.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   It's a manifestation of his wrath.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   The wrath of God is already revealed
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   and unrighteousness of men.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   And one of the ways in which God manifests his wrath
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   is to withdraw his restraining influences.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   And I believe he's doing that tonight.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   We in our cleverness have said
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   we can make a world without God.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   And we've been confident.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   We've set ourselves.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   We've taken counsel together.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   We've been defying God.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   What is God doing?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   God is saying to us through present circumstances,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   get on with it.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   If you can live without me, live without me.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   If you can make a perfect society without me,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   and my laws, get on with it. Do it.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   He's abandoning us.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   He's handing us over to a reprobate mind.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   But this is but a manifestation of the wrath of God
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   when it is kindled but a little.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   And we must warn people to think, to reason,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   to consider all this, and to be wise.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Because a day is coming
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   when the wrath of God
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   will not be manifested and revealed
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   and kindled but a little,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   but all the vials of his wrath
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   will be poured out together.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   And these wretched kings and princes
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   at that day will cry unto the rocks and to the mountains,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   "Fall on us and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb."
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Men and women, this is what we've got to tell
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   these perishing masses round and about us.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   We don't stop merely at condemning them.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   We are here to warn them,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   to plead with them, to think, to be wise,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   to reason, to consider.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Tell them about God and his holiness and his might,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   his wrath and his love.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   And plead with them to escape from the wrath to come
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   by kissing the Son,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   by yielding themselves to him,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   by serving him with fear,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   and rejoicing with trembling.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Assuring them in the meantime
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   that blessed are all they
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   that put their trust in him.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   God forbid that we should be misled by this delusion
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   that we are to give the people what they want,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   that we are to entertain people.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   This is our commission.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Here are the instructions.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   This is the only way
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   in which men can find peace,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   happiness, joy, tranquility,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   and lose the fear of death,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   and look with joy and anticipation
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   to the glory that awaits us all
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   in the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   in our everlasting home.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   May God fill the members of the SEC
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   and all ministers, preachers, and true Christians
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   with this message
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   and with the power of the Spirit upon it
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   that we may save some souls
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   under the hands of God
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   while his wrath is kindled but a little
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   before the day of final vengeance and judgment
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   dawns upon us.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   God bless us to that great and glorious end.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Amen.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
