[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   the war continues after the battles end.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.520]   This is something that's hard for Americans to understand.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.160]   Our system is built with the presumption
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.640]   when war is over, when we sign a piece of paper,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.680]   everyone can go home.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.760]   It's not what happens.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.400]   - The following is a conversation with Jeremy Suri,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.920]   a historian at UT Austin.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.800]   This is the "Alex Friedman Podcast."
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.040]   in the description.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.840]   And now, dear friends, here's Jeremy Suri.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.200]   What is the main idea,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.640]   the main case that you make in your new book,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.360]   "Civil War by Other Means,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.520]   "America's Long and Unfinished Fight for Democracy."
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.480]   - So our democratic institutions in the United States,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   they are filled with many virtues
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.200]   and many elements in their design
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.080]   that improve our society and allow for innovation.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.640]   But they also have many flaws in them,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.520]   as any institutions created by human beings have.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   And the flaws in our institutions go back
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840]   to a number of judgments and perspectives
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   that people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries had.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.200]   And those flaws have been built into our institutions,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.160]   and they continue to hinder innovation
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.720]   and growth in our society.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   Three of the flaws that I emphasize in this book
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.120]   are flaws of exclusion,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.760]   the ways our institutions exclude people,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.540]   not just African-Americans, many different groups.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.720]   The ways our institutions also give power
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.800]   to certain people who have position
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.560]   rather than skill or intelligence or quality.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.680]   And third, and most of all,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.360]   the ways our institutions embed certain myths in our society,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260]   myths that prevent us from gaining the knowledge
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.960]   we need to improve our world.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.860]   In all of these ways,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.600]   our democracy is hindered by the false reverence
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.680]   for institutions that actually need to be reformed,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.900]   just as we need to highlight the good elements of them.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.160]   That's really what my book is about.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.680]   - And then the myth, the false reverence,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.880]   what are we talking about there?
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   - So there's a way in which we believe
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.260]   that if we love our country,
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.960]   it's somehow wrong to criticize our institutions.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.880]   I believe if you love your country,
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.320]   you want to encourage your institutions
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.240]   to get better and better.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.920]   I love my university where I work,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.760]   but I want it to be better.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.800]   We have many flaws.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.640]   I love my family,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.120]   but I'm constantly telling family members
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.920]   how they can be better.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.400]   That's what true knowledge leadership is about,
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.720]   not just cheerleading.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.000]   - What's the counterpoint to that?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.200]   'Cause the other extreme is a deep,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.160]   all-encompassing cynicism towards institutions.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.120]   So for me, I like the idea of loving America,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.680]   which seems to be sometimes a politicized statement
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.640]   these days that you believe in the ideals of this country.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.880]   That seems to be either a naive or a political statement,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.840]   the way it's interpreted.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.440]   So the flip side of that,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   having a healthy skepticism of institutions is good,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.880]   but having a complete paralyzing cynicism seems to be bad.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   - Absolutely, both are ahistorical positions.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.200]   What I try to do as a historian
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.680]   is work in between those spaces.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.000]   The virtue is in the middle ground,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.280]   for better or for worse.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.640]   And what we have to recognize
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.120]   is that our institutions are necessary.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.280]   There's a reason government exists.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.440]   There's a reason our union was created.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.720]   That's what Abraham Lincoln was heroically fighting for.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.400]   So we have to believe in our union.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840]   We have to believe in our government.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.040]   And we as business people, as intellectuals,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   we have to be part of the solution, not the problem.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.000]   But that doesn't mean just ignoring
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.440]   the deep flaws in our institutions,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.360]   even if we find personally ways to get around them.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.760]   What really worries me is that there are a lot of
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.160]   very intelligent, well-intentioned people in our society
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.680]   who have figured out how to live with the flaws
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   in our institutions, rather than how to use their skills
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.720]   to correct the flaws in our institutions.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.400]   - There's folks like somebody that lives next door to me,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.240]   Michael Malice, is an anarchist.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.800]   Philosophically, maybe more than practically,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.960]   just sort of argues for that position.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.280]   It's an interesting thought experiment, I would say.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.040]   And so if you have these flaws in institutions,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   one thing to do, as the communists did
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.240]   at the beginning of the 20th century,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.200]   is to burn the thing down and start anew.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.040]   And the other is to fix from within,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   one step, one slow step at a time.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.560]   What's the case for both from a history perspective?
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.000]   - Sure, so historically, there has always been an urge
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   to burn down the institutions and start again,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.440]   start with a blank slate.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.800]   The historical record is that almost never works.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   Because what happens when you destroy the institutions,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.200]   you gave the example of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   When you destroy the institutions,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.400]   all you do is in the jungle that's left behind,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.080]   you give advantages to those who are the most powerful.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   Institutions always place certain limits
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.720]   upon the most powerful in the jungle.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.160]   If you go back to the jungle,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.240]   the most powerful are actually going to have
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.080]   the most influence and most control.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.160]   So the revolutionaries who are usually the vulnerable
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.240]   turn out to then be the victims of the revolution.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.680]   And this is exactly what we saw with the French Revolution,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.960]   with the Russian Revolution.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.880]   So the record for that is not a great record.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   There still might be times to do that.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.760]   But I think we should be very cautious about that.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   The record for working through institutions
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   is a much better record.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.800]   Now, what we have to be careful about
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   is as we're working through institutions,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.120]   not to become bought into them,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.440]   not to become of those institutions.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.160]   So what I've written about in this book
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   and in other books, my book on Henry Kissinger, for example,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.120]   is how it's important when in an institution
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.480]   to still bring an outsider perspective.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.600]   I believe in being an inside outsider.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.720]   And I think most of your listeners are inside outsiders.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   They're people who care about what's going on inside,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.120]   but they're bringing some new ideas from the outside.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.360]   - I think the correct statement to say
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.000]   is most of the listeners, most people,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   aspire to be inside or outsiders.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.000]   But we, human nature is such
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   that we easily become inside or insiders.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.160]   So like, we like that idea, but the reality is,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.520]   and I've been very fortunate because of this podcast
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.720]   to talk to certain folks that live in certain bubbles.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.600]   And it's very hard to know when you're in a bubble
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.320]   that you should get out of the bubble of thought.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.520]   And that's a really tricky thing because like, yeah,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   when you're, whether it's politics,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   whether it's science, whether it's any pursuits in life,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.360]   because everybody around you, all your friends,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   you have like a little rat race
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.280]   and you're competing with each other.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   And then you get a promotion, you get excited,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.720]   and you can see how you can get more and more power.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320]   It's not like a dark, cynical rat race.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.600]   It's fun.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.200]   That's the process of life.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   And then you forget that you just collectively
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.120]   have created a set of rules for the game
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   that you're playing.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.800]   You forget that this game doesn't have to have these rules.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.900]   You can break them.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.960]   This happens in like in Wall Street,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.920]   like the financial system,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.040]   everybody starts to like collectively agree
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.560]   on a set of rules that they play.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.800]   And they don't realize like,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.440]   we don't have to be playing this game.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.280]   It's tough.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.480]   It's really tough.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.080]   It takes a special kind of human being
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.760]   as opposed to being anti-establishment on everything,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.840]   which also gets a lot of attention.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.200]   But being just enough anti-establishment
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.880]   to figure out ideas how to improve the establishment.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.040]   That's such a tricky place to operate.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.880]   - I agree.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.120]   I like the word iconoclastic.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.520]   I think it's important to be an iconoclast,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.080]   which is to say you love ideas,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.520]   you're serious about ideas,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   but you're never comfortable with consensus.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.000]   And I write about that in this book.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.080]   I've written about that actually a lot
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.160]   in the New York Times too.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.960]   I think consensus is overstated.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.240]   As someone who's half Jewish and half Hindu,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.160]   I don't wanna live in a society where everyone agrees
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.880]   'cause my guess is they're gonna come after people like me.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.400]   I wanna live in a society that's pluralistic.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.320]   This is what Abraham Lincoln was really fighting for
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.160]   in the Civil War.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.400]   It's what the Civil War is really about
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.240]   and what my book's about,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.800]   which is that we need a society
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.560]   where institutions encourage, as you say,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.120]   different modes of thought
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.680]   and respect different modes of thought
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.240]   and work through disagreement.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.000]   So a society should not be a society where everyone agrees.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.600]   A democratic society should be a society
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.080]   where people disagree but can still work together.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.200]   That's the Lincoln vision.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And how do you get there?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.480]   I think you get there by having a historical perspective,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.080]   always knowing that no matter what moment you're in
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.880]   and no matter what room you're in with really smart people,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.720]   there are always things that are missing.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.480]   We know that as historians.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.920]   No one is clairvoyant and the iconoclast
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.880]   is looking for the things that have been forgotten,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.000]   the silences in the room.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   - And also, I wonder what kind of skill,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.200]   what kind of process is required for the iconoclast
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.480]   to reveal what is missing to the rest of the room?
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.200]   Because it's not just shouting with a megaphone
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.040]   that something is missing
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.000]   'cause nobody will listen to you.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   You have to convince them.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.240]   - Right.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.160]   It's honestly where I have trouble myself
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.000]   'cause I often find myself in that iconoclastic role
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.200]   and people don't like to hear it.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.880]   I like to believe that people are acting out of goodwill,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.240]   which I think they usually are,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   and that people are open to new ideas,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.320]   but you find very quickly,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.080]   even those who you think are open-minded,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.760]   once they've committed themselves and put their money
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.640]   and their reputation on the line,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.840]   they don't wanna hear otherwise.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.280]   So in a sense, what you say is bigger
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.200]   than even being an iconoclast.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.080]   It's being able to persuade and work with people
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.680]   who are afraid of your ideas.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.000]   - Yeah, I think the key is, like in conversations,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   is to get people out of a defensive position,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.240]   like make them realize we're on the same side,
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.400]   we're brothers and sisters, and from that place,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.160]   I think you just raise the question.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.880]   It's like a little thought that just lands,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.120]   and then I've noticed this time and time again,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.680]   just a little subtle thing, and then months later,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.280]   it percolates somewhere in the mind.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.960]   It's like, all right, that little doubt,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.240]   because I also realize in these battles,
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.680]   especially political battles,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.640]   people often don't have folks on their side
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   like that they can really trust as a fellow human being
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.200]   to challenge them.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.000]   That's a very difficult role to be in,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.240]   and because in these battles, you kinda have a tribe
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.000]   and you have a set of ideas, and there's another tribe,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.160]   and you have a set of ideas,
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.040]   and when somebody says something counter to your viewpoint,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.960]   you almost always wanna put them in the other tribe
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.520]   as opposed to having, truly listening to another person.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.240]   That takes skill, but ultimately, I think that's the way
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.440]   to bridge these divides
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   is having these kinds of conversations.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.960]   That's why I'm actually, again, optimistically believe
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.800]   in the power of social media to do that
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.400]   if you design it well,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.000]   but currently, the battle rages on on Twitter.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.800]   - Well, I think what you're getting at,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   which is so important, is storytelling,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.200]   and all the great leaders that I've studied,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.680]   some of whom are in this book, some of whom are not,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.800]   whether they're politicians, social activists,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.600]   technologists, it's the story that gets people in.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.040]   People don't respond to an argument.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.920]   We're trained, at least in the United States,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   we're often trained to argue.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.280]   You're told in a class, okay, this part of the room,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.360]   take this position, this part of the room,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.920]   take this position, and that's helpful
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.520]   because it forces you to see different sides
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.200]   of the argument, but in fact, those on one side
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.880]   never convince those on the other side through argument.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.400]   It's through a story that people can identify with.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's when you bring your argument to life in human terms,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.760]   and someone, again, like Abraham Lincoln
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   was a master at that.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.440]   He told stories.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.920]   He found ways to disarm people and to move them
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.600]   without their even realizing they were being moved.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.680]   - Yeah, not make it a debate, make it tell a story.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.320]   That's fascinating 'cause yes,
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.520]   some of the most convincing politicians,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.080]   I don't feel like they're arguing a point.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.760]   They're just telling a story,
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.800]   and it gets in there, right?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.560]   I mean, when we look at what Zelensky has done in Ukraine
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.640]   in response to the Russian invasion,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.340]   and I know you were there on the front lines yourself,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.280]   it's not that he's arguing a position that persuaded us.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.960]   We already believe what we believed about Russia,
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.040]   but he's bringing the story of Ukrainian suffering to life
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.960]   and making us see the behavior of the Russians
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.200]   that is moving opinion around the world.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.400]   - Well, the interesting stuff,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.440]   sometimes it's not actually the story told by the person,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.320]   but the story told about the person.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.000]   And some of that could be propaganda.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   Some of that could be legitimate stories,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.000]   which is the fascinating thing.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.200]   The power of story is the very power
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   that's leveraged by propaganda to convince the populace.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.640]   But the idea, one of the most powerful ideas
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.280]   when I traveled in Ukraine,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.160]   and in general to me personally,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   the idea that President Zelensky stayed in Kiev
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.200]   in the early days of war,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.800]   when everybody from his inner circle to the United States,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.040]   everybody in the Western NATO,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.000]   everybody was telling him,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.680]   and even on the Russian side,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.080]   I assume they thought he would leave, he would escape,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.960]   and he didn't.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.140]   From foolishness or from heroism, I don't know.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.560]   But that's a story that I think united a country,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.680]   and it's such a small thing, but it's powerful.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.440]   - It's the most basic of all human stories,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   the story of human courage.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.800]   - Yeah, courage.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.120]   I remember watching his social media feed on that,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.560]   and he was standing outside, not even in a bunker,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.240]   standing outside in Kiev, right,
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.160]   as the Russian forces are attacking and saying,
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.720]   "I'm here, and this minister is here,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.600]   "and this minister is here.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.040]   "We're not corrupt.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.960]   "We're not stooges of the Americans who told us to leave.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.360]   "We're staying because we care about Ukraine."
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.280]   And the story of courage, I mean,
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.000]   that's the story that babies grow up
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   seeing their parents as courageous, right?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.920]   It's the most natural of all stories.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.800]   - And it's also the stories, for better or worse,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.680]   that are told throughout history.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.720]   - Yeah.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   - Because stories of courage and stories of evil,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.680]   those are the two extremes, are the ones that are kinda,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.480]   it's a nice mechanism to tell the stories of wars,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.240]   of conflicts, of struggles, all of it.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.480]   - The tension between those two.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.080]   - And the reason I believe studying history
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.360]   and writing about history is so essential
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.840]   is because it gives us more stories.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.040]   The problem with much of our world, I think,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.960]   is that we're confronted by data,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.880]   we're confronted by information,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.560]   and of course it's valuable,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.440]   but it's easy to manipulate or misuse information.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   It's the stories that give us a structure.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.120]   It's the stories where we find morality.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.640]   It's the stories where we find political value.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.880]   And what do you get from studying history?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.640]   You learn more stories about more people.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.920]   - Yeah, I'm a sucker for courage, for stories of courage.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.320]   Like I've been in too many rooms,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   I've often seen too many people sort of in subtle ways
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.880]   sacrifice their integrity and did nothing.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   And people that step up when the opinion is unpopular
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   and they do something where they really put themselves
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.200]   on the line, whether it's their money,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.520]   whether it's their wellbeing, I don't know.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.420]   That gives me hope about humanity.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.560]   And of course, during a war like Ukraine,
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   you see that more and more.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.240]   Now, other people have a very cynical perspective of it
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.200]   that saying, oh, those are just narratives
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.440]   that are constructed for propaganda purposes and so on.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.000]   But I've seen it with my own eyes.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.440]   There's heroes out there, both small and big.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.160]   So just regular citizens and leaders.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.320]   - One set of heroes I learned about writing this book
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.080]   that I didn't know about that I should have
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.600]   are more than 100,000 former slaves
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.000]   who become Union soldiers during a civil war.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.040]   It's an extraordinary story.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.440]   We think of it as North versus South,
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.360]   white Northern troops versus white Southern troops.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.440]   There are, as I said, more than 100,000 slaves,
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.160]   no education, never anything other than slaves
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.560]   who flee their plantations, join the Union Army.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.720]   And what I found in the research,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.160]   and other historians have written about this too,
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.240]   is they become some of the most courageous soldiers
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.880]   because they know what they're fighting for,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.960]   but there's something more to it than that.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.240]   It seems in their stories that there is a humanity,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.200]   a human desire for freedom
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.560]   and a human desire to improve oneself,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.400]   even for those who have been denied
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.320]   even the most basic rights for all of their lives.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.160]   And I think that story should be inspiring to all of us
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   as a story of courage,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.360]   'cause we all deal with difficulties,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.120]   but none of us are starting from slavery.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.840]   - That's really powerful, that flame,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.680]   the longing for freedom can't be extinguished
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.160]   through the generations of slavery.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.280]   So that's something you talk about.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.400]   There's some deep sense in which,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.240]   while the war was about, in part about slavery,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   it's not, the slaves themselves fought for their freedom
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.440]   and they won their freedom.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.040]   - I don't think it's a war about slavery.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.720]   I think it's a war about freedom.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.800]   Because if you say it's a war about slavery,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.560]   then it sounds like it's an argument
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.920]   between the slave masters and the other white guys
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.240]   who didn't want slavery to exist.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.640]   And of course that argument did exist,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.800]   but it wasn't, it was a war over freedom,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.760]   especially after 1863 into the second year of the war
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.120]   when Lincoln, because of war pressures,
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.440]   signs the Emancipation Proclamation,
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.080]   which therefore says that the contraband,
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.480]   the property of Southerners, i.e. their slaves,
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.080]   will now be freed and brought into the Union Army.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.680]   That makes it about freedom.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.440]   Already the slaves were leaving the plantations.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.840]   They knew what was going on
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.240]   and they were gonna get out of slavery
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.520]   as soon as they could.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.040]   But now it becomes a war over freeing them,
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.680]   over opening that opportunity for them.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.880]   And that's how the war ends.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.120]   That's really important, right?
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   And that's where we are in our politics today.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.840]   It's the same debate.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.680]   It's why I wrote this book.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.480]   The challenge of our time is to understand
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.360]   how do we make our society open to more freedom
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.960]   for more people?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.840]   - So let's go to the beginning.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.560]   How did the American Civil War start and why?
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.360]   - So the American Civil War starts
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.160]   because of our flawed institutions.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.160]   The founders had mixed views of slavery,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.840]   but they wanted a system that would eventually work its way
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.360]   toward opening for more people of more kinds.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.600]   Not necessarily equality,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.880]   but they wanted a more open democratic system.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.480]   But our institutions were designed in ways
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.200]   that gave disproportionate power to slave holders
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.280]   in particular states in the Union.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.880]   Through the Senate, through the Electoral College,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.440]   through many of the institutions we talk about
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.280]   in our politics today.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.680]   Therefore, that part of the country
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   was in the words of Abraham Lincoln,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.080]   holding the rest of the country hostage.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.720]   For a poor white man like Abraham Lincoln,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.320]   born in Kentucky, who makes his way in Illinois,
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.360]   slavery was an evil, not just for moral reasons.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.120]   It was an evil because it denied him democratic opportunity.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.840]   Why would anyone hire poor Abe to do something
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.400]   if they could get a slave to do it for free?
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.760]   And his economy of opportunity for him
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.840]   had to be an economy that was open
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.000]   and that did not have slavery,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.160]   particularly in the new states
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.040]   that were coming into the Union.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.000]   Lincoln was one of the creators of the Republican Party,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.120]   which was a party dedicated to making sure
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.320]   all new territory was open to anyone
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.720]   who was willing to work, any male figure,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.760]   who would be paid for their work.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.120]   Free labor, free soil, free men, basic capitalism.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.800]   Southerners, Southern plantation owners
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.400]   were an aristocracy that did not want that.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.560]   They wanted to use slavery
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.840]   and expand slavery into the new territories.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   What caused the Civil War?
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   The clash and our institutions that were unable to adapt
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.880]   and continue to give disproportionate power
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.280]   to these Southern plantation slave owners.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.880]   The Supreme Court was dominated by them.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   Senate was dominated by them.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.960]   And so the Republican Party came into power
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.240]   as a critique of that.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   And Southerners unwilling to accept,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.460]   Southern Confederates unwilling to accept that change
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.240]   went to war with the Union.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.480]   - So who was on each side, the Union Confederates?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.640]   What are we talking about?
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.560]   What are the states?
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.700]   How many people?
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:25.320]   What's like the demographics and the dynamics of each side?
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.760]   - The Union side is much, much larger, right?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.000]   In terms of population, I think about 22 million people.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200]   And it is what we would today recognize
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.720]   as all the states basically North of Virginia.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.340]   The South is the states in the South
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.620]   of the Mason-Dixon line.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.220]   So Virginia and there on South, West through Tennessee.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.260]   So Texas, for example, is in the Confederacy.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.640]   Tennessee is in the Confederacy.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.320]   But other states like Missouri are border states.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.260]   And the Confederacy is a much smaller entity.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.300]   It's made up of about 9 million people
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.260]   plus about 4 million slaves.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.980]   And it is a agricultural economy,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.020]   whereas the Northern economy
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.240]   is a more industrializing economy.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.140]   Interestingly enough, the Confederate states
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.140]   are in some ways more international
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.600]   than the Northern states
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.000]   because they are exporters of cotton, exporters of tobacco.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.680]   So they actually have very strong
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.000]   international economic ties,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.880]   very strong ties to Great Britain.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.800]   The United States was the largest source of cotton
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   to the world before the Civil War.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.640]   Egypt replaces that a little bit during the Civil War.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.360]   But all the English textiles were American cotton
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.600]   from the South.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.360]   And so it is the Southern half of what we would call
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.120]   the Eastern part of the United States today
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.560]   with far fewer people.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.480]   It's made up, the Confederacy is, of landed families.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.240]   Wealth in the Confederacy was land and slaves.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.140]   The Northern United States is made up
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.000]   predominantly of small business owners
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.240]   and then larger financial interests,
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.740]   such as the banks in New York.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.240]   - And what about the military?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.560]   Who are the people that picked up guns?
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.520]   What are the numbers there?
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.360]   So the Union also outnumbered the Confederacy.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.440]   - By far, but it is a really interesting question
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.040]   because there's no conscription in the Constitution.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.900]   Unlike most other countries,
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.300]   our democracy is formed on the presumption
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.800]   that human beings should not be forced
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.720]   to go into the military if they don't want to.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.120]   Most democracies in the world today
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.400]   actually still require military service.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.940]   The United States has very rarely in its history done that.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.560]   It's not in our Constitution.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.920]   So during the Civil War,
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.320]   in the first months and years of the Civil War,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.580]   Abraham Lincoln has to go to the different states,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.880]   to the governors, and ask the governors for volunteers.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   So the men who take up arms,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.000]   especially in the first months of the war,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.200]   are volunteers in the North.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.000]   In the South, they're actually conscripted.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.800]   And then as the war goes on,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   the Union will pass the Conscription Acts of 1862 and 1863,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.920]   which for the first time,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.760]   and this is really important
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.560]   'cause it creates new presidential powers,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.400]   for the first time,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.720]   Lincoln will have presidential power
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.920]   to force men into the army,
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.120]   which is what leads to all kinds of draft riots
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.240]   in New York and elsewhere.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.080]   But suffice it to say,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.580]   the Union Army throughout the war
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.360]   is often three times the size of the Confederate Army.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.200]   - What's the relationship between this no conscription
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.720]   and people standing up to fight for ideas
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.320]   and the Second Amendment?
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.680]   A well-regulated militia being necessary
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.280]   to the security of a free state,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.520]   the right of the people to keep and bear arms
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.900]   shall not be infringed.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.740]   We're in Texas.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.580]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.440]   - What's the role of that in this story?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.960]   - The American population is already armed before the war.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.460]   And so even though the Union and the Confederate Armies
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.040]   will manufacture and purchase arms,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.640]   it is already an armed population.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.260]   So the American presumption going into the war
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.780]   is that citizens will not be forced to serve,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.100]   but they will serve in militias
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.700]   to protect their own property.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.660]   And so the Second Amendment,
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.680]   the key part of the Second Amendment for me as a historian
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.600]   is the well-regulated militia part.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.580]   The presumption that citizens as part of their civic duty
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.100]   do not have a duty to join a national army,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.580]   Prussian style,
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.340]   but are supposed to be involved
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.460]   in defending their communities.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.220]   And that's the reality.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.700]   It's also a bit of a myth.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.860]   And so Americans have throughout their history
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.460]   been gun owners,
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.020]   not AK-47 owners, but gun owners.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.240]   And gun ownership has been for the purpose
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.180]   of community self-defense.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.260]   The question coming out of that is,
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.100]   what does that mean in terms of,
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.380]   do you have access to everything?
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.780]   Antonin Scalia even himself asked this question
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.020]   on the Supreme Court.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.860]   He said, in one of the gun cases,
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.540]   you have the right to defend yourself,
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.420]   but you don't have the right to own an Uzi.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.780]   You don't have the right to have a tank.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.860]   I don't think they'd let you park a tank, Lex,
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.300]   in your parking spot, right?
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.140]   - I looked into this.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.880]   I think there's a gray area around tanks, actually.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.860]   I think you're legit allowed to own a tank.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.700]   - Oh, you really?
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.180]   - I think there's, somebody look into this,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.220]   'cause somebody told me,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.140]   but I could see that,
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.340]   'cause it's very difficult for that to get out of hand.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.260]   - Right, right.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.340]   - Okay, there may be one guy in a tank.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.060]   You could be breaking laws in terms of the width
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.780]   of the vehicle that you're using to operate.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.020]   Anyway, that's a hilarious discussion.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.740]   But, so then to make the case,
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.740]   speaking of AK-47s and rifles,
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.380]   and back to Ukraine for a second,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.860]   one of the fascinating social experiments
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.940]   that happened in Ukraine at the beginning of the war
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   is they handed out guns to everybody, rifles,
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.380]   and crime went down,
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.660]   which I think is really interesting.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.960]   - Yeah.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.040]   - I hope somebody does a kind of psychological
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.520]   data collection analysis effort here
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.260]   to try to understand why.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.640]   Because it's not obvious to me that in a time of war,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.740]   if you give guns to the entire populace,
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.020]   anyone who wants a gun,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.340]   it's not going to,
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   especially in a country who has historically
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.820]   suffered from corruption,
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.740]   not result in robberies and assaults
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.060]   There's a deep lesson there.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.740]   Now, I don't know if you can extend that lesson
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.100]   beyond wartime, though.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.940]   - Right, that's the question,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.060]   what happens after the war?
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.060]   I mean, my inclination would be to say
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.100]   that can work during war,
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.560]   but you have to take the guns back after the war.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.560]   (laughing)
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.720]   - But they might be very upset when you try to take--
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.560]   - That's the problem.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.840]   No, that's precisely the problem.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.480]   That's actually part of the story here.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.240]   I mean, what happens after the Civil War,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.740]   after Appomattox in 1865,
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.000]   is that many Southern soldiers go home with their guns
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.440]   and they misuse their weapons
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.280]   to, quite frankly, shoot and intimidate former slaves
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.320]   who are now citizens.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.160]   And this is a big problem.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.920]   I talk about this in the book in Memphis in 1866.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.340]   It is former Confederate soldiers and police officers
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.740]   and judges who are responsible for hundreds of rapes
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.100]   within a two-day period
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.660]   and destroying an entire community of African-Americans.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.860]   And they're able to do that
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.540]   because they brought their guns home.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.080]   - But underneath the issue of guns there
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.980]   is just the fundamental issue of hatred
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   and inability to see other humans in this world
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.540]   as having equal value as another human being.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.980]   What was the election of 1860 like
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.380]   that brought Lincoln to power?
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.460]   - So the election of 1860 was a very divisive election.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.620]   We have divisive contested elections
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.620]   from 1860 really until 1896.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.660]   The 1860 election is the first election
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.340]   where a Republican is elected president, that is Lincoln,
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.160]   but he's elected president with less than 40% of the vote
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.380]   because you have two sets of Democrats running,
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.260]   Democrats who are out to defend the Confederacy
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.560]   and everything, and then Democrats who want to compromise
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.300]   but still keep slavery.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.040]   Most famous Stephen Douglas,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.720]   who argues for basically allowing each state
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.700]   to make its own decisions, popular sovereignty,
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.740]   as he called it.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.820]   And then you still have traditional Whigs who are running.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.380]   That was the party that preceded the Republican Party.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.780]   So you have four candidates.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.140]   Lincoln wins a plurality.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.320]   Lincoln is elected largely because the states
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.200]   that are anti-slavery or anti-expansion of slavery
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.800]   are not a majority, but they're a plurality.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.280]   And the other states have basically factionalized.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.540]   And so they're unable to have a united front against him.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.640]   - Was the main topic at hand slavery?
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.560]   - I think the main topic at hand at that time
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.480]   was the expansion of slavery into new territories.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.320]   - Into new territory.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.120]   - Right, it was not whether to abolish slavery or not,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   Lincoln is very careful
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.320]   and his correspondence is clear.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.720]   He wants no one on his side during the election
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.120]   to say that he's arguing for abolitionism,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.320]   even though he personally supported that.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.960]   What he wants to say is the Republican Party
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.240]   is for no new slave territories.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.600]   - Did he make it clear that he was for abolition?
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.380]   - No, he was intentionally unclear about that.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.360]   - Do you think he was throughout his life?
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   Was there a deep...
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.000]   Because that takes quite a vision.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.520]   Like you look at society today
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.360]   and it takes quite a man to see
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.440]   that there's something deeply broken
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.120]   where a lot of people take for granted.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.440]   I mean, into modern day, you could see factory farming.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.280]   It's one of those things that in a hundred years
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.320]   we might see as like the torture,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.080]   the mass torture of animals could be seen as evil.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   But just to look around and wake up to that,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.540]   especially in a leadership position.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.280]   Yeah, was he able to see that?
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.120]   - In some ways, yes.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.940]   In some ways, no.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.040]   I mean, the premise of your question is really important
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.760]   that to us, it's obvious that slavery is a horror,
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.200]   but to those who had grown up with it,
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.240]   who had grown up seeing that,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.160]   it was hard to imagine a different world.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.720]   So you're right.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.860]   Lincoln's imagination like everyone else's
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.760]   was limited by his time.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.320]   I don't think Lincoln imagined a world of equality
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.600]   between the races,
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.440]   but he had come to see that slavery was horrible.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.560]   And historians have differed in how he came to this.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.540]   Part of it is that he had a father
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.640]   who treated him like a slave.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.520]   And you can see in his early correspondence
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.080]   how much he hates that his father,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.840]   who was a struggling farmer,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.680]   was basically trying to control Lincoln's life.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.560]   And he came to understand personally,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   I think how horrible it is to have someone else
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.680]   tell you what you should do with your labor,
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.760]   not giving you your own choices.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.320]   But Lincoln was also a pragmatist.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.120]   This is what made him a great politician.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.920]   He wanted to work through institutions,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.680]   not to burn them down.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   And he famously said that if he could preserve the union
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.100]   and stop the spread of slavery
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.320]   by allowing slavery to stay in the South, he would.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   If he could do it by eliminating slavery in the South,
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.160]   he would.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.040]   If he could do it by buying the slaves
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.200]   and sending them somewhere else, he would.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.880]   His main goal, what he ran on,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.540]   was that the new territories West of Illinois,
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.140]   that they would be areas for free, poor,
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.500]   white men like him, not slavery.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.740]   - What do you learn about human nature,
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.940]   if we step back and look at the big picture of it,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.540]   that slavery has been a part of human civilization
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.880]   for thousands of years?
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.520]   That this American slavery is not a new phenomenon?
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.740]   - I think history teaches us a very pessimistic
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.240]   and a very optimistic lesson.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.540]   The pessimistic lesson is that human beings
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.580]   are capable of doing enormous harm and brutality
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.620]   to their fellow man and woman.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.460]   And we see that with genocide in our world today.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.380]   That human beings are capable with the right stimuli,
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.140]   the right incentives of enslaving others.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.160]   I mean, genocide is in the same category, right?
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.820]   The optimistic side is that human beings
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.420]   are also capable with proper leadership and governance
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.680]   of resisting those urges,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.740]   of putting those energies into productive uses
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.780]   for other people.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.380]   But I don't think that comes naturally.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.220]   I think that's where leadership and institutions matter.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.300]   But leadership and institutions can tame us.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.460]   We can tame, we can civilize ourselves.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.280]   You know, for a long time,
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.180]   we stopped using that verb, to civilize.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.900]   I believe in civilization.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.940]   I believe there's a civilizing role.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.340]   Lincoln spoke of that, right?
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.340]   So did Franklin Roosevelt,
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.660]   the civilizing role that government plays.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.360]   Education is only a part of that.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.160]   It's creating laws, minimal laws,
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.540]   but laws nonetheless, that incentivize and penalize us
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.380]   for going to the dark side.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.580]   But if we allow that to happen,
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.140]   or we have leaders who encourage us to go to the dark side,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.440]   we can very quickly go down a deep, dark tunnel.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.420]   - See, I believe that most people want to do good.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.540]   And the power of institutions, if done well,
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.420]   they encourage and protect you if you want to do good.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.440]   So if you're just in the jungle,
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.340]   from a game theoretic perspective,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.760]   you get punished for doing good.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.240]   So being extremely self-centered and greedy
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.440]   and even violent and manipulative
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.620]   can have, from a game theory perspective, benefits.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.160]   But I don't think that's what most humans want.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.580]   Institutions allow you to do what you actually want,
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.560]   which is to do good for the world, do good for others,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.240]   and actually in so doing, do good for yourself.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.800]   Institutions protect that natural human instinct, I think.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.280]   - And what you just articulated,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.060]   which I think the historical record is very strong on,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.200]   is the classic liberal position.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.580]   That's what liberalism means in a 19th century sense, right?
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.260]   That you believe in civilizing human beings
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.860]   through institutions that begins with education.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.380]   Kindergarten is an institution.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.120]   Laws.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   And just basic habits that are enforced by society.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.360]   How do you think people thought about the idea,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.280]   how did they square the idea of all men are created equal,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.560]   those very powerful words at the founding of this nation?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.180]   How did they square that with slavery?
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.040]   - For many Americans, saying all men were created equal
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.200]   required slavery because it meant that
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.880]   the equality of white people was dependent upon
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.480]   others doing the work for us.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.500]   In the way some people view animal labor today.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.560]   And maybe in 50 years, we'll see that as a contradiction.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.120]   But the notion among many Americans in the 17th,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.620]   18th century, and this would also be true
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.440]   for those in other societies, was that
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   equality for white men meant that you had access
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.080]   to the labor of others that would allow you
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.540]   to equalize other differences.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.200]   So you could produce enough food so your family
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.560]   could live equally well nourished as other families
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.660]   because you had slaves on the land doing the farming for you.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.720]   This is Thomas Jefferson's world.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.960]   - So it's like animal farm, all animals are equal,
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.520]   but some are more equal than others.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.360]   - That's right.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.800]   And I think that's still the way people view things.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.640]   - Yeah.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.480]   - Right?
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.760]   - I don't know if that's a liberal position
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.660]   or it's just a human position that all humans
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.660]   have equal value, just on the basic level of humanity.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.120]   - But do we really believe that?
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   - We want to, I don't know if our society
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.680]   really believes that yet.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.600]   - And I don't know exactly, I mean,
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.840]   it's super complicated, of course,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.080]   when you realize the amount of suffering
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.840]   that's going on in the world where there's children
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.800]   dying from starvation in Africa,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.860]   and to say that all humans are equal,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.520]   well, a few dollars can save their life.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.700]   And instead we buy a Starbucks coffee
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.440]   and are willing to pay 10, 50, $100,000
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.040]   to save a child, our child, like somebody from our family,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   and don't want to spend $2 to save a child over in Africa.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   - Right.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.320]   - So there's, and I think Sam Harris or others
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.120]   have talked about, well, I don't want to live in a world
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.920]   where we'd rather send $2 to Africa.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.360]   There's something deeply human about saving those
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.560]   that are really close to you, the ones we love.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.920]   So that hypocrisy that seems to go at tension
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.440]   with the basic ethics of alleviating suffering in the world,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.100]   that's also really human.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:23.740]   That's also part of this ideal of all men are created equal.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.000]   It's a complicated, messy world, ethically.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.800]   - It is, but I mean, I think,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.080]   at least the way I think about it is,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.020]   so what are the things, even within our own society,
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.540]   where we choose to do something with our resources
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.320]   that actually doesn't help the lives of many people?
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.700]   So we invest in all kinds of things that are often,
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.460]   because someone is lobbying for them.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.860]   This happens on both sides of the aisle.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.980]   This is not a political statement, right?
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.620]   Rather than saying, you know, if we invested
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.520]   a little more of our money, really a little more,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.220]   we can make sure every child in this country
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.320]   had decent healthcare.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   We can make sure every child in this country
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.140]   had what they needed to start life healthy.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.460]   And that would not require us to sacrifice a lot,
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.100]   but it would require us to sacrifice a few things.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.620]   - Yeah, there's a balance there.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.740]   And I also noticed the passive-aggressive statement
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.060]   you're making about how I'm spending my money.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.900]   (Lex laughing)
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.720]   - It'll be two.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.260]   - Spending it a little more wisely.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.100]   (Lex laughing)
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   - You know, I like to eat nice meals at nice restaurants,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.060]   so I'm as guilty of this as you are.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.960]   - I got a couch, and that couch serves no purpose.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.800]   - It looks nice, though.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.620]   No, it's a nice-looking couch.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.460]   - It does, thank you, I appreciate that.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.300]   - It's a nice-looking couch.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.120]   It's actually very clean.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.780]   - I got it for occasional Instagram photos
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.100]   to look like an adult.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.380]   - Okay.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.980]   - 'Cause everything else in my life is a giant mess.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.020]   What role did the ideas that the founding documents
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.540]   of this country play in this war,
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.940]   the war between the Union and the Confederate States,
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.980]   and the founding ideas that were supposed to be unifying
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.820]   to this country?
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.620]   Is there interesting tensions there?
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.900]   - Well, there were certainly tensions
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.500]   because built into the founding documents, of course,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.700]   is slavery and inequality and women's exclusion
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.100]   from voting and things of that sort.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.980]   But the real brilliance of Abraham Lincoln
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   is to build on the brilliance of the founders
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.820]   and turn the Union position into the defense
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.380]   of the core ideas of the country.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.260]   So the Confederacy is defending one idea,
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.300]   the idea of slavery.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.780]   Lincoln takes the basket of all the deeper ideas
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.020]   and puts them together.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.980]   Three things the war is about for Lincoln,
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.380]   and this is why his speeches still resonate with us today.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.780]   You know, every time I'm in Washington,
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.660]   I go to the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.780]   It's the best memorial, best monument,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.500]   I think, in the world, actually.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.180]   And there are always people there
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.540]   reading the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.900]   Lincoln had two years of education,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.500]   yet he found the words to describe
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.100]   what our country was about better than anyone.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.700]   And it's because he went back to these founding values,
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.100]   three values, we already talked about one, freedom.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.700]   That, and freedom is actually complex, but it's also simple.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.580]   The simple Lincoln definition
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.060]   is that freedom is the right of each person
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.060]   to work for himself or herself,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.940]   which is to say, it doesn't mean you own your own company,
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.260]   but it means you control your labor.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.740]   And no one can tell you you have to work for a certain wage.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.860]   You might not have a job, but you decide, you decide, right?
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.020]   You can see where that comes from his own background
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.020]   as a poor man, right?
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.940]   So freedom is the control of your own labor.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.660]   Second, democracy, government of the people,
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.220]   by the people, for the people.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.460]   The government is to serve the people,
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.900]   it's to come from the people.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.260]   And then the third point,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.660]   justice and helping all human beings.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.500]   He, at the end of his life, as the civil war is ending,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.300]   he never declares that the South should be punished.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.940]   His argument is that we shouldn't apologize
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.500]   for their misdeeds,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.380]   but that all should be part of this future.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.740]   He's not arguing for consensus,
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.580]   he's arguing for a society
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.460]   where everyone has a stake going forward.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.460]   So justice, democracy, freedom, those are the gifts.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.220]   I talked about the flaws in our system,
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.380]   those are the virtues in our system
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.620]   that our founders coming out of the enlightenment planted
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.140]   and Lincoln carries them forward.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.300]   He gives us the 2.0 version of them.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.700]   - So a few tangent questions about each of those.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.020]   So one on democracy,
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.260]   people often bring up the United States is not a democracy,
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.660]   it's a republic, that it's representative.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.140]   Is there some interesting tensions there in terminology
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.980]   or is, yeah, can you maybe kind of expand
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.300]   on the different versions of democracy,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.580]   so the philosophy of democracy,
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.820]   but also the practical implementations of it?
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.700]   - Sure, the founders intended for us to be a democracy.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.620]   This argument that they wanted us to be a republic
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.100]   instead of a democracy is one of these made up myths.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.900]   They believed that fundamentally what they were creating
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.220]   was a society, very few of which had existed before,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.860]   a society where the government would be of the people,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.380]   by the people, for the people, that's what they expected.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.220]   That's what it meant.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.820]   So the legitimacy of our government was not gonna be
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.900]   that the person in charge was of royal blood,
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.300]   that's the way the Europeans did it,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.700]   or that the person in charge had killed enough people,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.380]   a la Genghis Khan, or that the person in charge
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.100]   was serving a particular class.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.420]   It was that the person in charge,
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.420]   the institutions were to serve the people.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.220]   They adopted Republican tools to get there
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.580]   because they were fearful appropriately
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.500]   of simply throwing every issue up to the masses.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.740]   Democracy is not mob rule.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.660]   Democracy is where you create procedures
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.660]   to assess the public will and to act in ways
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.980]   that serve the public without harming other elements
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.020]   of the public that are not in the majority.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.660]   That's why we have a constitution and a bill of rights.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.020]   And for their time, the founders did not believe
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.100]   that women should be part of this discussion,
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.580]   that they were not capable.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.380]   They were wrong about that in their time,
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.220]   that's how they thought.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.820]   We've of course changed that.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.060]   They believed you had to have property to have a stake.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.460]   We don't believe that anymore.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.380]   So we can argue over the details,
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   and those 50 years from now will criticize us, right,
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.380]   for the way we think about these things.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.340]   But it was fundamentally about,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.900]   this is the radicalism of the American experiment,
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.020]   that government should serve the people, all people.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.060]   - So democracy means of the people,
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.580]   by the people, for the people,
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.380]   and then it doesn't actually give any details
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.340]   of how you implement that,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.340]   'cause you could implement all kinds of ways.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.780]   - And I think what we've learned as historians,
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.700]   I think what the founders knew,
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.020]   'cause they were very well-read
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.660]   in the history of Rome and Greece,
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.340]   was that democracy will always have unique characteristics
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.780]   for the culture that it's in.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.180]   If coming out of the war against Russia,
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.540]   Ukraine is able to build a better democracy
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   than it had before,
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.460]   it's never gonna look like the United States.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.260]   I'm not saying it's gonna be worse or better.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.620]   A culture matters.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.100]   The particular history of societies matters.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.420]   Japan is a vibrant democracy.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.940]   I've been there many times.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.460]   It does not look at all like the American democracy.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.740]   So democracy is a set of values.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.540]   The implementation of those values
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.740]   is a set of practical institutional decisions
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.180]   one makes based in one's cultural position.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.580]   - So just the one on that topic,
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.660]   is there, if you do representative,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.820]   you said like, you know, democracy should not,
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   one failure mode is mob rule.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.420]   So it should not descend into that.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.100]   Not every issue should be up to everybody.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.940]   - Correct.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.460]   - Okay, so you have representation,
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.820]   but, you know,
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:38.620]   Stalin similarly felt that he could represent
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.300]   the interests of the public.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.740]   He was also helping represent the interests of the public.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.260]   So that's a failure mode too.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.260]   If the people representing the public
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.060]   become more and more powerful,
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.820]   they start becoming detached
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.940]   from actually being able to represent
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.740]   or having just a basic human sense of what the public wants.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.180]   - I think being of the people, by the people, for the people
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.100]   means you are in some way accountable to the people.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.020]   And the problem with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.220]   this was already evident before Stalin came into power,
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.300]   is the same problem the Communist Party of China has today,
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.140]   which is that you have leadership that's non-accountable.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.460]   - Well, let me go then to one of the other
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.940]   three principles of freedom,
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.340]   because one of the ways to keep government accountable
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.300]   is the freedom of the press.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.500]   So there's the internet, and on the internet,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.460]   there's social networks, and one of them's called Twitter.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.980]   I think you have an account there, people should follow you.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.340]   And, you know, recently people have been
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.540]   throwing around recently, for a while,
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.340]   the words of freedom of speech.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.140]   Just out of curiosity, for a tangent upon a tangent,
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.620]   what do you think of freedom of speech?
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.660]   As it is today, and as it was at that time
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.180]   during the Civil War, after the Civil War,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.340]   and throughout the history of America?
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.500]   - So freedom of speech has always been
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.340]   one of the core tenets of American democracy,
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.700]   and I'm near absolutist on it,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.620]   because I think that people should have the right to speak.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.940]   What makes our democracy function
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.020]   is that there is always room for, quite frankly,
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.260]   people like you and me, who like to disagree,
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.180]   and have reasons to disagree.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.100]   So I am against almost all forms of censorship.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.500]   The only time I believe in censorship
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.620]   is if somehow an individual or a newspaper
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.420]   has stolen the Ukrainian plans
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.020]   for their next military movements in the next week.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.780]   You should not be able to publish that right now,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.820]   maybe after they act.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.340]   But criticism, opinion, interpretation,
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.060]   should be wide open.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.660]   Now, that doesn't mean, though,
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.580]   that you have the right to come to my classroom
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.380]   and start shouting and saying whatever you want.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.100]   You have the right on the street corner to do that,
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.020]   but my classroom is a classroom for my students
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.300]   with a particular purpose.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.900]   - Sorry about that from last week.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.740]   I'll never do it again.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.100]   (laughing)
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   Really sorry.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:04.940]   - It's okay.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.780]   - Never happened.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.180]   I get drunk, and I get...
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.020]   To the people who don't know,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.700]   you're a professor at UT Austin, and it's nearby,
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.380]   so sometimes I get a little drunk and wander in there.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.220]   I apologize. - You're not the only one.
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.060]   Was that you?
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.880]   I didn't even know it was you.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.720]   - I'm sorry.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.540]   (laughing)
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.380]   Okay.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.820]   - So the point is that free speech
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.260]   is not licensed to invade someone else's space,
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.220]   and I also believe in private enterprise.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   So I think that if I owned a social media network, I don't.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:36.100]   It would be up to me to decide
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.500]   who gets to speak on that network and who doesn't,
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.020]   and then people could decide not to use it
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.300]   if they don't wanna use it.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.380]   But there's a...
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.140]   So yes, that's one of the founding principles.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.360]   So oftentimes when you talk about censorship,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.580]   that's government censorship.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.860]   So a social media, if you run a social media company,
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.580]   you should be able to decide from a technical perspective
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.060]   of what freedom of speech means.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.260]   But there's some deeper ethical, philosophical sense of
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.280]   how do you create a world where every voice is heard
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.000]   of the people, by the people, for the people?
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.820]   That's not a...
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.940]   That's a complicated technical problem
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.580]   when you have a public square.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.460]   How do you have a productive conversation
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.220]   where critics aren't silenced, but at the same time,
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.700]   whoever has the bigger megaphone
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.040]   is not gonna crowd out everybody else?
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.500]   - So I think it's very important to create rules of the game
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.020]   that'll give everyone a chance to get started
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.520]   and that allow for guideposts to be created
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.660]   from the will of the community, which is to say
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.460]   that we as a community can say,
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.540]   we can't stop people from speaking,
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.260]   but we as a community can say that in certain forms,
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.260]   we're gonna create certain rules
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.140]   for who gets to speak and who doesn't, under what terms,
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.780]   but they can still have somewhere else to go.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.980]   So I believe in opening space for everyone,
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.600]   but creating certain spaces within those spaces
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.480]   that are designed for certain purposes.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.060]   That's what a school does.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.860]   So I will not bring someone to speak to my students
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.780]   who is unqualified.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.260]   It's not a political judgment.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.820]   The rules at a university,
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.260]   or where an educational institution,
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.020]   you need to have the educational credentials
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.860]   to come speak about artificial intelligence.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.900]   I'm not gonna bring some bum off the street to do that.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.580]   We have certain rules, but that bum on the street
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.140]   can still, in his own space or her own space,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.620]   can still say what he or she wants to say
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.100]   about artificial intelligence.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.620]   This is how newspapers work.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.060]   When I write for the New York Times,
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.540]   they have an editorial team.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.980]   The editorial team makes certain decisions.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:37.100]   They check facts, and there are certain points of view.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.100]   They don't allow anti-Semitic comments.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.220]   You're not gonna be able to publish an anti-Semitic screed,
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.540]   whether you think it's true or not true
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.380]   in the New York Times,
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.100]   but that doesn't prevent you from finding somewhere else.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.220]   So we allow entities to create certain rules of the game.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.380]   We make transparent what those rules are.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.480]   And then we, as citizens,
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.020]   know where to go to get our information.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.620]   What's been a problem the last few decades, I think,
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.180]   is it hasn't been clear
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.820]   what the rules are in different places,
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.220]   and what are the legitimate places to get information,
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.060]   and what are not.
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.220]   - Yeah, the transparency seems to be very critical there.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.740]   Even for the New York Times,
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.780]   I think there's a lot of skepticism
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.660]   about which way the editorial processes lean.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.940]   I mean, there's a public perception that it's,
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.380]   especially for opinions,
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.520]   it's going to be very left-leaning in the New York Times.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.220]   And without transparency
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.600]   about what the process is like,
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.340]   about the people involved,
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.380]   all you do, like conspiracy theories
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.900]   and the general public opinion about that
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.380]   is going to go wild.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.100]   And I think that's okay for the New York Times.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.420]   People can, in a collective way, figure stuff out.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.420]   Like they can say, okay, New York Times,
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.780]   73% of the time is going to lean left in their head.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.620]   They have like a loose estimation or whatever.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.740]   But for a platform like Twitter,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.020]   it seems like it's more complicated.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.460]   Of course, there should be rules of the game,
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.860]   but I think there's, maybe I want to say a responsibility
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.100]   to also create incentives
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   for people to do high effort empathetic debate
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.700]   versus throwing poop at each other.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.100]   - Yeah, I think those are two slightly different things,
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.420]   so I agree.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.860]   I think that my view is that the failure of Facebook
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.460]   and Twitter and others in recent years
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.100]   has been that they have been completely untransparent
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.340]   about their rules.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:29.980]   So what I would think would advance us
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.540]   is if they had a set of rules that were clear,
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.640]   that were consistently followed,
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.780]   and we understood what they were,
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.900]   that would also tell us as consumers
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.260]   what the biases are, how to understand what's going on.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.360]   It seems, if I might say,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.100]   that since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter,
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.860]   it's been arbitrary in who's thrown off
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.500]   and who's not thrown off.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.820]   And that's a real problem.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.220]   Arbitrariness is in some ways the opposite of democracy.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:57.860]   - But there's also a hidden arbitrariness
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.860]   in interpretation of the rules.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.800]   So for example, what comment incites violence?
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.880]   That's really, really difficult to figure out to me.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.220]   There's a gray area.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.860]   Obviously, there's very clear versions of that,
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.040]   but if I know anything about people
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.840]   that try to incite violence,
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.720]   they're usually not coming out and clearly saying it.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.320]   They're usually kinda dog-whistling it.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.640]   And same with racism and anti-Semitism, all of that.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.960]   It's usually dog whistles.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.280]   And they usually have fun playing with the rules,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.360]   playing around the rules.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.840]   So it's a gray area.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.320]   Same with during COVID, misinformation.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.000]   What's misinformation, right?
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.840]   - I agree.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   And some of these are age-old problems.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.380]   Our legal system, common law,
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.000]   has been struggling with what is incitement to violence
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.100]   since the first Supreme Court decisions
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.420]   in the 18th century, right?
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.180]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.460]   But I will say this.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.340]   There are certain things
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.260]   that are clearly incitement to violence.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.960]   I'll give you very clear examples.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.060]   I'll just make it personal, right?
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.620]   My wife is an elected official here in Austin.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.820]   There have been people who have put things up on Twitter
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.520]   calling for her to be hanged
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.440]   or calling for her to be attacked.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.880]   That's incitement to violence.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.260]   When you specifically call for violence against someone,
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.420]   I agree, there's a lot of other stuff
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.500]   where it's a gray area,
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.140]   but we could start if we're applying these rules
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.360]   by getting that material off of these sites.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.020]   - So some of that is a problem of scale too,
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.260]   but the gray area is still a forever problem
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.940]   that we may never be able to solve.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.940]   And maybe the tension within the gray area
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.100]   is the very process of democracy.
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.100]   But saying like, "We need to take our country back."
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.460]   Is that incitement to violence?
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.300]   - I don't think that.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.660]   I think we need to take our country back, just that, no.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.220]   - But then, you know- - 'Cause I might say that.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.380]   I might say we need to take our-
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.900]   - I say that all the time.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.980]   Again, I walk around drunk,
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.860]   just screaming at everybody.
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.900]   - I thought you wanted us to take you back.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.140]   - Exactly.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:50.980]   I was very confused.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.620]   My messaging needs to work.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.920]   - But let's go to the January 6th example, right?
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   To say, "Hang Mike Pence," that's incitement to violence.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   - Yeah.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   - To say, "Go get Nancy," that's incitement to violence.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.360]   - Yeah, yeah, it's very clear.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.800]   Again, I don't think that's the big problem.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.520]   The big problem is the gray area.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.720]   But yeah, and the other problem is just how to get,
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.440]   how to technically find the large scale of comments
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.000]   and posts and so on that are doing this kind of clear-
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.080]   - Yeah, but it's something for you to solve.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.920]   You're the AI guy. - I understand, I understand.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.640]   - I mean, don't ask me those questions.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.600]   - Well, I have to say some of that is motivation,
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.240]   some of that is vision, and some of that is execution.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.180]   So for example, just to go out briefly on a dark topic,
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.640]   something I've recently became aware of is,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.700]   Facebook and Twitter and so on,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.800]   people post violence on there,
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.940]   like literal, like videos of violence, child porn,
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.440]   some of the darkest things in this world.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.760]   And to find them at scale is a difficult problem.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.120]   And to act on it aggressively is a difficult problem.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   But I think part of this motivation,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.000]   like saying, "This is a big problem.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.080]   We need to take this on.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.200]   We need to find all the darkest aspects of human nature
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.340]   that rise and appear on our platform and remove them
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:14.800]   so that we can create a place for humanity to flourish
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.120]   through the process of conversation."
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.780]   But it's just hard, it's just really hard.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.700]   When you look at millions of posts,
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   trillions of interactions, it's wild,
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.580]   what's like the amount of data.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.580]   - But where we are now with social media
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.060]   seemed wild and impossible five years ago, right?
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.900]   - Yes.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.620]   - I actually, what frustrates me is I think there are people
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.660]   who have politicized this issue in unnecessary ways.
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.300]   Everyone, regardless of their politics,
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.060]   should support what you just said.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:46.600]   Investing our money, maybe grants from the federal government
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.300]   in AI skilled people like you figuring out ways
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.620]   to get violent videos off of there.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.880]   That shouldn't be political.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.020]   - Well, some of that also requires being transparent
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.580]   from a social media company perspective
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.580]   and transparent in a way that really resists being political.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.220]   To be able to be transparent about your fight
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:11.140]   against these evils while still not succumbing
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.700]   to the sort of the political narratives of it.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.040]   That's tricky, but you have to do that kind of,
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.360]   and walk calmly through the fire.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.160]   So that's what Twitter feels like if you're being political.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.760]   It's like a firing squad from every side.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.520]   As a leader, you have to kind of walk calmly.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.400]   - And that is where we need a new generation
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.480]   of people who will have diverse politics,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.040]   but will stand up against that, right?
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.360]   I mean, that's the lesson from after the civil war
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.400]   is where progress is made.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.720]   The war doesn't solve problems of hate.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.040]   Where progress is made is where you have local leaders
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.500]   and others who stand up and say, we can differ,
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.900]   but we're gonna stop calling people
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.420]   from certain backgrounds monkeys,
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.780]   which was a common thing to do at that time.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.640]   Jews are still called monkeys in certain places, right?
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.880]   People have to stand up while still maintaining
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.280]   their political differences.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.260]   - Several hundred thousand people died.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.540]   What made this war such a deadly war?
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.300]   - It's extraordinary how many people died,
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.940]   more than half a million.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:13.260]   And this was without a single automatic rifle,
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.700]   without a single bomb.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.660]   It was mostly in hand to hand combat,
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.120]   which is to say that these 600,000 or so people who died,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.700]   they died where the person who killed them
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.700]   was standing within a few feet of them.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.900]   And that's really hard.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.860]   Most of the killing that happens in wars today
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.420]   is actually from a distance.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.140]   It's by a drone, it's by a bomb, it's by a rocket,
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.820]   or by an automatic weapon.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.100]   And just to make this even more focused,
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.220]   to this day, the deadliest day in American history
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.780]   was during the Civil War.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.460]   September, 1862 at Antietam,
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:51.460]   more than 22,000 Americans killed one another hand to hand.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.540]   There hasn't been a day that deadly in American history
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.420]   since then, that's amazing considering
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.380]   the technological changes.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.700]   - What was in the mind of those soldiers on each side?
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.820]   Was there conviction for ideas?
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.740]   Did they hate the other side?
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.320]   - I think actually they were fighting out of fear.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.620]   What we know from reading their letters,
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.820]   what we know from the accounts,
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:16.580]   is that yes, there are ideas that are promoted to them
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.900]   to get them to the battlefield,
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.780]   they believe in what they're doing,
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.340]   but here it's the same as World War I,
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.180]   and I think the Civil War and World War I
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.020]   are very similar as wars.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.260]   You are in these horrible conditions,
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.100]   you're attacked, and you have the chance
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:33.420]   to either kill the other side and live, or die.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.260]   And you fight to live,
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.340]   and you fight to save the people next to you.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.060]   What is true about war,
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.100]   what is both good and dangerous about it,
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.580]   is you form an almost unparalleled bond
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:46.660]   with those on your side.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.580]   This is the men under arms scenario, right?
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.700]   And that's where the killing goes,
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.860]   and it's a civil war, which means
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.660]   sometimes it's brother against brother, quite literally.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:00.920]   And what it teaches us is how human beings
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.740]   can be put into fighting and will commit enormous damage.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.700]   And that's why this happens, it goes on for four years.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.660]   - In just the extensive research you've done
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.580]   on this war for this book,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.860]   what are some of the worst and some of the best aspects
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.580]   of human nature that you found?
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.180]   Like you said, brother against brother,
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.080]   that's pretty powerful.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.140]   - They're both, right?
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.620]   So the level of violence that human beings are capable of,
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.820]   how long they're able to sustain it.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.120]   The South should not have,
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.100]   the Confederacy should not have lasted in this war
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.440]   as long as it did.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   By the end, I mean, they're starving and they keep fighting.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.680]   So the resilience in war of societies
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.000]   and the power of hate to move people.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   What are the bright sides?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.640]   You see in Lincoln and Grant,
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.200]   who I talk about a lot in the book as well, Ulysses Grant,
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.520]   you see the ability of empathetic figures
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.560]   to still rise above this in spite of all the horror.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.120]   Lincoln went to visit more soldiers in war
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.400]   than any president ever has.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.520]   Often at personal peril 'cause he was close to the lines
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.040]   and he connected, it wasn't propaganda.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.320]   There weren't always reporters following him.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.200]   He was able to build empathy in this context.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.560]   And I think, as I said, war is horrible as it is,
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.080]   often gives opportunities to certain groups.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.200]   So African-Americans, former slaves
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.040]   are able to prove themselves as citizens.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.600]   Jews did this an enormous number in World War II.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Henry Kissinger, who I wrote about before,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.920]   he really only gets recognized as an American.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.480]   He's a German Jewish immigrant.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.560]   He's seen as an American
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.000]   because of his service in World War II.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.800]   So the bright side of this is that often in the case of war,
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.400]   on your own side,
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.120]   you will let go of some of your prejudices.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.000]   Ulysses Grant has a total transformation.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.440]   He goes into the Civil War, an anti-Semite and a racist.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.800]   He comes out with actually very enlightened views
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.280]   'cause he sees what Jewish soldiers
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.160]   and what African-American soldiers did.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.680]   - What's Ulysses Grant's story?
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.280]   What do you learn from him?
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.840]   Was he a hero or a villain of this war?
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.200]   - I think he's a hero,
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.680]   though he's a flawed hero, as all heroes are.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.760]   He's a man from Ohio and Illinois
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.560]   who was really a failed businessman time and again,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.880]   and had an ability to command people in war.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.400]   Where did this come from?
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.440]   He was a clear communicator and an empathetic figure.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.160]   He tended to drink too much,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.840]   but he was the kind of person people wanted to follow.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   They trusted him.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.760]   And so in battle, that became very important.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.120]   And the second thing is he did his homework.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.880]   He had a sense of the terrain.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.440]   He had a sense of the environment he was operating in,
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.120]   and he was ruthless in pursuing what he had studied.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.820]   So he turns out at battles like Vicksburg and elsewhere
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.780]   to actually undertake some pretty revolutionary maneuvers.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.420]   And then he figures out that the advantage now
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.860]   is on his side in numbers,
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.180]   and he just pounds Lee, pounds him to death.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.620]   Similar to what the United States does
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.500]   at the end of World War II with Germany and Japan.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.260]   He comes out of the war, Grant does.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.700]   He's a believer in union.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:20.220]   He wants to protect former slaves and other groups,
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.420]   and he tries to use the military for that purpose.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.500]   He's limited.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.540]   And then as president, he tries to do that as well.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.820]   Right now, we still use many of the laws
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.620]   that were passed during Grant's presidency
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.980]   to prosecute insurrectionists.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.260]   So the 900 or so people who have been prosecuted
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.180]   for breaking into the Capitol
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.360]   and attacking police on January 6th, those insurrectionists,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.380]   they've been prosecuted
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.900]   under the 1871 Anti-Klu Klux Klan law.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.700]   So that's a big accomplishment by Grant,
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.560]   and we still benefit from it.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.580]   The problem is Grant was not a great politician.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:55.260]   Unlike Lincoln, he didn't give good speeches.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.300]   He wasn't a persuasive figure in a political space.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.460]   And so he had trouble building support
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.860]   for what he was doing, even though he was trying to do
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.220]   what in the end, I think, were the right things.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.940]   - What was the role of the KKK at that time?
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.260]   - So the Klu Klux Klan is formed
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.460]   at the end of the Civil War by Confederate veterans,
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.340]   first in Tennessee, in Pulaski, Tennessee,
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.420]   and then it spreads elsewhere.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.280]   And there are other groups that are similar,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.240]   the Red Shirts and various others.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.240]   These are veterans of the Confederate Army who come home
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.180]   and are committed to continuing the war.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.780]   They are gonna use their power at home and their weapons
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.360]   to intimidate and if necessary, kill people
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.420]   who challenge their authority, not just African-Americans,
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.380]   Jews, Catholics, various others.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.740]   They are going to basically protect the continued rule
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:47.060]   of the same families who owned the slaves before
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:51.800]   in post-slavery Tennessee and post-slavery South Carolina.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.320]   And when we get to voting, they're often the groups
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.640]   that are preventing people from voting.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.720]   The white sheets and the ritual around that
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   was all an effort to provide a certain ritualistic
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.820]   legitimacy and hide identity,
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.640]   though everyone knew who they were.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.800]   - Oh, so that whole brand, that whole practice
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.400]   was there from the very beginning.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.540]   Have you studied the KKK's history a little bit?
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.080]   - I have and there are a number of other historians
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.540]   who have too, so I've used their research as well.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.540]   - I'm kind of curious, I have to admit that my knowledge
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.140]   of it is very kind of caricature knowledge.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.200]   I'm sure there's interesting stories and threads
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.660]   because I think there's different competing organizations
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.500]   or something like that.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.860]   - Of course. - Within the United States.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.780]   And I feel like through that lens, you can tell a story
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.260]   of the United States also of these different groups.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.720]   - They're often business associations.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.460]   I mean, there's a lot of work showing that actually
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.560]   people joined the KKK for the reasons I just laid out,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.260]   but also because it was networking for your business.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.060]   You gained legitimacy in the area that you were in.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.780]   So these were community groups that were formed
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.100]   to help white business people.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.380]   They helped white sheriffs get elected.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.300]   What we have to understand today is when we're debating
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.940]   policing, this history matters enormously, right?
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.460]   I have nothing against police.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.540]   My cousin, one of my closest relatives just retired
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.660]   from 25 years in the New York Police Department.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.020]   Thank God he survived.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.880]   I have deep respect, he's one of the best public servants
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.960]   I know.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.080]   But what we also have to recognize as we respect
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.500]   police officers is that for many communities in our country,
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:24.160]   they know this history and the KKK in the 1870s
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.440]   and in the 1930s, you look at any KKK organization
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.660]   as I have in my research and you find the police chiefs
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.940]   are the KKK members, the local police officers,
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:37.380]   local judges, because it was how you became police chief.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.620]   - So these groups infiltrated some of the main institutions
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.180]   in our nation.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.120]   - I don't even think they infiltrated.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.160]   I think they were part of those institutions.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.260]   - The deeper question today in the 21st century is one,
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.540]   how much of that is still there and how much of the history
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.940]   of that reverberates through the institutions?
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.060]   - And I'm making the latter point that it's not there
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.740]   that much now, but people remember it.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.260]   - Well, and some people would even say it's not there
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.380]   at all, that there is not institutional racism
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.380]   in policing, but if that's the case,
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.580]   then you can also say that if there is not direct
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.580]   institutional racism there, what is it?
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.300]   The echoes of history still have effects.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.380]   - Of course, and that's really important
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.760]   and that we have to take that seriously.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.180]   That's not an excuse for people then saying nasty things
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.340]   about the police, but it is what we have to recognize.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.820]   Look, I'm Jewish and there are certain elements
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.660]   of Russian behavior today I see in Ukraine
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.300]   that reverberate with the history of how my grandparents
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.880]   dealt with pogroms in Russia, right?
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.940]   Even though what Putin is doing in Ukraine
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.300]   might not technically be a pogrom,
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.940]   that history matters in how I view these issues
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.500]   and that's a reality.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   - Yeah, I went to 7-Eleven recently and what did I eat?
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.740]   I ate one of their salads.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.020]   I'm sorry, I love 7-Eleven, I'm sorry.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.620]   I ate one of the salads and got like terrible food poisoning.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.500]   I was suffering for like four days and now I can't,
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.340]   I love 7-Eleven, I love going to 7-Eleven late at night
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.540]   in sweatpants and just I escaped the world.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.540]   I'm listening to an audio book
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.100]   and now every time I pass that salad,
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.940]   for the rest of my life, I would have hate for that salad.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.180]   So history matters, even if the salad is no longer
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.900]   have any bad stuff in it.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.940]   It's probably the lettuce or something, whatever,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.660]   mostly for humor's sake, but I'm also giving
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.660]   a kind of metaphor that history can have an individual
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:43.620]   and a large-scale society effect on human interactions,
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.740]   both the good and the bad.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.820]   If you actually recommend to me offline books on the KKK,
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.140]   that would be really-- - I'd be happy to.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.500]   There were a few mentioned in the footnotes
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.380]   of my book here.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.940]   - And also in part, 'cause I also want to understand
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.380]   the white nationalism, white supremacists,
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.500]   Christian supremacists or Christian nationalism,
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.660]   all those different subgroups in the United States
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.500]   and elsewhere in the world.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.460]   I'm a bit, my mind has been focused
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.220]   on some of the better aspects of human nature
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.060]   that it's nice to also understand
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.460]   some of the darker aspects.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.380]   Let me ask you sort of a personal question for me.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.900]   Do you think it's possible, do you think it's useful
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.380]   to do a podcast conversation with somebody like David Duke
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:31.340]   or somebody, this is somebody that everybody knows,
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.700]   so it's not like you're giving a platform
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   to somebody that's a hidden member of the KKK
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.180]   or like a, it's sort of putting a pretty face
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.500]   on some dark ideas, but everybody knows.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.220]   And so now you're just exploring,
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.980]   you're sitting across the table, maybe not in his case,
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.700]   maybe somebody who's an active KKK member,
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.500]   sitting across from a person that literally hates me, Lex.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.860]   I think that's fascinating to explore that way.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:05.100]   - I think so long as what you are doing
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:09.420]   is not boosting someone, so taking an obscure figure
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.540]   and making that figure now famous,
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.140]   but if it's someone who's already infamous
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.780]   and it helps us to understand them,
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.860]   and so long as your effort is to ask them tough questions,
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.140]   which you do, right?
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.340]   You don't give them all the questions in advance,
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.700]   you don't have limitations on what you can ask,
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:32.380]   so long as it is a real interview, not pablum,
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   then I'm for it.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.500]   What I'm against is a softball interview
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.980]   that allows someone to sound reasonable when they're not.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980]   But the way I've seen you do this,
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.340]   when you've had figures like that,
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.380]   I won't name who I have in mind,
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.700]   but when I've seen that is, I think that's useful
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.060]   because honestly, the historian in me
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.580]   and the citizen in me wants to understand.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:54.900]   My Jewish grandfather always was the first
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.460]   to be against any effort to suppress anti-Semites
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.700]   because his view was he wanted to know who they were
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.980]   and he wanted to know what they thought
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.700]   so he could be prepared.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.920]   - And I also see, perhaps as a historian,
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.820]   you may be able to appreciate this kind of thing,
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.300]   that's probably how you see the world,
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.080]   but there's several ways to see a human being.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.940]   Like Vladimir Putin is an example.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:22.540]   One is a political figure that's currently
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:27.100]   doing actions on the world, geopolitics internally,
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.900]   the politics of Russia, but there's also that human being
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.940]   in a historical context.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.980]   And collecting information about that person
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.500]   in the historical context is also very valuable.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   So you could see interviews with Hitler in '39, '40, '41
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.420]   as being very bad and detrimental
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.580]   to all that is good in the world.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.900]   But at the same time, it's important to understand
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:55.020]   that human mind, how power affects that mind,
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.100]   how power corrupts it, how they see the world.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.580]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.020]   I would be all in favor, and maybe he will,
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.020]   if Vladimir Putin would sit down with you, absolutely.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.420]   I don't think you're boosting someone like that
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.560]   when you ask them tough questions.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.420]   In fact, I think that's what we need to do.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.780]   Those sorts of figures tend to insulate themselves
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.020]   from tough questions.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:17.820]   So just to restate, I am for the Lex Fridman interview
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.100]   of those sorts of figures.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:23.060]   I am not for the puff piece on Fox and Friends
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.260]   where they just come on and they're asked,
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.180]   "Oh, isn't it, tell us what you think of this.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.860]   Tell us what you think of that."
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.260]   - So, but there's a balance there
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.300]   because a lot of people that interview somebody
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:39.180]   like Vladimir Putin, all they do is hard-hitting questions.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.540]   They often demonstrate a lack of knowledge
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.920]   of the perspective of the Russian people and the president.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.500]   There's not an empathy to understanding
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.260]   that this is a popularly elected,
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.640]   you can criticize that notion,
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.120]   but this is still there that represents the beliefs
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.420]   of a large number of people
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.780]   and they have their own life story.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.620]   They see the world,
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.380]   they believe they're doing good for the world.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:03.380]   And I don't, that idea seems to not permeate the questions
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.740]   and the thoughts that people say
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.220]   because they're afraid of being attacked
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.540]   by the people back home, fellow journalists,
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.020]   for not being hard enough.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.860]   - Well, maybe.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.740]   I think that's probably true.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.020]   I think in my experience with interviewers
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.420]   is that a lot of them are really lazy.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.100]   You're not, which is why I like talking to you.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.040]   - Can I just say, okay, this is not you saying it.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.920]   Can I just rant?
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.200]   If you're sitting across from Xi Jinping
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.080]   or from Vladimir Putin, you should be fired
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.760]   if you have not read at least several books on the guy.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.800]   The surprising lack of research
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.440]   that people do leading up to it.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   So you need to be a historian or a biographer.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.600]   You need to be the kind of person
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.520]   that writes biographies or histories
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.440]   before you sit in front of the person.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.880]   Not a low effort journalist.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.760]   And it's so surprising to me
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.440]   that I think they're probably really busy
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.320]   and it's probably not part of the culture
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.720]   of the people that do interviews
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.140]   to do deep, deep investigative.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.720]   You need to be the kind of person that lives that idea.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.480]   See it as a documentary that you work on
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.800]   for three years kind of thing.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.160]   Anyway, of course, some journalists do do that
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.200]   and they do that masterfully
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.880]   and that's the best of journalism.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.920]   - But I think a lot of the times when the questions are,
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.800]   as you said, out of touch with the society
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.840]   that person is leading,
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.920]   it's because the interviewer hasn't taken the time.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.440]   And I understand you can't be an expert on every subject,
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.920]   but you can do what you do.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.600]   You read my book to prepare for this.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.440]   You looked things up.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.560]   You had a sense of the person you're talking to
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.640]   and you put the time in to do that.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.860]   This is what I always tell my students.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.760]   The secret to success in anything
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.080]   is outworking other people.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.040]   Be more prepared.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.920]   What you show is like an iceberg.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.460]   It's the tip of the iceberg, right?
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.000]   Is what people see.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.040]   It's all the work that goes on below the surface.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.800]   - And if you work hard enough, which I aspire to do,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.860]   at the end of the day, just like an animal farm,
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.600]   you'll be like the horse boxer
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.960]   and slaughtered unjustly
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.800]   by those that are much more powerful than you.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.020]   - But you'll be happy when you're slaughtered.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.480]   - You have lived for the right ideal
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.720]   and history will remember you fondly.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.760]   Okay, what about Robert E. Lee?
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.520]   So he's the Confederate general that you mentioned.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.880]   Was he a hero or a villain?
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.720]   - To me, he's a villain.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.720]   Many people treat Robert E. Lee as a hero.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.720]   And one of the points I make in the book
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.200]   is we have to rethink that.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.800]   And it's very important for our society
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.680]   because Robert E. Lee pops up all over our society,
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.960]   names of schools, names of streets.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.880]   And he also embeds and justifies certain behaviors
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.240]   that I think are really bad.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.640]   Lee was a tremendous general.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.660]   He had the weaker side and he managed to use maneuver,
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.480]   secrecy and circumstance to give himself so many advantages
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.520]   and win so many battles he should have lost.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.280]   So in terms of the technical generalship,
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.320]   he's a great general.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.280]   But Lee at the end of the war
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.960]   never wants to really acknowledge defeat.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.040]   What he acknowledges at Appomattox
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.020]   is that his soldiers will have to leave the battlefield
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.400]   because they have not won on the battlefield.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.880]   But he refuses to do what Grant asks him,
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.160]   which is to help sell his side
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.160]   on the fact that we're going into a post-war moment
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.720]   where they don't have to see themselves as losers,
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.960]   but they have to get on board with change.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.760]   Real leadership is convincing people who follow you
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.400]   that they have to change when they don't want to change.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.280]   Lee refuses to do that.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.960]   He says to Grant, I quote this in the book,
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.760]   he says to Grant at Appomattox,
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.160]   if you want to change the South,
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.560]   you have to run your army over the South three or four times.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.760]   He's not gonna do anything.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.120]   He's not gonna help.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.720]   And he becomes a figure who people rally around
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.220]   in the rest of his life and even after he dies.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:47.220]   So it is as if at the end of World War II,
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:50.280]   Hitler had been allowed to just retire
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.800]   and he didn't go back into politics,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.480]   but yet he was there and he continued to have meetings
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.880]   with former Nazis and people would rally around the idea
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.200]   of bringing back or going back to Hitler's ideas.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.060]   Think of how harmful that would be.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.840]   Lee played that kind of role after the war.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.880]   And I think it's one of the problems we have now.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.000]   I don't think we should continue to revere him
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.760]   because it justifies too much
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.520]   of what the Confederates stood for.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.240]   - And that's the difference that you highlight
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.960]   between World War II and the Civil War
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.520]   that in the case of Hitler,
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.200]   there was an end to that war.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.320]   There's a very distinctive, clear end to that war.
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.960]   And you also make the case that World War II
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.920]   is not a good example, not a good model of a war
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.800]   to help us analyze history.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.120]   - It's given Americans the wrong idea of what war is
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.520]   because World War II ends as most wars don't end.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.120]   World War II ends with the complete defeat
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.560]   of the German army and the German society
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.200]   and the near complete defeat of Japan.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.940]   And where both sides in different ways, accept defeat.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.080]   What I'm pointing out in the book is that most wars
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.680]   don't end with one side accepting defeat.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.840]   And generally the war continues after the battles end.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.640]   This is something that's hard for Americans to understand.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.000]   Our system is built with the presumption of a war is over.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.800]   When we sign a piece of paper, everyone can go home.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.960]   It's not what happens.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.680]   - I mean, Civil War is a special case.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.160]   It's especially a strong case of that
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.520]   because the people that fought the war
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.080]   is still living in that land.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.040]   - That's exactly right.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.320]   - And in this case, some of them are leaders also.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.880]   - Many of them become the leaders of the very areas
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.840]   that they were leading before.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.440]   And I think that's another lesson here too
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.680]   that we did undertake after World War II,
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.800]   though in a flawed way.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.680]   We had a Nuremberg system.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.040]   We did prohibit at least Nazi leaders
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.080]   from coming back into power.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.360]   We made an exception for the emperor in Japan,
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.000]   but we generally followed the same rule in Japan.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.640]   Whereas in the United States, as I point out,
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.520]   many of the leaders of the Confederacy,
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.160]   first of all, don't surrender.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.280]   They flee to Mexico.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.320]   Then they come back after they lose in Mexico a second time,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.520]   they come back to the United States
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.880]   and they get elected to office.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.640]   The guy who writes the election laws in Texas,
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.120]   Alexander Watkins Terrell,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   most people don't know this even in Texas,
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.600]   he was a Confederate general, fled to Mexico.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.240]   So he committed treason by joining the army of Maximilian,
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.080]   emperor of Mexico, who was put in power by Louis Napoleon.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.000]   After Maximilian's defeated,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.160]   Alexander Watkins Terrell comes back to Texas,
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.360]   runs for the state legislature
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.480]   and then writes the election laws.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.320]   It's crazy.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.440]   - Can you make the case for that,
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.400]   that that's a feature of the American system, not a bug,
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.600]   that that is an implementation of justice,
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.960]   that you forgive,
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.800]   that you don't persecute everybody
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.680]   on the other side of the war?
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.520]   - Maybe, and I think that's a good feature
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.120]   in terms of lower level individuals,
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.320]   but I think a bad feature of our system
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.320]   is we do allow elite figures who have committed wrongdoing,
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.240]   we give them many ways to get out of punishment.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.560]   You are more likely to be punished in this society
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.600]   if you do something wrong and you're not an elite figure
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.960]   than if you are an elite figure.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.240]   - There should be a proportional,
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.640]   like forgiveness should be equally distributed across.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.480]   - And it's not.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.560]   - Yeah. - And it's not.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.120]   But we could change that, we could fix that.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.160]   - How do we fix that?
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.000]   (laughs)
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   How do we fix that?
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.520]   - What I think was argued at the end,
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.000]   this is one of the really important things
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:12.840]   about studying history,
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.280]   you learn about ideas that were not pursued
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.240]   that could be pursued today.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.880]   At the end of the Civil War,
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.720]   there was an effort to ban anyone
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.360]   who was in a leadership position in the Confederacy
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.800]   from ever serving in federal office again.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.560]   That's the third element of the 14th Amendment.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.600]   It's in the 14th Amendment.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.280]   The 14th Amendment clause three
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.440]   says that if you took an oath of office,
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.120]   meaning you were elected to office,
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.640]   you're an elite figure,
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.600]   and you violated that oath,
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.000]   you can still live in the country,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.280]   you can still get rich,
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.600]   but you can't run for elected office again.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.440]   - Yeah.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.360]   - And that, we've never really implemented that.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.920]   - Is it obvious that everybody
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.680]   who's in a leadership position on the Confederate side
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:59.360]   is a bad person for the future of the United States?
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.960]   Or is that just a safe thing to assume
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.640]   for the future of the nation?
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.440]   - I think it's the latter.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.120]   People do things for all kinds of reasons,
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.080]   and sometimes they have regrets.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.840]   That's also why we have the pardoning capability.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.960]   You could pardon someone individually
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.280]   if they show you that they've changed.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.680]   And it would only create fairness,
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.600]   because right now, let's say, Lex,
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.400]   you take out a huge, huge loan,
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.000]   and you don't pay your loan back,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.920]   that will go on your credit,
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.000]   and you won't get a big loan again.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.800]   You don't get to say, "Just give me another chance."
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.160]   You're gonna have to prove.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.680]   I think about holding public office in the same way.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.640]   If you've violated your credit rating on that,
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.360]   you should have a much higher road to go
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.760]   to prove to us that you should be back in office.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.160]   - How did the war end, in quotes?
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.280]   What was the, so you said,
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.440]   and you make this case in the book,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.320]   that in some sense, the elements,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.960]   the tensions behind the Civil War continue to this day,
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.320]   but officially, how did the war end?
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.720]   - So officially, the war ends at Appomattox
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.160]   in the early spring of 1865,
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   when Grant has pretty much smashed Robert E. Lee's army.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.840]   Appomattox Courthouse is a small town in Virginia,
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.600]   and the two men meet, and there are portraits of this,
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.200]   there's a painting of it we have in the book,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.240]   and Grant and Lee sign a paper,
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.200]   which basically allows Lee's soldiers
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.760]   to leave the battlefield,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.280]   and leave with their side arms to go back home.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.800]   That's pretty much the end.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.320]   Jefferson Davis, who's the president of the Confederacy,
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.640]   goes into hiding.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:43.640]   He's later captured, and then not convicted,
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.680]   but there's no formal settlement
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.680]   in the way there is at the end of World War II,
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.080]   where they meet in Yokohama Bay,
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.680]   the US and Japanese leaders in China.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.560]   This is not that.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.080]   - So what stands out to you as brilliant ideas
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.000]   during this time, and actions too, of Lincoln,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.880]   Abraham Lincoln?
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.560]   - So I mentioned his values.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.640]   I think a number of the things that he does
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.240]   that are quite extraordinary.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.440]   First, in emancipating the slaves.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.640]   Now, the slaves were freeing themselves,
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.720]   but Lincoln recognizes that he needs more labor
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.000]   in the Union Army,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.040]   and he recognizes that there's still a lot of resistance,
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.800]   and what he does is he makes the case
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.240]   for freeing the slaves based on the argument,
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.520]   not just of the moral value of that,
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.040]   but based on how that will benefit the North.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.960]   He's able to convince non-abolitionists
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.480]   to pursue abolitionist policies
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.320]   by serving their own interests.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.120]   What he's basically saying by 1863 or '64 is,
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.280]   "I can ask for more white soldiers,
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.920]   "or I can bring in former slaves.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.160]   "Would you like me to take your son,
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.560]   "or would you like me to put in?"
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.120]   It's the same thing Franklin Roosevelt does
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.280]   during World War II.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.600]   He says, "We need to build more planes,
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.800]   "and more tanks,
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.040]   "and I'm sending all the soldiers off to Europe.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.080]   "I've got all this African-American population
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.920]   "in the South.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.080]   "Wouldn't you like me to move them up to Chicago
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.960]   "so we can win this war and build things in the factories?"
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.680]   So Lincoln uses the war
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.040]   to move the country forward morally,
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.720]   even if at times he's convincing people
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.840]   by using other reasons,
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.200]   and I think that's great politics.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.600]   - I guess that's one of the components
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   of great leadership,
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.920]   is do the right thing
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.000]   for the wrong reasons.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.840]   (laughing)
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.200]   Or publicly sounding wrong reasons, yeah.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   - Find ways to move people.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.480]   What we talked about before,
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.640]   different stories move different people.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   So you can tell different stories.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.920]   He tells one set of stories
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.200]   to the religious leaders who are abolitionists,
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.480]   and a different set of stories to the New York bankers.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.360]   And that's leadership.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.680]   You tell different kinds of stories
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.640]   to move people to a new position.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.400]   The other thing Lincoln is really brilliant at
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.800]   is managing the international side of this.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.640]   So one of the real dangers for the Union
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.040]   is that the British will come in
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.200]   on the side of the Confederacy.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.680]   The Confederates expected the British would,
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.800]   'cause again, the Confederates
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.000]   were selling all their cotton to Britain.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   And they knew that the British leadership,
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.760]   first of all, was very happy to work
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:08.840]   with slave-holding societies,
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.960]   even though they didn't have slaves,
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.560]   and number two, that they believed the Union
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.560]   was getting too strong
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.480]   and threatening the British in Canada.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.880]   So there were many reasons the British
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.040]   might have gone in with the Confederates.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.360]   Lincoln mixes sticks and carrots with the British.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.640]   He threatens them, and when the British
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.240]   actually try to send diplomats
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   to negotiate with Southerners, he interdicts that.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.920]   He basically initiates a quarantine of the South.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.400]   On the other hand, he reaches out to them
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.360]   and tries to show that he wants better relations,
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.200]   and makes the argument that they will actually benefit more
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.960]   from having the industrial capability
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.120]   of the Union on their side.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.120]   So he's a very good diplomat.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.040]   - He is considered to be one of the great presidents
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.160]   in the history of the United States.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.760]   Are there ways that he failed?
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.800]   Is there things he could have done better?
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.520]   - So he failed in the ways that most great leaders fail,
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.920]   which is that he had a terrible succession plan.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:07.000]   His vice president, who I spend a lot of time on
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.160]   in the book, Andrew Johnson,
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.880]   who was probably our worst president ever,
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.640]   Andrew Johnson had no business being anywhere
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.000]   near the presidency.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Andrew Johnson was the only Southern senator
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   who did not secede.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   And so even though he was a Democrat,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.960]   Lincoln wanted to show that he was creating a unity ticket
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.400]   when he ran for re-election in 1864.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.720]   This happens today, right?
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.200]   So he put someone on as vice president
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.480]   who he didn't even like,
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.840]   but who he thought was politically useful.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.920]   Problem is, when Lincoln was assassinated,
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.960]   this guy took over.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.120]   Andrew Johnson was drunk at his own inauguration.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.840]   The guy was a true drunkard.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.040]   He was not prepared to lead in any sense,
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.320]   intellectually, politically,
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.200]   and he was against most of the principles Lincoln was for.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.360]   And the irony is that when Lincoln is assassinated
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.440]   in April of 1865, Andrew Johnson takes over
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.520]   and he has all the war powers Lincoln had.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.600]   That was not good planning by Lincoln.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.640]   And we can look back on it now and say,
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.240]   even though Lincoln is the first president
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.360]   who was assassinated,
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.240]   he should have known that there were people coming for him.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.920]   It wasn't inevitable that he'd be assassinated,
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.520]   but he should have had a backup plan for who would take over,
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.240]   hopefully someone who was capable of doing the job,
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.880]   and Andrew Johnson was not capable.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.240]   - So for me, for a person,
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.200]   if I were to put myself in Lincoln's shoes
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.920]   or anybody, any leadership position's shoes,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.040]   it is difficult to think about what happens after my death,
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.400]   after I'm gone, right?
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.840]   To plan well.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.960]   But at the same time,
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:43.160]   if you care about your actions to have a long-term impact,
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.360]   it seems like you should have a succession plan
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.760]   that continues on the path,
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.440]   that continues to carry the ideals that you've implemented.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.680]   So I'm unsure why people don't do that more often.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.240]   Like, I wonder how much Vladimir Putin
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.840]   spends percentage of time per day
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.320]   thinking what happens after he's gone
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.840]   to help flourish the nation and the region
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.640]   that he deeply cares for.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.760]   I wonder, and it's the same as for other presidents,
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.680]   Donald Trump, Joe Biden,
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.080]   they might think politically,
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.840]   like, how do I guarantee that it's a Democrat or a Republican
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.360]   but do they think like visionary for the country?
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.200]   I don't know, I wonder.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.160]   - I think that's very rare.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.320]   And I think what I understand from the literature
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.880]   among business people who talk about this a lot
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.160]   is what ends up happening is you become so powerful,
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.080]   you assume you're always gonna be in power.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.240]   You convince yourself of that.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.840]   You convince yourself that the end is far away.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.680]   And of course, for Lincoln,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.600]   the end could have been far away.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.040]   He was healthy, he was only in his 50s.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.160]   He could have lived a lot longer,
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.840]   but it also, it ended fast as it could.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.200]   And my understanding is that most Americans
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.120]   don't prepare their wills in the States.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.280]   And it doesn't matter whether they're rich or poor.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.920]   They assume things are just gonna go on
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.360]   because it's not fun to think about this.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.000]   - Yeah.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.040]   But I feel like it's freeing.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.320]   Like, you know what I did, which is interesting?
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.640]   Well, before I went to Ukraine, I recorded a video.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.000]   I set up a whole thing where I record a video,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.440]   like what happens if I die?
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.800]   I record a video to release,
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.440]   and I gave my brother access to my passwords,
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.840]   and I gave him instructions.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.800]   You're not allowed to look at this,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.120]   but please publish this if I die.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.920]   And you know, that made me,
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.320]   it sounds silly and ridiculous,
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   but that made me feel free to do the best thing I wanna do.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.920]   It's like, it's liberating.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.600]   So like, I guess that's for your will,
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.080]   but also like do the best possible damn job you can.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.200]   I feel like as a leader, having a plan what happens
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.960]   if you fail, and not if you fail, if you die,
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.880]   or you lose some of the oomph, some of the power,
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.560]   some of the momentum that is driving you currently,
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.360]   that there's going to be a handoff,
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.480]   where you will still be remembered as a great man or woman.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.120]   - But you identify one of the other problems, right?
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.920]   Which is one of the other reasons why someone like Lincoln,
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.480]   or certainly Henry Kissinger, doesn't create a successor.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.560]   Because you're afraid they're gonna steal your passwords.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.480]   You're afraid they're gonna steal the power from you.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.320]   - That's true.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.480]   - You had to find someone, your brother,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.120]   hopefully who you could trust.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:17.960]   - No, no, no.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.520]   - But let's just be clear.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.600]   - I love my brother, but he's a troll.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.720]   - So there's a feature on the password,
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.720]   on whatever password manager I may or may not use.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.080]   And there's a bunch of services like this.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.120]   It's interesting, I don't know if you know about this.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.680]   I've learned about all of this.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.800]   Is you can have them request access,
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.720]   and it's gonna wait 30 days before it gives them access.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.720]   So it's kind of has this built-in trust, trust padding.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.760]   But it's interesting, I mean, to me,
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.760]   on that aspect is just to have a plan
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.800]   in all aspects of life.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.800]   This is for leadership in your private life.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.200]   Like what happens to not just your will
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.840]   and your wealth or whatever,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.520]   but what happens to other stuff like social media
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.840]   and all of that in this digital world.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.200]   - And anything you care about if you want it to live on.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   And that's the problem.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   But unless you can devise a technical solution like that,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.960]   you have to give someone power now.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.080]   - Yeah, and that's the tricky thing.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.400]   I mean, democracy is a kind of technology.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.320]   You're gonna have to figure out how to do it correctly,
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.960]   how to have that power propagate,
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.360]   and especially during war,
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.680]   how you get everybody together
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.320]   into this warmongering mood.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.080]   And then how do you like come down from that
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.240]   and just relax?
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.080]   - Precisely.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.160]   - So in some sense, that's what Andrew Johnson,
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.880]   that was the problem is the over-centralization of power.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.480]   - It was the over-centralization of power,
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   but it was also that Lincoln had a designated successor
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.520]   who was going to do and tried to do everything
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.480]   that ran against what Lincoln was doing.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.720]   And it set the country back.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.880]   We went forward at the end of the Civil War,
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.880]   and then we went backward.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.720]   More so than we would have if there had been a new election.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.480]   Because if there had been a new election,
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.800]   there still would be reason for that person running,
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.960]   even if they were on the other side,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.320]   to try to find some compromise positions.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.920]   Andrew Johnson inherited power
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.520]   with very few limitations on how he used that power.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.920]   Congress wasn't even in session.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.960]   And so this became very directly a problem
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.240]   because Andrew Johnson started pardoning Southerners,
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.440]   allowing them to come back into power.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.080]   - So he had like a few months where he just went wild.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.200]   - Yeah.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.320]   It's giving the car keys to someone
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.520]   who's not prepared to drive,
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.240]   but decided that they're gonna do what they want
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.480]   with the car for a while.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.320]   - All right.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.840]   Is there any level to which power corrupted Lincoln?
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.760]   A war president?
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.520]   - Yes, I do think there were some areas.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.320]   And I think that even though he was a great president,
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.000]   if not our greatest president,
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.560]   maybe one of the greatest figures of our history,
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.480]   he was flawed.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.480]   One is his problem of succession,
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.480]   but also I think Lincoln over-invested
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.840]   in the power of the presidency.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.560]   He came to believe too much in the role of one man
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.560]   and not in creating a more balanced approach to governance.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.640]   And that's a function of war.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.240]   That's where war is dangerous.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.040]   War has an inherent centralizing power in a democracy.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.920]   That is dangerous because even when you have
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.440]   the best of people running a war,
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   that gives them a lot of power to make decisions.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.840]   - Yeah, how do you come down from that?
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.960]   I see that was Zelensky and Putin currently.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.000]   - Yep. - It's a war.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.920]   How do you come down?
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.320]   'Cause Ukraine and everybody,
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.680]   anybody in a war kind of,
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.000]   especially if you're fighting for the ideal of democracy,
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.520]   it seems like war is anti-democratic.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.360]   - It is.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.320]   - So how do you come down from that?
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.200]   What's the interesting mechanism of,
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.560]   I mean, some of it is leadership.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.680]   You have to be like a George Washington type figure
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:56.440]   to be able to walk away from power.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.840]   - I think you gave the answer right there.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.200]   You need to walk away from power
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.160]   or you need to be forced to walk away from power.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.320]   Historically, one of the things that democracies
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.160]   have tended to do when they have a chance
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.880]   is to vote out of office the victor in the war.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.380]   Think about Winston Churchill.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.120]   Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.600]   when he's still in the war.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.480]   It's not clear that he would have been elected again,
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.800]   let's say he lived on,
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.560]   because there is a sensibility
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.560]   that the person has become too powerful in this role
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.640]   and that someone else should now step in,
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.320]   someone else who's also not a war president
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.520]   but has other interests.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.100]   So let's hope Ukraine wins this war.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.200]   Zelensky should then step down
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.160]   or someone else should be voted in.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.840]   It will be dangerous if he remains president.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.680]   Let's say he wins somehow and a true victory,
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.480]   just as a hypothetical.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.040]   He should not be, he should be praised,
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.440]   maybe given a nice villa,
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.160]   but someone else should take over
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.560]   because the problem is that he's gonna have too much power
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.200]   and honestly, he's going to be too out of touch
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.300]   with what the country needs after the war.
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.340]   - What do you think would have happened if Lincoln had lived?
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:11.040]   That's the sort of counterfactual view of history.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.620]   It's an interesting question that probably
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.640]   you think about a lot, this gets raised a lot.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.480]   What would have happened if he didn't get assassinated?
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.920]   - It's a reasonable question
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.040]   because it was not inevitable he'd be assassinated.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.720]   He could have had more protection that night.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.360]   He'd invited Ulysses Grant to go to the theater with him
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.960]   and Grant and his wife didn't go.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:26.800]   If they had been there,
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.420]   there would have been more protection for Grant.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.040]   So he would have had at least double the security there.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.160]   So there are many ways in which he might not have died.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:37.880]   I think it still would have been a difficult transition,
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.000]   but I think there were a few things
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:39.840]   that would have been better.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.320]   First of all, Lincoln would not have pardoned
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.720]   all of these Confederate leaders
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.720]   and allowed them to come back into power.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.560]   Lincoln also would have been a better politician
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.600]   at holding his Republican coalition together.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.080]   And I think Lincoln was more committed
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.320]   to empowering former slaves and others.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.400]   So we still would have had a lot of conflicts,
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.440]   but I think what would have been a degree of difficulty
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.960]   was doubled or tripled because Lincoln was removed
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.840]   and the opposite came into power with Andrew Johnson.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.440]   - So you don't think there's a case you made
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.440]   that Andrew Johnson turned out to be a bad decision,
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.240]   but the spirit of the decision is the correct one?
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.560]   - No, I think it was a terrible decision
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.400]   because you should never put someone one step away
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.760]   from enormous power who's not prepared.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.760]   - Oh, in that sense.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.680]   - Yeah. - So in that sense, I got it.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.840]   But the other, the spirit of the decision,
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840]   meaning you put somebody who's in,
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.480]   represents a very opposing viewpoint than you.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.920]   - Well, I'm for that so long as that person is on board
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.000]   with some of the basic values that you're pursuing
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.040]   and that person is capable of doing the job.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.520]   - Well, do you think that was obvious to him
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.560]   that Andrew Johnson was not capable of doing the job?
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.200]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.040]   - It's in the, I mean, everyone recognized that,
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:52.980]   but it made sense.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.240]   I mean, what Lincoln has to be praised for
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.520]   is in the midst of a war,
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.120]   when at that point he was not doing well,
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.960]   the war was not going well, he ran for re-election.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.640]   He didn't try to postpone the election.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.240]   He didn't try to do anything. - Yeah.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.120]   - And so he needed all the help he could get when running.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.760]   And so he wanted to have someone on there
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.000]   who looked like a unity candidate
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.640]   who could appeal to some Southerners.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.040]   So it made sense from a political point of view,
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.280]   but it created a really big problem.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.760]   And there were people who said he should have removed
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.280]   Johnson as soon as he was elected.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.360]   And in retrospect, he probably should have.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.640]   - How gangster is that to,
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.000]   during a war still run the election?
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:30.840]   - It's extraordinary.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.400]   I mean, he, Lincoln believed in democratic values.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.480]   He also believed he would win,
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.400]   but he knew it was not guaranteed.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.480]   - Yeah. - And it's interesting
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.600]   for people who don't know this,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.320]   the reason we have mail-in balloting in the US
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.520]   is because of that.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.040]   So almost, what?
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.240]   I think almost a million union voters
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.120]   are away from their homes.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.080]   And so how do they vote?
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.160]   As soldiers, as nurses, they vote by mail.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.120]   The post office delivers their ballots.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.480]   That's why we have mail-in balloting.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.160]   - What about the other counterfactual question
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.760]   of what would have happened
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.480]   if Confederate States won the war?
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.400]   - The Confederate States had won the war,
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.680]   you would have seen, I think, a separate country.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.160]   In the South, you would have seen two countries.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.520]   And that Confederate country
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.080]   would have been a smaller country,
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.960]   but it probably would have been able to defend itself
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.960]   because it would have actually gotten much richer
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.800]   than it was.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.640]   It was poor at the time,
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.440]   but through its cotton trade and other things,
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.120]   it would have been recognized by Great Britain,
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.880]   by France, by other societies.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.760]   And you would have seen a Southern Republic.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.720]   I don't think you would have seen
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.160]   that Southern Republic dominate the continent.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.740]   The Union had the men and people and had the resources,
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.480]   but you would have seen a rival Republic
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.440]   to the United States in the South.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.320]   - Do you think they had interest to dominate the continent,
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.840]   to take over the Union?
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.100]   - They had a foreign policy, they had a plan.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.100]   Many have written about this.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.920]   They had plans, many Southerners did,
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.400]   of expanding into the Caribbean,
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.160]   which was actually more feasible.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.660]   They did not have the personnel
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.240]   to occupy so much territory going out West,
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.520]   if you think about the amount of land
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.780]   that had to be covered.
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:08.960]   But they had the nautical capabilities and naval power
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.380]   and the money to dominate islands in the Caribbean
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.480]   and those islands were important for their trade.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.600]   So there were many Southerners
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.360]   who wanted to take control of Cuba,
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.440]   wanted to take control of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.800]   And so you probably would have seen
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.080]   Southern warfare in those areas.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.560]   - From a counterfactual history perspective,
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.100]   can you make the case that secession
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.600]   would have been created a better world?
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   Like if we're sitting today and do back to the future thing,
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.780]   a secession in this context,
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.000]   if we put aside the suffering
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.140]   and the loss of life in the war,
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.300]   that we'd be in a better world today?
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.060]   Just looking at the political climate.
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:56.100]   And can you also make the case that actually this outcome
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.260]   of the Union winning the war is the better one?
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.460]   - I think the Union victory is by far the better outcome,
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.420]   because I think what you would have had otherwise
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:07.860]   is you would have had a slave republic in the South
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.120]   that would have encouraged slavery
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.200]   in other parts of the world, would have exported slavery,
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.060]   and would have necessarily been hostile
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:20.000]   to many of the positive changes that occur in the Union.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.280]   The movement toward progressive reforms,
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.020]   creating cities with health codes and public education,
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:25.860]   and many of those things.
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:28.160]   Public education really develops in the North
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.840]   as a way of training workers who are being paid
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.480]   to be better workers in a factory.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.160]   There's a reason you don't educate slaves,
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.120]   'cause if you educate slaves, they rebel.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.480]   - Yeah, so don't you think there'll be a huge pressure
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.120]   from the North to abolish slavery anyway?
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.280]   - There would have, but I think the South
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.460]   could have survived without another war.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.440]   I mean, I think the way that slavery
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.220]   would have ended in the South,
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.520]   if it didn't end with the Civil War,
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520]   it would have been with another war.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.960]   - I guess the deeper question is,
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.860]   is it better to work through your problems together,
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.600]   or is it better to get a divorce?
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.800]   - I think in this case, it was better to work
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.640]   through the problems,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.520]   it's not even working through them together,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.760]   it's better to work through the problems
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.960]   where one side has the resources to incentivize you
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.460]   to work through the problems,
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.040]   rather than leaving you on your own
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.080]   to go your own direction.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:21.520]   I think the argument against the union winning
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.960]   would be the argument that would be made
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.680]   by those who believe they suffered from union power
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.660]   later on.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.400]   So you could argue,
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.500]   if you're a historian of Native Americans,
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.780]   if you're a historian of the Philippines,
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.160]   you could argue some of the areas
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.880]   where this newly united nation coming out of the Civil War
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.600]   was able to use its power to spread its influence,
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.480]   it would have been harder for the union to do that
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.840]   if the union had to deal with a rival to the South.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:51.440]   - So as a historian, the union won,
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.000]   to which degree are the people from the union,
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.480]   that is now the United States,
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.080]   the writers of the history,
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.760]   that color the perspective of who's the good guys
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.840]   and the bad guys?
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.880]   So this is such an interesting question because-
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.800]   - I like how you take every question I ask
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.960]   and make it into a better question.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.120]   That's a deep, I deeply appreciate it.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.440]   Unless every time I ask some ridiculous question
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.480]   and you go, "That's really interesting."
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.880]   - No, because they're really good questions,
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.800]   they're thoughtful questions.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.120]   You know, actually the best questions
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.440]   are not the simple ones, right?
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.280]   So,
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:29.180]   the axiom is that the winners write history.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.320]   And that's usually the case, right?
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.200]   Most of the history I learned about Ukraine
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.440]   when I was growing up was written by Russians.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.140]   It was Russian history of Ukraine.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.840]   Most of the history of Europe has been written
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.520]   by Germans and French and British citizens, right?
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.360]   I mean, so usually it's that way.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.520]   And for the most part, our history has been written
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.800]   from a sort of Northeastern point of view.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:49.880]   But it's very interesting,
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:52.300]   the history of the years after the civil war
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.920]   that I focus on in this book
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.320]   has largely been written by the losers.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.400]   Because the union and its legacies,
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400]   and I grew up in New York,
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.760]   so I'm growing up as a legacy of that, right?
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.540]   Those were individuals who wanted to write about
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.560]   what happened long after the civil war,
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.600]   when the North got rich.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.200]   All those beautiful buildings in New York,
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.680]   all that wealth in New York, it's 1880s, '90s,
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.240]   late 19th century, it's the Gilded Age.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.200]   And that's what Northerners wanna write about, right?
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.560]   Because there's glory there.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.360]   The 20 years or so after the civil war,
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.620]   the years that really count, 1865 to 1880 or so,
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.360]   those years are ugly, it's messy.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.720]   And so who wrote about them?
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.120]   Southerners wrote about them.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.120]   And they wrote a story that was about
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.120]   Northern carpetbaggers and corrupt African-Americans.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.440]   And this is the story that Americans learned
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.160]   until a few years ago.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.040]   I've gone around the country talking about this book,
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.140]   and the number of people have told me
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.200]   they never learned this basic history.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.760]   Because they grew up in Chicago,
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:50.960]   not because they grew up in Texas,
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.700]   'cause they grew up in Chicago.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.640]   And the story they were told, the civil war ended,
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.240]   oh, now let's talk about the Chicago World's Fair in 1893,
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.200]   and how Chicago is coming of age as this great city.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.760]   We don't like to write history in our country
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.520]   that's not about glory.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.480]   I'm all for the greatness of our country,
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.040]   but you become great by studying your failures
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.920]   as well as your successes.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.560]   And that's a real problem we have.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.120]   - And I would love to see a kind of humility
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.160]   from a history perspective.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.640]   One of the things that always surprised me
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:23.240]   just coming from the Soviet Union to the United States,
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.780]   as you've, I think, spoken about,
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.040]   is the perspective on World War II,
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.520]   and who was the critical component of winning the war.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.280]   Obviously, in the Soviet Union,
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.680]   it's a great patriotic war,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.400]   the Soviet Union are the ones that suffered,
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.920]   and often actually don't emphasize the suffering,
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.440]   they emphasize the glory,
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.260]   that they defeated this huge evil.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.920]   But then you listen to the United States'
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.600]   perspective on this, and it's almost like,
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.360]   I mean, there's several ways of phrasing it,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.440]   but basically the United States won the war,
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.260]   without the United States it would be impossible
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.140]   to win the war, they were the turning point,
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:59.080]   they were the,
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.380]   my last, my everything, that song,
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.980]   my first, my last, my everything.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:09.380]   So that, and I'm sure, I wonder what,
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:14.380]   growing up in, maybe after war in Britain,
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:16.260]   I wonder if there's history books written there
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.780]   that basically say, and they could also make
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.780]   a pretty strong case, that Britain was central
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.780]   to the turning point.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.020]   You could really make a strong case that
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:28.020]   Churchill and Britain were the turning point
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:30.380]   of the war, they're responsible for some
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.700]   of the first failures, major failures of Hitler
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.660]   from a military strategy perspective.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.500]   But that's interesting to look at that very recent history
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.180]   from very different perspectives.
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.600]   - And it's the same problem with the Civil War,
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.020]   we wanna tell the story of the Union winning the war,
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.320]   and then everything is good.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.160]   - Yeah.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.280]   - And it's not the way it worked.
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.700]   What I'm really trying to get at is,
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.740]   when you love your country, you have to study the failures.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.580]   - Yeah.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:57.740]   - Because by studying the failures,
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:58.940]   that's how you improve yourself,
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.660]   and that's where you see where real courage is.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.580]   It's actually that Lincoln failed for so long
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.340]   that makes him a great president.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.880]   He lost more battles than he won, but he learned,
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:10.860]   and he got it right in the end.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:11.920]   Same with Ulysses Grant.
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.320]   I don't want generals, I'm just echoing Lincoln here.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.740]   I don't want generals, I don't want leaders
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.260]   who think they're gonna get it right the first time,
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.220]   'cause they're never gonna get it right the first time.
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:20.360]   You never get it right the first time
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.460]   in an AI experiment, right?
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:25.100]   It's those who can work through failure learn from failure.
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:28.680]   And we as a society have to start doing that better.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.340]   We have to not just trumpet the successes.
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.960]   Let's talk about where we failed as Republicans,
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.180]   as Democrats, as Independents,
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:37.640]   and let's move forward from there.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.960]   - In recent years have been a kind of movement
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.660]   of highlighting some of the hypocrisy,
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.540]   sort of highlighting the racism,
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:48.000]   the fact that many of the founding fathers
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.180]   were slave owners, that kind of thing,
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:55.180]   sort of highlighting from the current ethics of our world,
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.140]   showing that many of the people involved
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:00.420]   in the war on the East Side were evil.
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.700]   What do you think about that perspective on history?
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.940]   - I think it's super valuable.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:07.420]   I think we should expose the gap
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.580]   between ideals and practice.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.580]   But that doesn't mean we should throw away
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.980]   the great people who are also hypocrites,
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:16.980]   'cause everyone I've studied is a hypocrite.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:17.820]   I'm a hypocrite.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:19.580]   I think I'm a pretty good father.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.680]   Luckily, my son is an even better mother.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.700]   But there are parts of me that, I mean,
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:26.860]   I often find myself telling our children
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.020]   to do things that I didn't do, right?
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:30.900]   But they're smart and they recognize that
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:32.420]   and they learn something from that.
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.700]   So let's not cover over the hypocrisy,
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:37.660]   but let's not throw people away for being hypocritical.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:39.020]   Here's my view of Thomas Jefferson,
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.300]   which is similar to my view of Abraham Lincoln, right?
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.260]   These are incredibly insightful, thoughtful people
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:46.500]   who added so much to our country,
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.000]   but they also created flawed systems.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.140]   And one of, excuse me, Jefferson's flaws
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.900]   was even though he saw all the evils of slavery,
[01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:58.180]   he was a terrible farmer and he could not imagine
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.340]   living the lifestyle he lived without slaves.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.740]   He could never work his way out of that.
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:03.580]   But that doesn't make
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:05.620]   the Declaration of Independence less valuable.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.980]   In fact, it makes it more valuable.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.180]   There's more that we can learn from that.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:12.180]   - And to me, on the hypocrisy side,
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.380]   many of the people that participate in cancel culture
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.380]   and these kinds of movements
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:20.180]   that call everything is racist and so on,
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.420]   sometimes they're highlighting properly
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.700]   the evils in our current society,
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:29.740]   but the hypocrisy they have is not realizing
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:34.140]   if they were placed in Germany in the '40s,
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.900]   if they were placed in the position of being
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:40.540]   a white Christian during slavery
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.100]   at the founding of this country,
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.680]   they would do the same thing.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.760]   They would do the evils they're now criticizing.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.720]   Most of them.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:52.680]   So it takes a truly heroic human to think outside,
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:56.920]   to be aware of all the evils going on around you
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:58.440]   and take action.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.040]   It's easy now on Twitter to call people as racist.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.440]   What's hard is to see the racism when you're living in it
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.320]   and your wellbeing is funded by it.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.160]   - Yep.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:08.980]   I think that's right.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:11.760]   I think to analyze ourselves and look honestly
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.400]   in the mirror is very hard.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.360]   I also think I make this point in actually all of my books,
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:20.080]   the real, and it's an Eli Wiesel point,
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.520]   that a lot of the evil in our world is the evil of silence
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.280]   and just looking away.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.540]   And one form of that on Twitter is just hitting like.
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:32.560]   It's a cheap way of pretending
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:35.160]   you're doing something that's important, right?
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.360]   After the civil war,
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.500]   there's all sorts of bad stuff that happens.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.960]   I talk about it a lot.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.320]   There always are people there who could stop it.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.840]   Most people are not responsible for the bad activities,
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.640]   but most don't do something to stop it.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.080]   And when I say do something, I mean really do something.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:52.920]   - Yeah, really.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.180]   And it's also to push back and push back,
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:48:00.000]   silence on Twitter is not what Eli Wiesel was talking about.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.840]   So sometimes silence on Twitter is the courageous action
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.440]   because you wait and think and learn
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.120]   and have patience to truly understand the situation
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.080]   before you take actual action,
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.320]   not participate in the outrage crowds on Twitter,
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.320]   the hysteria of cancellation.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.240]   What's hard to do is to speak up
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.800]   when everybody else is silent.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.760]   That's what's hard to do.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.160]   - Right, and to speak up against those
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.320]   who you thought were on your side.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.120]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.680]   Good luck to those on the left
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.120]   who speak up against the left.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.840]   And the same, good luck to those on the right
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.360]   who speak up against the right.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.400]   It's a lonely place.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.480]   It's a painful place.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:40.240]   That's why walking in the center is tough.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.000]   You get attacked by both sides.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]   It's a wonderful, wonderful journey.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.800]   - And you know what's interesting to me
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.040]   and what I learned writing this book,
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.040]   every book is a journey.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.880]   What I learned in the laboratory of this book, right,
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.120]   was a lot of those figures who do stand up,
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.080]   even in their own lifetime,
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.840]   they don't get the accolades they deserve,
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.080]   but they make a difference.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.960]   And that's maybe not enough comfort
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.240]   because you wanna see benefits in your own lifetime,
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:09.320]   but I think it really matters.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:10.600]   And many of the figures I talk about
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.600]   were not even well-known in their time.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.600]   So you can make a difference.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.820]   You do impart something small in the universe
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.400]   that can grow into something better,
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.760]   and we shouldn't forget that.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.800]   - Yeah, that's why I admire "Boxer the Horse."
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.780]   I will work harder even if he gets sent to the slaughter
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.720]   by the evil pigs.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.840]   - You're on Orwell today.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.720]   I love that. - I'm on recently.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.560]   I mean, "Animal Farm" is one of my favorite books.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.320]   I've been recently, I just am rereading "1984" now.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.680]   It's been politicized, that book in general.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.960]   But to me, it's a love story.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.800]   - It is a love story.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.960]   - That there's, like, love is the,
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:49.160]   it's a story of an oppressive government,
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.680]   a surveillance state, and the nature of truth
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:54.640]   being manipulated by wartime, da, da, da, da, da, so on.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.080]   But the beacon of hope in the human heart
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.480]   that pulls you out, that wakes you up
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.920]   in a world like that is a love of another human being.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920]   - It's transcendence, I totally agree.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.840]   My understanding, you would know better than I would,
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.280]   is that it's now a best-selling book in Russia again.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:12.120]   - "1984"?
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.400]   - Yeah, it's actually being downloaded more.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.840]   There was a piece on NPR, I heard about this, actually.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.280]   Well, I hope it's because they're looking for love.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.720]   - That's what I was just gonna say.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.320]   Hopefully not in all the wrong places.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.880]   - Hey, there's no such thing as the wrong places.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.520]   But that's my opinion.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.080]   I'm the one that showed up naked and drunk
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.440]   to your classroom.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.720]   - I'm still surprised that was you.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.920]   (laughing)
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.240]   - I was wearing a wig, I'm sorry.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.120]   Quick pause.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:36.960]   Can I take a breath?
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.920]   (laughing)
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:41.940]   - And we're back.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:45.440]   John Willock Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.400]   In his diary, as you write in your book,
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.200]   he wrote about Lincoln,
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.520]   "Our country owed all her troubles to him,
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.400]   "and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.920]   "The country is not what it was."
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.400]   What was the idea of the country
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.920]   that John Willock Booth believed in?
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:04.080]   You talked about this country
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.960]   that just constantly being repeated in his writing.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.000]   - For John Willock Booth and many other people
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.920]   who are close to the southern part of the country
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.480]   in the Confederacy,
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:15.680]   they believe the country should be a democracy
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.120]   for white people, a bounded democracy.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.760]   And Booth was horrified,
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.560]   and we have to empathize with it, not sympathize,
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.320]   but recognize how strange it seemed to him
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.120]   that all of a sudden those who were slaves
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.600]   were now soldiers with guns.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.720]   And he was particularly offended
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:35.200]   when he saw in Washington, D.C.,
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.480]   a group of African-American Union soldiers
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.240]   holding southern prisoners of war.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:42.540]   And the world was turned upside down for him.
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.520]   Democracy for him, he believed in democracy,
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520]   but democracy for white people.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.940]   And that justified mistreating black people for him.
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:57.880]   - So country means white people.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:01.320]   - Yeah, and I don't think it's that different from--
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.360]   - And white Christians.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.200]   - White Christians, yes.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:07.160]   Yeah, he was not arguing for Jewish emancipation either.
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.520]   I don't think that's really different
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.400]   from what we've seen in the 20th century
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.960]   for people who justify ethnic cleansing or genocide.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.440]   Let's go to the extreme example of Hitler again
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.760]   that we've talked about before.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.280]   His view was actually,
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:26.880]   he claimed he wanted a democracy for Germany.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.320]   He wanted a democracy of the right Germans,
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.720]   and he wanted those who he saw infecting
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.840]   and mongrelizing the society out.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.080]   That's in essence what John Wilkes Booth thought.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:39.440]   - The scary thing is those kinds of ideas,
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.480]   you can put a pretty face on them.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.040]   Like you don't have to use,
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.400]   and maybe Hitler didn't until the war started,
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.080]   or even parts of the war make it so clear
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.960]   that you just want the certain kind of Germans
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.680]   that have made Germany a great nation
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.680]   to be the people that are running that nation,
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.060]   and other people who are not truly interested in,
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.080]   don't hold the interest of the country at heart.
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.840]   They should go elsewhere where they can flourish also,
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.300]   it's wonderful, but like the good Germans,
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:10.840]   they've built all these amazing things,
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.480]   we should give them the power and not to the others,
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:16.320]   and you can put a bunch of flowery language around that.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.760]   - Precisely, it's the argument that's made all the time
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.080]   today against immigration,
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.040]   that the wrong people are coming into our society.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.200]   It's ironic 'cause it's often made
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.240]   by those who themselves are immigrants.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.080]   History teaches us that those who have arrived
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.700]   as immigrants are no more likely to like those who come,
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.680]   in fact they might be against the next group
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:34.600]   for just this reason,
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.060]   'cause they think they're the right group.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.780]   - Can you describe to me if it's useful at all
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:41.720]   to know the difference,
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.280]   if there's a difference between white nationalism,
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:48.620]   white supremacism, and Christian nationalism?
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:51.080]   Is there an intersection between them?
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:55.580]   I've heard these terms used, oh, separatism too, right?
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.100]   Is there an interesting distinction that permeated
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.620]   that history that still lasts today?
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:05.960]   - I think there's a long history in the United States
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.340]   of a belief in white supremacy,
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.660]   and it's not unique to the United States,
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:11.840]   we actually inherit this from Europe.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:17.740]   And white supremacy is the belief that for whatever reason,
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:21.100]   those with lighter colored skin,
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.820]   usually of Northern European extraction,
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.140]   are superior, have more rights,
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:28.100]   are the better people to make decisions,
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:28.940]   all sorts of things.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.460]   It's an aesthetic judgment
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.500]   as much as it is a political judgment,
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.540]   and that gets embedded in our society, right?
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.600]   We inherit that.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:40.020]   Christian nationalism is the presumption
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.060]   that it's not just your race,
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.960]   but now it's also your Christian belief.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.340]   And that is actually relatively new.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:49.780]   There are little pieces of that in our history.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:53.260]   But many of those who are white supremacists,
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:54.620]   even those in the Confederacy,
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:56.820]   are not Christian nationalists,
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:00.040]   because they don't agree on which kind of Christianity,
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.340]   and they don't view those
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.780]   who are from a different denomination of Christianity
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.280]   as being good Christians.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:08.380]   There isn't this big tent Christianity in the 19th century.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:12.580]   This notion that there is one Christian nation
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:14.260]   and that we're all part of it,
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:17.480]   that's actually really a 20th century creation.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.480]   It precedes the evangelical movement,
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.980]   but it's been made even more popular.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:24.160]   But it would not make sense to a Confederate
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.340]   to say we're a white Christian nation.
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:30.160]   It would make sense to say we're a white Protestant nation,
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.180]   'cause they didn't consider Catholics good Christians,
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:34.120]   or a white Presbyterian nation.
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.060]   And so that's something new,
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:40.300]   and I think what's particularly dangerous
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.180]   about this notion of Christian nationalism
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:45.860]   is it creates this false history,
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:47.980]   saying we've always been together as Christians,
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:50.240]   that's always how we've defined ourselves,
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.500]   and that's not accurate.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:52.920]   - Well, one interesting thing,
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:57.400]   so I recently talked to a left-leaning
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:01.100]   or maybe a far-left political streamer named Destiny,
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:04.180]   Stephen Bunnell, I don't know if you're familiar with him.
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:06.980]   He does live streaming debates with people.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.020]   It's very passionate.
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:09.380]   - I've heard of this, my students have told me.
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.820]   I have not actually seen it.
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.860]   My students are always up on the most hip things.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:15.540]   - Yes, that is, no, no, the funny thing about him,
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:17.360]   he's already considered like a boomer.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.740]   He's already the old streamer,
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:20.100]   'cause he's been doing it for 10 years.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.740]   He's not the cool kid anymore.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:25.400]   Anyway, he goes into some difficult political territory,
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.400]   and he actually had a mini conversation with Nick Fuentes,
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.720]   and he says, I mean, some of it is humor,
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:34.540]   but some of it is pretty dark,
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:37.940]   hard-hitting sort of criticism is,
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.320]   he says that anyone who claims
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:42.280]   to be a Christian nationalist asks them
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.960]   if they would rather have a million people
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:50.600]   who are atheists from Sweden, who are white, come,
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.600]   or if you would rather have a million people from Africa
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.780]   who are Christian, come.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:01.220]   And the truth comes out, that this is a very surface level,
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:03.100]   this kind of idea of Christian nationalism
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:06.300]   is still, underneath it is a deep racism,
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:08.740]   like hatred towards black people.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:10.420]   - I think that's, I'm sure that's right.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.260]   I'm sure that's right.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.380]   - That's the sense I got into it,
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:15.160]   does not seem to have deep kind of,
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.300]   yeah, like historical context to it.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.080]   It's just a different, a rebranding of the old kind of hate.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.920]   - What I think is important though,
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.480]   in drawing this distinction,
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.200]   and why it really matters beyond the history of it,
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.960]   is someone like Lincoln quotes scripture all the time.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.800]   The second inaugural is filled,
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.920]   second inaugural address, Gettysburg Address,
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:38.240]   filled with biblical references,
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.760]   but he does it in a way that's not Christian nationalist,
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.160]   because he's using the text to bring people together.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.020]   He's using it as a fable of humanity.
[01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:51.100]   And you could say, he's not open to Islamic thinking,
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:53.180]   he's ignorant of the Islamic world.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:57.060]   But as a Jew, I'm a Jew, reading and studying Lincoln,
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:58.360]   I know he's a Christian,
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:01.100]   but I don't feel excluded from his rhetoric.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:04.740]   Because I share that Bible, we have different views,
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:06.300]   but I don't feel excluded.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.900]   It actually brings people together.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:10.100]   The Christian nationalist approach that we've seen
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:12.900]   in the 20th century, and especially in recent decades,
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.360]   is intended to divide people.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:17.120]   It excludes Jews.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.480]   It excludes Christians who don't interpret Christianity
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:21.620]   their way.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.560]   And to say that's what we've always done
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.280]   is an entire distortion of our country,
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.120]   and it also hides why this is so dangerous.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.240]   Insofar as Christianity matters to our country,
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.960]   it should be in the way Lincoln uses it,
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:36.600]   as a set of common texts that many of us resonate with,
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.180]   knowing that we have different rituals
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:39.560]   and different understandings,
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.840]   not as a way to exclude people,
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:44.440]   and not as a cover for racism, which is what it is.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.200]   - It's kind of interesting that you could talk about,
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.840]   I've talked to a lot of people,
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:50.840]   Muslim folks, Jewish folks, Christian folks,
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.800]   there's a way to talk about religion that's inclusive,
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.440]   and then that's exclusive.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:58.600]   I've been listening to a lot of these
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.920]   interfaith conversations, and they're awesome.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.840]   They celebrate the beauty of each religion,
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.400]   they banter and argue with each other
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:09.160]   about details and so on, but it feels like love.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.640]   It feels like anybody from any of those religions
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:14.720]   would feel welcome at that party.
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:16.220]   - And I think that's possible.
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:20.520]   - Can you tell me about the disputed election of 1876?
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.880]   - So this is fascinating.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.560]   The 1876 election is one of many elections,
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:28.480]   we've had some recently, that are intensely controversial.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:31.320]   And they're controversial because they're so close.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:33.000]   They're controversial 'cause it's not always clear
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.440]   who's won.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:38.640]   In 1876, Samuel Tilden, the governor of New York,
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.520]   who's running as a Democratic candidate,
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:44.080]   wins more votes across the country.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.320]   So everyone knows he becomes president, right?
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.520]   Wrong, he doesn't become president,
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.560]   because in three states, South Carolina,
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.520]   Louisiana, and Florida, it's very, very close.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.040]   And even though Tilden has more total votes,
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.520]   if he loses those states, the electors in those states,
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.720]   all of which go to the winner of the state,
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.640]   would actually make Rutherford B. Hayes,
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:06.560]   the Republican candidate president.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:07.560]   In all three of those states,
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:10.240]   you also have Republican governors who have just lost,
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:13.600]   but are still the people who have to certify the election.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.080]   All three states say that Hayes won,
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:18.120]   even though it's very close and disputed.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:20.200]   So Hayes has one more electoral vote.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.000]   Of course, the Democrats don't accept that.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.680]   And so we go into February,
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.760]   the inauguration was done in March, not in January.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.800]   We go from November to February,
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.480]   without clear agreement on who the president is.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:35.720]   In the end, there's an agreement that they come to a deal,
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.600]   which is where the Democrats will accept Hayes as president
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.400]   in return for Hayes doing all the things
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.760]   the Democrats want in the South.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:45.960]   And so in essence, you have a deal made
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:49.680]   that one side will get all it wants
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.720]   while allowing the other side to have the figurehead.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:54.280]   And so in a certain way,
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:58.160]   this marks a moment when the Confederacy wins.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:00:59.920]   For example, Hayes has to agree
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.760]   to pull out all federal force from the South,
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.200]   which means there's no protection
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.120]   for fair elections going forward.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.800]   And you'll see in states like Mississippi,
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.200]   the number of African-American voters will decline
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.080]   and not recover again until the late 20th century.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:17.320]   So that's what that election does.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.440]   And from 1876 until 1896,
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.200]   we have a series of elections that are very close.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.000]   It happens also in 1888
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.960]   that the person with the most popular vote loses,
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.800]   that's Grover Cleveland, who loses to Benjamin Harrison.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.960]   And again, we'll have the same issue
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.960]   where there's a dispute.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:39.520]   And so what that election shows us, 1876, 1888,
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.760]   is that our election system
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.400]   and the problem of having an electoral college
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.520]   really complicates things.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:46.560]   It makes it harder for us to come to any kind of consensus,
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.280]   any kind of agreement on who's won an election.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:50.960]   Super important for today
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.800]   because most of the 20th century,
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:55.000]   we don't have close elections, so it doesn't matter.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.320]   When we come to a world today
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.600]   where our elections are very close,
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:01.360]   our system is not well-designed to deal with those issues.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:04.480]   - Do you draw any parallels with our time
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.080]   and what are some key differences?
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.280]   There's been contested elections,
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.840]   Florida, Florida, Florida, with Al Gore,
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.920]   and there's been just contested election
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:15.400]   after contested election.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.400]   And of course, most famously recently
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.640]   with the contested election that led to January 6th.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:25.240]   - So I think a couple of parallels
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.200]   and a couple of differences.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:28.880]   One parallel is that when you have close elections,
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.960]   the losing side is never happy.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.840]   It's a myth that when you have a close election,
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:37.080]   the other side just accepts it and it's not,
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.320]   that doesn't happen.
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.320]   And we need to be attentive to that and ready for that.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.080]   January 6th actually should surprise us,
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.560]   not because it happened,
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.460]   but because it hadn't happened before.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:49.800]   People who lose a close election are never happy
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.760]   and they always think that something has been done.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:52.960]   That's one parallel.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.840]   Second parallel is elections are violent.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.440]   We have this myth that our elections are peaceful.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.280]   No, there's always violence involved in one way
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.680]   or another, violence in either trying to prevent people
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.880]   from voting or violence in preventing people
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:07.720]   from preventing people from voting, right?
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.200]   Elections are not peaceful walks in the park.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.080]   And that's why most countries have a centralized system
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.240]   to manage elections and provide protection for people.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.400]   We need to think about that.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.560]   A lot of people don't vote because they're afraid.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.480]   They don't wanna take the time,
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.440]   but they're also afraid that they're gonna anger someone
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:28.840]   or that they're gonna be seen as politicizing an issue.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:32.260]   Differences, in 1876, there was fraud in the election.
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:34.960]   There were people who voted two, three times.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:37.040]   One of the things the Ku Klux Klan did
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.200]   is it prevented black people from voting
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.680]   and that it helped white people go to multiple voting booths.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.920]   And this was quite common.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:46.460]   In the 1880s, if you went to vote,
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.560]   here's how it would happen in a place like Chicago
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.800]   and New York, the union boss from your factory
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.040]   would come and get you at the factory,
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:56.200]   give you lunch, get you drunk,
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.480]   and then drive you from one voting booth to another
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.280]   and give you a ballot that you would bring in
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.320]   and just, and he would watch you deposit that ballot.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.720]   - Sounds pretty nice, not gonna lie.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.680]   I'd take that ride.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:08.120]   - So that's a difference.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.060]   That is not how our elections work now.
[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:12.960]   One of our great accomplishments has been to eliminate
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.840]   virtually all the fraud in our elections.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.440]   How have we done that?
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.780]   By creating safeguards.
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:20.720]   It is very difficult.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.360]   All the evidence we have is that the minimal fraud
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.080]   that's occurred in elections are onesies and twosies,
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:29.160]   and it's never in the last 20 years had any big difference
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.160]   in the outcome of elections.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.200]   So that's a big difference.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:34.600]   And then another big difference I think is that
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.200]   in that time, the Democrats and Republicans
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.880]   are on the opposite sides of where they are now,
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:41.560]   and that changes everything.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:44.540]   So the Democrats then are the party of the Confederacy.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:46.340]   The Democrats are the party of exclusion.
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:49.200]   The Republicans are more the party of economic expansion.
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.760]   And the Republicans are the Big Ten party,
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.200]   we're reversed today.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.600]   - Do you think because there's much less election fraud now,
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:04.160]   like you described, one of the lessons we wanna maybe learn
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:06.840]   from that is there doesn't actually have to be election
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:10.140]   fraud for either side to claim there's election fraud.
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:12.800]   It seems like it's more and more common,
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:15.840]   and it seems to me that in 2024 election
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.980]   in the United States, if a Republican wins,
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:23.980]   there would also be just maybe just as likely
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:30.240]   as if a Democrat wins, that there'll be nuanced claims
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:36.680]   of election fraud, because it's become
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:37.720]   more and more normalized.
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:41.000]   - I think what this history shows is that our election
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.840]   system makes it easy for people to claim fraud
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:46.840]   because it's so unnecessarily complex.
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:48.720]   First of all, we don't have a system
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:49.920]   where the person who gets the most votes
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:51.340]   is necessarily the winner.
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:53.120]   So that already creates one problem.
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:55.900]   Second problem is everything I talk about this in the book
[02:05:55.900 --> 02:05:58.400]   is controlled at the county level.
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:01.620]   So what happens with Hayes and Tilden in 1876
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.280]   is you have one county official who says
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:05.200]   they think one person won, another county official
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:06.860]   thinks says the other person won.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:09.320]   There's no centralized system.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.660]   It would be as if we allowed every airport
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:13.220]   to control safety and airplanes,
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:14.400]   our airplanes would not be safe.
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.840]   Our airplanes are safe 'cause the FAA
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.700]   and the National Transportation Safety Board
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:20.120]   have strict universal guidelines
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:21.340]   for what makes for a safe plane.
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.500]   And therefore our planes generally
[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.040]   don't fall out of the sky.
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:26.560]   Our system is very complex.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:28.560]   It has complex rules and has too many people
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:31.160]   who have authority in too many different places.
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:34.360]   Complexity makes it easier for someone to make an argument
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.040]   that the wrong thing has been done.
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:37.460]   We should simplify the system.
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:40.320]   In Brazil, they had a very close election
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:43.320]   and it's very hard for Bolsonaro who lost
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.500]   that close election to claim there was fraud
[02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:47.880]   because there's a central authority run by the judiciary
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.080]   that counted the votes and it's just simple.
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:51.800]   It's not about which states,
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.600]   it's not about who the county officials were.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:55.520]   - Did he claim or no?
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:57.680]   - He has not acknowledged that he lost.
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:01.320]   - Right, so to push back on your statement,
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.000]   I'm undefeated monopoly and risk
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.520]   because anytime I lose, I walk away
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:09.480]   claiming there was fraud and cheating involved.
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.900]   And I refuse to believe otherwise.
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:15.900]   I just think that accusations of fraud is a narrative
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.600]   that's disjoint from the reality
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:19.320]   of whether there was or not fraud.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.840]   - Yeah, yeah, I agree, but I think we make it,
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:23.080]   we make it a little easier for that narrative
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:25.840]   by having a complex, convoluted system.
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.520]   - And I wonder if there's other improvements
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:29.200]   that take us into the 21st century
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:30.840]   that allow for electronic voting.
[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.200]   There's all kinds of improvements
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.160]   that it seems our system is dragging their feet on.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.280]   Rank choice, voting, all that kind of stuff.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.640]   - Let's make this clear.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.340]   We claim to be the greatest 21st century democracy
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.260]   and we still vote like the 19th century.
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:45.260]   We're not even in the 20th century.
[02:07:45.260 --> 02:07:47.120]   Most people, when they went to vote,
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.420]   they actually like, you know, checked a box
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:52.820]   and put a piece of paper in a box, right?
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:54.980]   I mean, that's not 21st century.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:57.120]   We can move millions of dollars,
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:00.540]   maybe billions for you, Lex, in a bank accounts
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.380]   from our keyboard. - Thank you.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.340]   - From our keyboards.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.380]   - Billions of rubles.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:06.500]   - Billions of pennies.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:07.860]   - Pennies.
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:11.220]   - Why can we move money safely and not vote in the same way?
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:13.500]   - And at the same time, so there's security there
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:14.780]   in the movement of money.
[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.720]   And then there's the actual engagement.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:20.020]   Most of us, depending on your age demographic,
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:23.220]   click like on Facebook or Twitter or TikTok
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:26.760]   tens of thousands of times a year.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:30.360]   I think this kind of mechanism of constantly,
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.380]   and a like is a vote.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:34.100]   So you're constantly voting, voting, voting, voting.
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:35.060]   We love voting.
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:37.420]   We love giving our opinion on that stuff.
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:40.780]   It just seems obvious that gamifying the system,
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.500]   which is essentially what the election is,
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:44.860]   making it fun to be engaged in different issues.
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:47.200]   And there's also be a case,
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.260]   now I don't understand these things deeply,
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:51.900]   but it always seemed to me that issue-based voting
[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:54.220]   should be the future.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.380]   It seems like too complicated to vote for singular people
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:00.020]   versus on ideas, which on Twitter,
[02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:03.340]   we don't necessarily vote for people, we vote for ideas.
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:06.820]   If you like a tweet or not, you like it and so on.
[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.340]   That too seems to be like a possibility for improvement.
[02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.180]   - Well, there's certainly a way to improve polling.
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.660]   We could measure public opinion better.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.700]   We still poll as if we're in the early 20th century.
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:17.060]   They still actually call people.
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.520]   It's amazing to me.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.860]   I was talking to one pollster.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:23.120]   They will call a hundred people and get one person,
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:24.340]   but they still do that.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.500]   - They probably still call landlines, right?
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.460]   - Yeah, well, they try to get cell phones too,
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.980]   but they do call landlines.
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.380]   But one could create a system that would be far better
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.620]   in the way you're describing it seems to me, Lex,
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:37.980]   to actually assess what people like and don't like.
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:41.300]   - So your book, your work in general,
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:45.220]   your perspective on history is, I would say,
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.620]   at least from my perspective, non-partisan.
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:48.460]   - Thank you.
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:50.980]   - Yeah, you do exceptionally good job with that,
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.120]   despite the attacks and the criticisms.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.820]   That said, you personally, just the way you speak,
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:57.900]   my judgment, and you can push back on this,
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:00.660]   I think you lean left in your politics
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:01.660]   on the political spectrum.
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.140]   Maybe you can push back on that.
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:05.980]   Can you make the case for either perspective
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:08.660]   on your own personality as a fan of yours
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:12.620]   that you do lean left or you don't lean left?
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:14.420]   - I think it depends on the kinds of issues
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.260]   we're talking about.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:18.820]   I do tend to lean left on the social and cultural issues.
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:22.260]   So I'm a believer, a firm believer.
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:23.700]   I didn't believe this when I was younger.
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:26.740]   I've come to believe that people should choose
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:29.240]   their own lifestyle and that we should get out of the way.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:33.060]   I'm a believer, deep believer as a father of a 20-year-old.
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:35.860]   Woman, that my 20-year-old daughter should have the right
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:38.700]   to make any choice she wants with her body.
[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:42.260]   And if she were to get pregnant at a fraternity party
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:45.680]   at college, she should have the right to decide
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:46.660]   whether to have a child or not.
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:50.740]   So on those issues that would code me left of center.
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:56.500]   I'm actually reasonably conservative on fiscal issues.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.620]   I don't think we should spend money we don't have.
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:03.160]   I'm skeptical, I've long been skeptical of cryptocurrency
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.000]   and things like that.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.460]   I know some of your listeners will disagree with me.
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:07.900]   This part is part of my ignorance of cryptocurrency.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:10.100]   But I'm conservative, lowercase C,
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:11.740]   in the way I think about fiscal issues.
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.500]   I worry about debt.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:16.180]   I'm a believer that there are certain areas
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.820]   where the federal government should play more of a role.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:20.820]   And there are other areas where things should be left
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:21.860]   to the localities.
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:24.760]   And so sometimes that can code me one way or another.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.900]   But I think I sound sometimes a little more left of center
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:28.820]   because on the social issues, I definitely.
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:31.260]   - Well that, because, I mean, there's other explanations,
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.780]   not to be grilling you too hard here.
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:34.060]   - No, it's fair.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:37.420]   - Because you're also an exceptionally respected
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:40.140]   and successful professor in the university system,
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:44.500]   where sometimes there is a lean towards the left.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.540]   And the other aspect is, I think, your viewpoints on Trump,
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:51.700]   where you're a strong critic of Donald Trump.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:52.740]   - Yes, yes.
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:55.020]   - And I guess the question I wanna ask is,
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:58.220]   you as a historian, does that color your perspective
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:11:59.700]   of history?
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:04.700]   Can you, do you ever catch yourself where maybe your
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:08.860]   criticism of Donald Trump might affect how you see
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:09.780]   the Civil War?
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.500]   Like as you were completely diving in
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.580]   and looking at the Civil War,
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.900]   are you able to put aside your sort of the current day
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:20.540]   political viewpoints?
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:21.380]   - No, I'm not.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:24.500]   I think we have to be honest that none of us are objective.
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.980]   We strive to be nonpartisan.
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.420]   I really liked when you said that,
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:29.660]   because I think it's an aspiration.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.580]   No one is objective.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:33.580]   We all have our biases.
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:36.140]   Some people like chocolate, some like vanilla.
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:38.100]   And it's just, that's just the reality, right?
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.740]   And as far as I know, there's really hard,
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:43.420]   it's very hard even to biologically explain that.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:48.260]   And so my view is that what a good historian,
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:50.620]   what a good scholar does, I don't care what the field is,
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:53.120]   is you're self-conscious of your biases.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:59.060]   And you try to recognize them as you're doing your research.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:02.780]   And you make doubly certain that where your research
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:04.740]   seems to reinforce your biases,
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:07.940]   that you actually have the evidence to make that argument.
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:10.180]   But I still believe even doing that,
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.200]   that someone with a slightly different perspective
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.580]   might read the same evidence in different ways.
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:16.620]   That's what makes history vibrant.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:20.500]   So I wrote this book in part, as I say in the introduction,
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:23.340]   because I was self-critical watching Trump
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:26.780]   and the things I quite frankly find deeply dangerous
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.900]   about Donald Trump and about what happened on January 6th.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:32.780]   And I found I had not thought deeply enough
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.380]   about the roots of that in our society.
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:37.380]   Because I don't believe Trump or any one figure
[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:38.840]   creates these kinds of movements.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.820]   They come out of a deeper history.
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:43.100]   - Just a small side tangent.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:46.580]   I do believe your work is non-partisan,
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.180]   but it's also funny that there are a lot of people
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:51.580]   on the right that would read your work
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.260]   and say that you're partisan.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:56.160]   And I think the reason that can happen sometimes,
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.560]   not strongly though, I think you do a really good job,
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.440]   is like the use of certain words also.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:05.620]   I try to be cognizant of that.
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:10.620]   I try not to use words that trigger people's tribalism.
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:12.580]   It's kind of interesting.
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:14.300]   So you have to be also aware of that maybe
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:16.580]   when you're writing history, when you're writing in general.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:18.900]   Is if you're interested in remaining,
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:20.820]   you can put on different hats.
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:24.080]   You can be carefree in just stating your opinion
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.740]   of criticizing Donald Trump or Joe Biden,
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:30.260]   or you can be non-partisan deliberately.
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.340]   And that takes skill probably
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:33.940]   and avoiding certain triggering words.
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:36.700]   - And to me, it's about choosing your battles.
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:40.580]   So I try to write, because I want everyone to read them.
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:42.700]   I actually think people on the left and right
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:43.820]   have a lot to learn from this history.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:45.780]   So many people have said to me around the country,
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.880]   this is history I wish I had known before.
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.500]   But there are moments when I use words
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:52.460]   that I know are controversial,
[02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:55.460]   because I'm trying to show there's a fact base behind them.
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:57.820]   So white supremacy does exist.
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:01.220]   I've had people say, I think that's a politically correct
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:03.420]   term or it's a woke term.
[02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:05.180]   It can be used in the wrong ways.
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.900]   One should not go around calling everything
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.100]   one doesn't like that.
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:11.900]   But the Confederates were white supremacists.
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:13.900]   And I use that word because I think
[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:15.420]   it's an accurate descriptor.
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:18.900]   And we need to recognize that that is a part of our history.
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.660]   But that does trigger some people.
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:23.660]   - Because that language is used to mean
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:25.340]   other things currently.
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.580]   So the press will take on certain terms
[02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:30.580]   like white supremacist and label everybody white supremacist.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:33.460]   A lot of people that basically are on the right
[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:36.860]   or something like that, they use this outraged language
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.520]   and that actually ruins the ability
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:40.860]   to use the language precisely.
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:41.700]   - Exactly.
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.520]   - For historical context.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:43.360]   - That's exactly right.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.200]   That's exactly right.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:46.640]   - But you do have to, unfortunately, we do have to,
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:47.780]   no, actually people disagree.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:51.940]   You might disagree with this, but I tend to try to avoid,
[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:54.740]   like take on the responsibility of avoiding that language.
[02:15:54.740 --> 02:15:57.460]   If the press is using a certain kind of language,
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:15:58.620]   I try to avoid it.
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:01.180]   - Yeah, what I try to do is sometimes avoid it,
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.740]   but where I think the language is necessary.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:03.580]   - Precise, yeah.
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:05.700]   - To be precise, but also to contextualize.
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:11.380]   So I don't call all Confederates white supremacists,
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:13.860]   but I point out where white supremacist ideas
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.860]   have influenced them.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:18.480]   And I point out where certain individuals
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.400]   are doing things that resonate with that.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:24.360]   But I'm against these kind of blanket labels and categories.
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:28.720]   - And you also have to speak about white supremacism
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:31.040]   in that context in a nuanced way.
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:32.400]   So people use white supremacists
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.680]   without thinking what that means,
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.480]   and they just use it as a slow word,
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.500]   like this evil person. - Correct.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:40.160]   - But white supremacist is also just an ideology
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.920]   that a lot of people have believed throughout.
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.200]   Supremacy, whatever, white, black supremacy,
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.280]   whatever supremacy, believing that some people
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:50.720]   are better than others, some group is better than another.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:54.240]   And there's been nations built around these kinds of ideas.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.080]   And a lot of human history is built around those ideas.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:59.680]   It's not just evil people believe in this.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:01.360]   We in the United States of America
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:04.400]   believe this kind of ideology is not productive,
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.680]   it's unethical, but those ideas
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.280]   have been held by a lot of people.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:14.280]   And not like fringe groups, but majorities of nations.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:17.280]   - Right, I'd say the same about antisemitism.
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:20.480]   And there are many people who are not antisemites,
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:23.360]   but don't recognize that they're carrying around
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:27.080]   or promoting antisemitic ideas or antisemitic myths.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:29.120]   - It's a thought that's been held by a lot of people,
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.080]   and you need to be convinced out of it.
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:36.120]   That requires conversation and being empathetic.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.100]   It's not just calling somebody antisemite and you're evil,
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.620]   because if you've ever said something
[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:44.580]   that's kind of a dog whistle against Jewish people,
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:46.340]   you have to be open-hearted to that.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:48.100]   These are ideas that you have to contend with,
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:52.660]   that you have to ultimately, I think,
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:54.820]   heal the division behind those ideas
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.620]   by having empathetic conversations with people,
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:00.180]   as opposed to, again, throwing poop.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:02.220]   I just like saying poop.
[02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:04.660]   All right, ooh, I got a challenge for you.
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:10.620]   Given that you have been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump,
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:12.980]   can you say one thing you like
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:16.100]   and one thing you don't like about Donald Trump?
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.860]   And perhaps can you do the same
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:20.460]   for our current president, Joe Biden?
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:22.380]   One thing you like and one thing you dislike.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:24.420]   - So it's harder for me to do the one thing I dislike,
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:26.420]   'cause there's so many things I dislike.
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:31.080]   But the one thing I like about Donald Trump,
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:38.280]   he believes that America should be a better country.
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:42.460]   I disagree on what he thinks it should be,
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:44.220]   but he's not a declinist.
[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:46.600]   He's someone who believes the world could be made better.
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:48.060]   I disagree with what he's trying to do.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.700]   I disagree with how he's trying to do it,
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.660]   but I like the fact that he thinks it can be better.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:52.900]   His whole argument for himself
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.540]   is that he can make things better.
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:55.780]   I don't think he can,
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.220]   but I think things can be made better.
[02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:58.900]   So I like the second half of that sentence.
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:00.860]   When he says, "I can make things better,"
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:02.640]   take the I out, I like the can be better,
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:05.940]   because there are too many people on the left and the right
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:08.860]   who think that we can't make things better,
[02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:10.180]   we have to accept them as they are,
[02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:12.220]   or they're getting worse.
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.340]   I think a world without hope is horrible,
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.780]   and I think what he has offered his followers
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:17.820]   is a kind of hope.
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:23.620]   - So underneath his message is a kind of optimism
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.460]   for the future of this nation.
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:25.780]   - Yeah, it's a narcissistic optimism,
[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:27.540]   but it's still an optimism, yes.
[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:32.180]   That he's promising that if you elect him again,
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:34.500]   he will make things better.
[02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:36.680]   And I think people need to be told,
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:38.620]   and we need to believe that we can make things better.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:42.500]   So that part I accept, and I reject those who say,
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:43.420]   "We can't make things better."
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:44.860]   My whole historical career is about showing
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:48.020]   that history gives us tools to make things better.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:51.700]   So I like the idea of trying to make things better
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:54.060]   and giving people hope and reason to believe
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.220]   that things can be better.
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.060]   - What's the main thing you dislike about Donald Trump?
[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:03.060]   - I think he has no concern or care for the welfare
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:06.140]   of anyone other than himself.
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.340]   - So assuming, on a basic human psychology perspective.
[02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:13.860]   - And I think he doesn't even care about his children.
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:16.620]   I think he's just, I think it's him.
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:18.100]   I think he's gone into a rabbit hole.
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:19.740]   He might not always have been this way.
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:21.400]   I did watch him a long time in New York City
[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:23.420]   when I was growing up in New York,
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:24.880]   and I think he's been in this path.
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.300]   And I think it's an extreme,
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.300]   it's a clinical kind of narcissism.
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:31.260]   - So do you, when you analyze presidents
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:32.920]   and you've written about presidents,
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:35.020]   you don't just look at policies and so on,
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:35.940]   you look at the human being?
[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:37.420]   - Of course you have to.
[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:38.540]   Leadership is about human being.
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.660]   Policy matters, it's one part of the equation,
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:42.220]   but it's not the only part.
[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:44.340]   - What about Joe Biden?
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.900]   What do you like and what do you dislike about him?
[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:49.980]   - So what I like about Joe Biden is, in contrast to Trump,
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:53.140]   I think Joe Biden really, right now in his career,
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.940]   sees his role as the shepherd of democracy.
[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:58.580]   He really believes that it's his role as president
[02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:02.660]   to make our democracy more stable and more vibrant.
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.980]   I think he really believes,
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:06.580]   I think that's why he's doing what he's doing right now.
[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:09.620]   - And he comes from that system, the political system,
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:12.740]   that basically the process of democracy,
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:14.300]   he's worked there for many decades.
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.140]   - It's all he's done.
[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:16.740]   - Yeah, that's all he knows,
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.700]   and he wants that to propagate for better and for worse.
[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:21.740]   - And he's not an extreme democratic partisan at all.
[02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:24.420]   He's actually a pretty middle of the road guy
[02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:25.780]   on most issues.
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.140]   Some people don't like him for that,
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:30.600]   but I think he is about democracy.
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:32.700]   What do I dislike about Biden?
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:37.700]   I think he does not have the capacity right now
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:42.860]   to provide the language and the public discussion
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.060]   of where our country should go.
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:48.900]   He doesn't have a language to inspire
[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:53.900]   and build enthusiasm for the future.
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:55.940]   - That would probably be one of my,
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:58.180]   I mean, 'cause I'm a sucker for great speeches,
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:01.840]   and so for me, that's definitely a thing that stands out
[02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:04.940]   for several reasons, one in a time,
[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.860]   'cause we've been facing so many challenges,
[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:07.900]   like the pandemic.
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:13.700]   It just seems like, to me, it seems like a easy layup.
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:17.140]   There's so many troubles we're going through
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:19.580]   that just require a great unifying president,
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:23.740]   or the great, like, just if I were to speak candidly
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.700]   about kind of the speaking ability of Obama, for example,
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.360]   Obama would just destroy this right now,
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:34.260]   both on the war in Ukraine, on the pandemic, all of it.
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:37.300]   The unified, there's a hunger for unification, I believe.
[02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:41.020]   Maybe people disagree with that, 'cause they've,
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:42.380]   I think people have become cynical
[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:44.380]   in that the divisions that we're experiencing
[02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:47.220]   are kind of already really baked in.
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:50.020]   They're really planted their feet, but I don't think so.
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:51.500]   I think there's a huge hunger,
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:54.420]   maybe a little bit of a quiet hunger for a unifier,
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:55.860]   for a great unifier.
[02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:58.540]   - I agree, I agree, and I think what a great speech does
[02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:01.700]   is it's like a great piece of music or poetry.
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:03.760]   It helps you see something in yourself
[02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:06.400]   and feel something you didn't feel before.
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.800]   It doesn't overcome all,
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:09.920]   I don't think that speeches are unifying,
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:12.080]   but I think what they are is they're mobilizing,
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.960]   and you can mobilize people to the same mission
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.460]   with different points of view.
[02:23:16.460 --> 02:23:21.560]   - Do you think Trump derangement syndrome
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:23.640]   is a medical condition?
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:26.920]   Also, is there such a thing as Biden derangement syndrome?
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:31.380]   - What I mean by that, it's a funny kind of question,
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:34.980]   but why are people so deeply outraged,
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:39.140]   seemingly beyond reason, at their hatred
[02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:42.280]   or support of Donald Trump, but hatred in particular?
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:45.980]   I've seen a lot of friends and people I respect
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:47.740]   like lose their mind completely.
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:49.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:51.060]   So I'm not sure it's a medical condition,
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.740]   or not because I'm not a medical doctor,
[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:56.620]   so my kids say I'm the wrong kind of doctor.
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:59.160]   I'm a doctor, so let me take you from here.
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:02.160]   No, the fact that you get the doctor's sign
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:04.860]   after getting a PhD is a ridiculous hilarity to me.
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.880]   Hilarious ridiculous.
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:08.180]   - So as the wrong kind of doctor,
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:10.180]   I'm not gonna comment on whether it's a medical condition,
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:12.020]   but I do think you're onto something.
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:17.860]   I think there is a way in which these men
[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:22.020]   become touchstones of anger,
[02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.220]   and there's all kinds of anger and anxiety that people have,
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:28.720]   and I've seen this in other historical periods.
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:31.800]   You center it on one person.
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:36.100]   In a way, that's John Wilkes Booth and Lincoln.
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.660]   He actually didn't have a personal beef with Lincoln.
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:41.180]   It was that all the things he feared
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:46.180]   were manifest in that, and I think that's an old story,
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:49.380]   and then it's made worse by social media
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:52.700]   and the way we're bombarded, and it's like,
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:53.780]   it becomes a drug.
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.540]   I mean, there are people I know who hate Trump or Biden
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:58.900]   so much and just watch them.
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:24:59.740]   It's not that they don't watch them.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:01.060]   It's that they do watch them, right?
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:02.980]   And it's just sort of, and it triggers you,
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:05.700]   and you get hateful, and then you feel
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:08.420]   like you've done something by shouting out your hate
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:10.940]   or typing in, and so I don't know
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:11.980]   if it's a derangement syndrome.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:15.780]   I think it's a way in which our energy gets channeled
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:18.900]   and expressed in totally useless ways.
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:21.140]   - Yeah, that's an interesting psychology,
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:23.120]   which reminds me, I need to explore that,
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:25.580]   because I've noticed that, believe it or not,
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.540]   it's easy for me to believe, but there's people
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:31.260]   watching this right now who really hate me,
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:33.100]   and they're watching because they hate me.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.680]   They hate the way I look, the way I speak,
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:39.280]   the mumbling, all of that, and they're still watching,
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:43.980]   and I'd like to say that, as I nervously
[02:25:43.980 --> 02:25:46.220]   try to explain myself, I'd like to say
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:47.700]   that that's not a productive way.
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:48.540]   I get it.
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:52.380]   I understand, there's a kind of,
[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:54.940]   'cause I, what is it?
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:56.980]   Is it the same psychological effect
[02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:58.860]   when you see a car crash and you keep staring?
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:25:59.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's some kind
[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:01.260]   of thing that pulls you in. - Totally.
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:04.020]   - But I feel like it's that feeling,
[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:05.980]   well, it's probably slightly different,
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:09.700]   but you kind of want to, you want to maybe feel something,
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:11.140]   and there's an anger in you already,
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:13.780]   frustration from day-to-day life, life is hard,
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:16.220]   and you just wanna channel that anger towards something,
[02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:18.420]   but I just, the internet really makes that easy
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:19.260]   for some reason.
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.440]   - And it makes sense of your life, that's the problem.
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.740]   For people whose lives are chaos,
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:26.900]   hating you and blaming you gives order to their lives.
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:29.260]   - Yeah, if it makes you happy, please continue.
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:30.220]   (laughing)
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:32.020]   - Well, I'm curious, it seems to bother you, though,
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:32.840]   doesn't it?
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:34.780]   - Yeah, hate of any kind, not towards me,
[02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:37.180]   just the people, 'cause I think about them,
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:39.660]   and I tend to think that most people
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:41.980]   are amazing human beings and have a capacity
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.580]   to do great things in this world,
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:47.740]   and so I just think that's not a productive way of being.
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:50.700]   Like, psychologically, for anything whatsoever,
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:52.840]   everybody has quirks that you can hate,
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:54.840]   but you just focus on the really positive stuff,
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:56.720]   and you celebrate that stuff, and that feels good,
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.120]   that has a momentum to it.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.240]   I guess the hate has a momentum to it, too,
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:02.800]   and that's what I'm trying to highlight.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.680]   If you follow the momentum of hate,
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:07.640]   that's going to maybe feel good in the short term,
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.720]   but it's not, it's gonna fuck you over
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:11.160]   more and more in your life,
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:12.960]   and you have to be cognizant of that
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.000]   as you interact with the internet.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.160]   - I agree with everything you said,
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.760]   but I think people who do things
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.060]   that are influential and serious,
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:23.260]   there always are some people who hate them.
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:25.740]   - I suppose that, but I wanted to show the difference
[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:30.060]   between philosophical disagreement that borders on hate
[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:33.300]   and what's called hate watching,
[02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:36.500]   where you just, which is what I would say TDS is,
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:39.380]   which is you're almost enjoying
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:40.700]   how much you hate this person,
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:41.820]   and you're just sitting in their hate,
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:45.020]   and you forgot, you lose all reason, you lose everything,
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:47.280]   your capacity to think as an individual,
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:50.180]   to empathize with others, you lose all of that.
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:52.780]   You're in this muck of hate,
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:56.260]   and somehow it helps you make sense
[02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:58.760]   of this particular difficult moment in your life,
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:00.740]   but otherwise, it just,
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:02.720]   it seems like a shitty way to live.
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:05.200]   But disagreement, definitely, I like disagreement.
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:06.460]   - But I guess what I'm saying is,
[02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:08.940]   and I think this is your message, too, right,
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:12.900]   is that don't let the fact that people don't like you
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:14.200]   or even that some people hate you
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:16.020]   stop you from doing the right thing.
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.820]   Think about how you can perhaps trigger them less,
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:20.180]   but don't stop what you're doing.
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:22.940]   I see too many, and this is why I bring this up,
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:24.300]   too many of my students,
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:26.820]   too many young, very talented people
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:29.500]   who are afraid to take risks
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:31.860]   because they're afraid that someone will hate them,
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:33.940]   and that can't get in your way.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:36.420]   - The reality is most people,
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:38.580]   or there will always be at least one person
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:42.900]   that will have your back, and that will support you,
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:44.460]   and you just focus on them,
[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:46.220]   as long as you're doing the right thing,
[02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:48.140]   focus on them for the strength.
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:50.860]   But in general, I'm exaggerating here,
[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:52.380]   because most of the time,
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:55.180]   99% of people are supportive on the internet.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:58.380]   It's just that something about the human psychology
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:00.740]   really stands out to you when somebody criticizes.
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:02.220]   - Well, it's easy on the internet.
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:04.420]   This is historically different from where we were before,
[02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:05.580]   and it's a society.
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.020]   It's very easy now to say hurtful things to people
[02:29:08.020 --> 02:29:09.820]   and not have to even deal with them
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:11.140]   looking at you in the face.
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:14.180]   One of the things that encourages politeness
[02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:16.700]   is the fact that we're looking at one another,
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:19.540]   and we are naturally programmed
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:23.980]   not to want the other person to react to us in certain ways,
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:26.100]   but when we don't see their face,
[02:29:26.100 --> 02:29:28.300]   it's very easy to say all kinds of things.
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.380]   - Let me actually comment on that point.
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:31.980]   There's a lot of people on the internet
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:36.060]   that say that I don't push back on points
[02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:38.820]   or criticize people or ask the hard questions enough.
[02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:42.060]   First of all, oftentimes I disagree with that assessment,
[02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:46.020]   but also I don't think you guys realize how hard that is
[02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:48.380]   to do when you're sitting with a person.
[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:49.620]   I don't care about access.
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:51.020]   I don't care about them being famous.
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:52.340]   Just on a basic human level,
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:55.620]   it's really hard to ask a hard question
[02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:56.460]   from a place of empathy.
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:57.360]   - Except when I'm sitting here.
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:29:58.500]   You seem to be able to ask me hard.
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:29:59.860]   - No, this is a super fun,
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:01.340]   I mean, when there's brilliant people like you
[02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.980]   where there's nothing to push back on, that's easy,
[02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:07.780]   but there's a basic human thing that doesn't,
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:09.540]   I think it's almost easier to be a journalist.
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:11.020]   Like journalists do this well
[02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:13.700]   where they don't have empathy for the person.
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:16.120]   They're just asking the hard questions.
[02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:19.460]   So where were you at this time last night?
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:21.000]   Because that's very suspicious.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.940]   It's in contradiction to what you said,
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:24.740]   and they're just doing factual stuff.
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:27.580]   And if you actually truly have a conversation
[02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:30.460]   with another human being you empathize, it's very difficult
[02:30:30.460 --> 02:30:32.660]   because they have a story.
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:34.740]   They have a vision of themselves
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.300]   that they're the good person.
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:40.140]   And to call somebody a liar while having empathy
[02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:43.980]   basically imply that they're a liar, that's damn, damn hard.
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:45.700]   So anyway, but I'm-
[02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:47.380]   - Well said, I agree.
[02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:49.100]   - Trying to figure this thing out.
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.340]   Can you make the case that the January 6th storming
[02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:54.140]   of the US Capitol is a big deal?
[02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:57.500]   And can you make the case that it is not a big deal?
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:00.340]   - I think the case is overwhelming that it was a big deal.
[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:01.620]   And I opened the book with this
[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:04.100]   before going back to the end of the Civil War
[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:06.500]   because I think it echoes that moment.
[02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:11.500]   You had a group of people who literally tried to stop
[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:16.740]   the peaceful transfer of power and were intending,
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:19.260]   and there's overwhelming evidence of this,
[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:21.580]   if they had caught the vice president
[02:31:21.580 --> 02:31:25.500]   or the speaker of the house to do bodily harm to them
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:27.460]   or to kidnap them.
[02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:29.180]   So this was a coup d'etat.
[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.420]   That is the definition of a coup d'etat
[02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:33.460]   when you try to capture and prevent elected officials
[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:34.740]   from doing their job.
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:36.000]   That's a huge deal.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.980]   That had happened before in our country in states.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:41.300]   I talk about this in Louisiana, in Tennessee,
[02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.260]   in places like that after the Civil War,
[02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:44.660]   but it never happened in the Capitol.
[02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:45.740]   That's a huge deal.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:47.820]   That is, if I might say, that's like third,
[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:50.220]   what we would think of as third world behavior
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:51.060]   in our society.
[02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:52.980]   And no offense to those from other parts of the world.
[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:53.980]   I'm just trying to make a point
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:56.740]   as how we see that as happening somewhere else, not here.
[02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.040]   That's a big fucking deal.
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:01.620]   The case that it's not a big deal,
[02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:04.760]   I guess the case to make there is that they didn't succeed.
[02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:06.140]   The case that it's not a big deal
[02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:08.040]   is not that their intentions were not bad.
[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:11.160]   I don't see how you can defend their intentions.
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:13.340]   The case that it's not a big deal
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:15.540]   is that they're a bunch of clowns.
[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:19.100]   And yeah, they broke in, but in the end,
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:20.420]   once they got in there, they didn't know what to do,
[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:21.860]   which is true.
[02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:26.100]   And so, I think a professional coup plotter
[02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:28.220]   would say these were the amateurs
[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:30.460]   and that they had no real chance of succeeding
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:33.020]   because once they got into the Capitol,
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:34.420]   they had no plan what to do next.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.260]   What were they gonna do?
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:39.220]   You know, steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office.
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:40.300]   They didn't seem to have a plan.
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:43.520]   And then what ended up happening, they left the building.
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:46.360]   - Well, that would be the case that it's not a big deal
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:50.220]   because their intention was not to overthrow.
[02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.540]   Their intention was to protest
[02:32:52.540 --> 02:32:54.180]   because if the intention was to overthrow,
[02:32:54.180 --> 02:32:55.220]   it would be much more organized.
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:56.900]   - I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming
[02:32:56.900 --> 02:32:58.260]   that they intended to stop.
[02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:00.860]   They were there to stop the certification of the election.
[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:03.060]   They were there to prevent Donald Trump
[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:04.660]   from having to leave office.
[02:33:04.660 --> 02:33:06.300]   They just didn't have a good plan.
[02:33:06.300 --> 02:33:08.700]   This was the keystone cops.
[02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:10.740]   - So, you're saying there is some,
[02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:12.900]   like statistically some possibility
[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:15.460]   that this would have succeeded
[02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:17.820]   at halting the basic process of democracy.
[02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:19.420]   - You could imagine a scenario where it might have
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:20.980]   if they had gotten lucky, sure.
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:23.540]   If they had caught the vice president.
[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:25.900]   - But what could have, if they caught the vice president-
[02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:27.340]   - They couldn't go on and certify then.
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:28.180]   He has to be there.
[02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:30.100]   - No, but don't you think that would resolve itself
[02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:32.100]   through police action and so on?
[02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:36.500]   My question is how much is this individual hooligans
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:39.220]   and how much of this is a gigantic movement
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:41.620]   that's challenging the very fabric of our democracy?
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:43.420]   - Well, it's not a gigantic movement,
[02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:45.180]   but it was a small coup d'etat
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:47.300]   that could have actually made the transition
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:48.140]   much more difficult.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:49.260]   Was there a scenario where Donald Trump
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:50.740]   stayed in office legitimately?
[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:51.580]   No.
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:53.240]   But was there a scenario where they created
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:56.020]   a great deal of chaos that further undermined
[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:56.860]   our democracy?
[02:33:56.860 --> 02:33:57.700]   Absolutely, yes.
[02:33:57.700 --> 02:33:58.860]   Here's how it would happen, right?
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:00.780]   They capture Pence, right?
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.100]   They either kidnap him and try to ransom him,
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.860]   or they, which is what they were trying to do
[02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:08.300]   with the Michigan governor, Governor Whitmer,
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:09.740]   or they kill him.
[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:11.460]   And then Donald Trump says, "Okay, well,
[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:13.980]   there's no vice president, so you can't certify."
[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:16.220]   The Senate would choose someone else to be vice president,
[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:18.060]   but Donald Trump says, "No, that's not legitimate."
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:19.580]   - Do you think it's possible that Donald Trump
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:20.420]   would say something like that?
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:22.020]   - Absolutely.
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:22.900]   - I disagree with you.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.780]   - He said that morning that Pence should not certify.
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:27.860]   He said that morning.
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:30.620]   - But there's a difference between sort of Twitter rhetoric.
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:32.100]   - No, no, he said it at a rally.
[02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:33.820]   - Sure, rally rhetoric.
[02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:35.980]   And there is a threshold.
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:37.460]   It feels like a big leap.
[02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:40.340]   - He asked people around him in the Oval Office
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:41.380]   how he could make that happen.
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:44.500]   He tried to get a new person appointed attorney general
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:45.540]   who would do that.
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:48.340]   He tried to find legal justification for it.
[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:51.340]   I think the evidence is overwhelming
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:53.740]   that Trump was supportive of efforts
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:57.160]   after the election didn't go the way he wanted
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:34:59.060]   to keep him in office.
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:02.420]   And whether that's legally actionable
[02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:05.300]   and whether one thinks that means he's a bad president
[02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:09.900]   or not is a matter of opinion, but facts are facts.
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:11.580]   - Yeah, I just wonder if it's possible
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:14.500]   for him to have stayed president in this kind of context.
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:16.340]   To me, it seems like a heated, just like you said,
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:19.020]   elections can even be violent.
[02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:20.180]   They're heated.
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:21.980]   People are very upset.
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:25.340]   When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016,
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:27.180]   I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:30.140]   The amount of anger,
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:35.700]   I was just, the energy I was getting from people.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:39.860]   I mean, if there was any way to channel that anger,
[02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:41.220]   I think people would be in trouble.
[02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:42.580]   - But let's just-- - There's anger.
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:44.300]   - Yeah, I agree with that, and that is right.
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:46.460]   And elections are violent, as I said.
[02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:47.800]   But this is different.
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.940]   This is the person in the office of the presidency
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:56.140]   using the power of the presidency to try to stay in office,
[02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:59.660]   to imperil people's lives, to distort our government
[02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:01.940]   on a scale we had not seen before.
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:04.060]   And these are not opinions of mine.
[02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:05.900]   We have the documentary evidence.
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:08.300]   We have the testimony from people about this.
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:10.140]   We can differ over what you think
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:12.240]   of his presidency as a whole.
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:13.660]   We can differ over whether you think
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.220]   he should be held legally responsible.
[02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:16.780]   Those are matters of opinion.
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:21.780]   But the facts are he sat on January 6th, watched it on TV,
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:25.500]   did not send ever, ever.
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:27.860]   Did he ever send any protection for Congress?
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:28.760]   That is his job.
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:32.540]   And throughout, asked, continued to ask
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:36.300]   how this certification could be prevented.
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.940]   - To you, that's not incompetence, that's malevolence.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:39.780]   - Absolutely.
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:44.380]   If I watch my children getting harmed
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:47.260]   and I don't do something about it, I'm watching it.
[02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:51.300]   And in fact, I take action that tries to help those
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:53.820]   who are doing the harm, you would not just say
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:54.740]   I'm an incompetent president.
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:56.980]   You would, a parent, you would say I was a negligent parent
[02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:59.820]   and you'd call parental support to take away my children.
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:03.300]   - I was troubled by the way the press covered it,
[02:37:03.300 --> 02:37:05.700]   that they politicized the crap out of that.
[02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:10.860]   And not just the press, but also Congress itself.
[02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:13.300]   It just seemed like impeachment and all of this,
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:15.260]   there just seemed to be a kind of circus
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:20.260]   that wasn't interested in democracy or non-partisanship.
[02:37:21.860 --> 02:37:26.220]   I don't, so it's very difficult for me to see the situation
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:29.660]   with clear eyes because it's been colored by the press.
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:32.440]   It's very difficult for me to know what is even true.
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:35.580]   - Members of Congress, including our members of Congress
[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:38.060]   from our district and others, right?
[02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.380]   Their lives were threatened.
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:41.700]   They were traumatized.
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:44.840]   I have a lot of students, at least a dozen
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:48.620]   who are staff members, more than half are Republicans.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:54.020]   Part of what traumatized them was that the president
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:56.140]   did not do his job to protect them.
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:37:58.540]   Yes, as a child would be traumatized,
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:00.980]   not only if harmed by someone,
[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:03.380]   but if mom and dad don't do everything they can.
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:04.900]   One of the things that makes people feel safe
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:05.900]   is they know their parents,
[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:07.700]   they know their person in authority
[02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:08.740]   can't always keep them safe,
[02:38:08.740 --> 02:38:10.620]   but they want to know the person's always trying.
[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:12.260]   - I agree with you that there, listen,
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:16.500]   I'm somebody that believes in this kind of idea of family,
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:17.540]   especially people I work with,
[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:20.540]   that to me is a high ideal to protect.
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:22.380]   But that's a little bit different.
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:23.660]   - It's his job.
[02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.500]   - Hold on a second.
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:26.500]   That's a little bit different than protecting democracy.
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:27.800]   Those are two different things.
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.300]   Protecting your employees and protecting democracy
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.380]   is an ideal.
[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:34.860]   You could say he didn't protect either,
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:37.300]   but I think the criticism that he didn't protect
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:38.300]   the employees is one thing.
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:40.020]   - But the employees in this case
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:42.020]   are the ones carrying out democracy.
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:43.500]   So it's like saying the general
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:45.620]   who doesn't protect his soldiers
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:47.100]   is maybe not protecting his employees.
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:49.580]   He's also not protecting the war effort, right?
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.580]   It is his, the people we're talking about
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:52.660]   are the people who are actually doing
[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:53.980]   the work of democracy at that moment,
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:55.940]   the most basic function of democracy,
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:58.180]   which is certifying votes.
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:00.500]   And their lives with, I'm telling you,
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:04.260]   I had students, one who works for Senator Romney,
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:08.060]   for example, who spent hours in a closet
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:11.580]   hearing people outside, looking on her phone,
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:14.580]   when is the president sending people to protect us
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:15.860]   so we can do our job?
[02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:17.820]   And she was not happy with the way the election turned out,
[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.700]   but she was there to do her job
[02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:21.700]   because she believes in democracy
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:23.500]   to serve as the Senate in the Senate's role.
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:25.460]   - What should have Donald Trump done
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:27.420]   without turning him into a different human being?
[02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:28.860]   - He should have immediately,
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:32.340]   just as we were watching things get breached,
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:34.060]   the moment they had, that the members of the House
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:37.820]   and the Senate had to evacuate their respective chambers,
[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:40.900]   he should have immediately gone on TV and Twitter
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:45.220]   and every space he could and tell his supporters to leave
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:47.340]   and say what he never said.
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:49.220]   This is un-American what you're doing.
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:50.260]   This is unacceptable.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:51.100]   Never use those words.
[02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:52.700]   This is un-American, this is unacceptable.
[02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:56.420]   I'm completely against anyone storming the Capitol like this.
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:57.780]   Go home now, please.
[02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.940]   - Or you can use his own language, but tell him to leave.
[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:01.580]   - Yeah, and immediately, as soon as,
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:03.860]   we know he was watching for hours
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:06.700]   and we have testimony from his own daughter, from Ivanka,
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:08.340]   saying she tried time and again
[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:10.820]   to get him to say something earlier on, and he didn't.
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:12.540]   He watched it.
[02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:15.740]   He can still criticize all the politicians.
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:16.980]   He can criticize everyone he wants,
[02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:17.980]   but he should have told him to leave.
[02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:20.820]   - All he has to do in that moment is basic,
[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:24.060]   protecting democracy, protecting the Capitol, leave.
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:25.740]   Tell them to leave and do everything he can
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:27.140]   to find any kind of force he can give
[02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:28.780]   to go protect the Capitol.
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:31.700]   - I wonder how difficult it is
[02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:33.740]   to lose a presidential election.
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:35.980]   - It's happened so many times.
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:36.820]   We know.
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:37.900]   - I understand that, but it's,
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:41.420]   especially when like, what is it?
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:44.060]   You know, 80 million people vote for you,
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:46.700]   or like some, like millions and millions and millions
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:47.540]   of people vote for you.
[02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:48.740]   It's crazy.
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:49.580]   It's crazy.
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:50.900]   This democracy thing is crazy.
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:55.380]   - George H.W. Bush won a war in the Middle East, right?
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:56.980]   He had 90% approval rating,
[02:40:56.980 --> 02:40:58.940]   and then a year later lost the election
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:00.940]   to someone, Bill Clinton, he thought,
[02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:02.540]   had none of the experience he had.
[02:41:02.540 --> 02:41:03.380]   Someone didn't have,
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.580]   he believed didn't have the right moral character.
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:08.860]   And Bush did everything he could
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:10.620]   to help the next president get started well,
[02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:12.700]   and they became good friends.
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:16.100]   George W. Bush, he didn't love Obama.
[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:18.980]   That's considered one of the smoothest transitions.
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:21.980]   George W. Bush ordered every single person
[02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:24.820]   in his administration to do everything they could
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:25.820]   to help the new admin.
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:27.540]   That's what a leader does.
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:30.540]   - Yeah, humility is one of the things I admire in leaders.
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:34.260]   Well, that felt heated.
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:38.620]   Speaking of which, can you just linger on,
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:41.260]   how do you think we can heal the divide in this country?
[02:41:41.260 --> 02:41:42.100]   Do you think it's possible?
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:44.180]   There feels to be a strong division.
[02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:45.380]   - I think we can heal the divide.
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:47.540]   I think, as you said,
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:49.420]   there's so many opportunities with new technology
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:50.740]   to bring people together,
[02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:52.840]   just as we're using it to tear them apart.
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:56.140]   I have the best job in the world
[02:41:56.140 --> 02:41:59.180]   because I get to teach so many students.
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:01.700]   I'll have 300 in my class in the spring,
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:03.580]   in my US history class.
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:05.060]   And what I've found with my students
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:08.180]   is they're mostly not Democrats or Republicans.
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:09.780]   They mostly care about the same things.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:12.900]   Every one of my students seems to care about climate change.
[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:14.580]   - Oh, I thought you were gonna say TikTok, but okay.
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:15.420]   - Yeah, I would take that.
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:17.980]   - Second to that, climate change.
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:19.760]   - You know, and I think they,
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:24.780]   I think they offer a new future for us.
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:26.460]   And here's what I'll say as a historian.
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:28.460]   We go through cycles of division
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.660]   and cycles of less division, less partisanship.
[02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:34.140]   One moment when it seems people agree too much
[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.980]   on the mainstream encourages people to go to the extremes.
[02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:38.300]   When people see the extremes,
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:40.220]   they wanna come back to the middle.
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:41.660]   And that is where my students are.
[02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:45.740]   Most of my students want lower inflation.
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:47.340]   They agree with Republicans on that,
[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:49.660]   but they want more to be done about climate change.
[02:42:49.660 --> 02:42:51.060]   They're in the middle on these issues.
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:53.980]   And I think giving them more opportunity.
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:57.820]   So what's the best way to heal our divisions, honestly?
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:43:01.140]   Get the old men out and the young women and men in.
[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:03.260]   - Because they ultimately don't have that same division
[02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:05.100]   in their like deeply baked in.
[02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.060]   Not only that, they find it disgusting
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:09.340]   in the way you and I do.
[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:11.020]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:13.460]   What's the right way to have conversations?
[02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:15.740]   I mean, just to stay on that
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:17.640]   with people on the left and the right.
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:21.260]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know how often you practice this.
[02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:22.180]   You care about politics.
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:25.460]   How often do you talk to people who voted for Trump
[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:27.300]   or who are Republicans?
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:28.860]   - I try, but it's hard.
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:32.140]   75% of people I talk to are not those people.
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:33.900]   - Do you have people who are Trump supporters
[02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:35.180]   in your extended family?
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:38.420]   Thanksgiving?
[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:39.900]   - No, I don't in my extended family.
[02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:41.360]   - Are they no longer?
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:42.540]   (laughing)
[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:43.700]   - No longer in my family.
[02:43:43.700 --> 02:43:45.740]   (laughing)
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:47.420]   - It's a fashion.
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.900]   I have taken them out of the photograph.
[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:49.740]   - They do not exist.
[02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:50.860]   You just erase, yeah.
[02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:54.900]   - I do, but I know I have friends who fall into that,
[02:43:54.900 --> 02:43:57.020]   but it's still a minority of my friend group.
[02:43:57.020 --> 02:44:00.660]   So I wanna be clear that I'm not as good at this as I should.
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:02.220]   But I think we do have to reach out.
[02:44:02.220 --> 02:44:05.860]   But I also, I'm less interested, honestly,
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:10.860]   in refighting old battles with old dogs.
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:14.020]   I'm more interested in finding ways
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:18.860]   to get a new crop of people educated and involved
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:23.860]   and engaged without imparting the same partisanship on them.
[02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:28.220]   So I will support, and this I have to,
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:29.660]   I will support and encourage,
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:31.300]   especially any student of mine,
[02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:34.700]   but any young person who is smart, has good ideas,
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:35.540]   I don't care whether,
[02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:37.340]   I don't ask whether they're a Democrat or Republican.
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:39.140]   And I have given money to some young candidates
[02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:40.260]   who are not Democrats.
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.120]   So that's the way.
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.020]   I think it's a generational change.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:49.660]   And I think it's reaching out and trying to get people
[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:52.280]   to see beyond partisan divisions
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:54.500]   who are in their 20s and teens rather than,
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.020]   that's why we do our podcast,
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:58.780]   this is Democracy, Zachary and I do that, my son and I,
[02:44:58.780 --> 02:44:59.860]   because we're exactly that.
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:01.140]   You will never hear an episode
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:03.080]   where we take one side or another.
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:05.260]   Our goal is to explain the issue,
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:09.420]   whether it's the challenges of democracy in China,
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:13.100]   or it's climate change, or whatever it is,
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:16.380]   or it's memory of war in our society,
[02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:17.580]   and to explain the issue
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:19.460]   and then offer people an optimistic pathway
[02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:21.300]   that's neither one side nor the other.
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:23.860]   - So actually, to push back a little bit on young people,
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:28.420]   I do see that, the exhaustion with the partisanship.
[02:45:28.420 --> 02:45:30.700]   But I've also, and this I think is the case
[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:32.700]   throughout history, and I see it now,
[02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:35.460]   especially in the teenage years,
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:37.540]   especially if I'm being honest with boys,
[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:42.740]   there's a desire for extremism in various directions,
[02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:44.260]   all kinds of extremism.
[02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:48.180]   Like just extreme awesomeness or extreme anything,
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:52.820]   just extreme, and F the man that tries to make me behave,
[02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:53.900]   this kind of energy.
[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:56.460]   And that's why you can take any ideology,
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:57.940]   basically any extreme ideology,
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:45:58.780]   it starts being exciting,
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:00.860]   whether you're a Marxist or a communist,
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:04.020]   you're not just gonna be like for socialized healthcare.
[02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:06.260]   You're gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:09.020]   Let's go full hammer and sickle.
[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:11.060]   I'm gonna wear red.
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:13.500]   And then the same with white supremacy
[02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:18.500]   or just red pill, the way you see society,
[02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:21.860]   the way you see the world, the extremism is there.
[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:24.700]   And part of that, it's kind of,
[02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:26.020]   to steel map that perspective,
[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:29.340]   it can be productive, that energy, if it's controlled.
[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:31.740]   And especially if we have institutions
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:34.340]   that keep it a little under control.
[02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:38.020]   One of the criticisms I have, a lot of people have,
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:41.620]   I'm actually much more moderate than that criticism
[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:43.820]   of universities is they give a little too much power
[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:45.780]   to the 18-year-old who just showed up
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:48.100]   with their Marxist books and so on,
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:49.740]   and they wanna burn the whole thing down.
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:53.340]   That's beautiful, but the whole process of the universities
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:57.100]   get different viewpoints, educate more,
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:47:00.460]   make that person's viewpoint more sophisticated,
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:02.740]   complex, nuanced, and all that kind of thing.
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:03.620]   - I think you're right,
[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:06.060]   but I think that's more talk than action.
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:10.080]   In my experience, there is, especially among young men,
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:11.000]   you're absolutely right,
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.780]   there is a valorization of the tough guy.
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:18.640]   Because most men 18 and 19 are still not fully comfortable
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:21.300]   in their masculinity, however they're going to define it.
[02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:24.900]   And so a way of performing that
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:27.060]   is being extreme in one way or another.
[02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:29.180]   And I've definitely seen that,
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:32.700]   but I think it's more often than not rhetoric.
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:36.280]   And actually, there's a very strong power
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:39.340]   of peer pressure and conformity that works on young people.
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:41.580]   And the positive side of that now
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:43.820]   is the peer pressure among them
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.680]   is not to join one party or the other.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.620]   It's to say, "This is terrible.
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:50.260]   "Look at how our parents are screwing things up."
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:51.900]   And they're right.
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:53.980]   And I think we can lean into that
[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:57.900]   and get a lot of positive creative action out of that.
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:00.100]   On universities, you brought this up a few times,
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:01.900]   and I think we have to be careful.
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:03.540]   I think you and I agree on this.
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:05.740]   It's not that universities are free of bias,
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:07.680]   but universities, especially large universities,
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:11.860]   whether it's UT, MIT, Yale, whatever we're talking about,
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:13.580]   they're large, complex empires.
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:18.300]   And most universities, people in the arts,
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:19.420]   tend to be a little left of center.
[02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:20.980]   It's self-selection.
[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:23.940]   Those in engineering tend to be pretty much in the middle,
[02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:27.060]   and those at business schools tend to be right of center.
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:31.440]   And so I think we need to be careful not to generalize.
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.040]   At the University of Texas, there's as much influence
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:36.600]   from the business school and the athletic department
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:38.380]   as there is from the humanities.
[02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:41.180]   So it's not a left-leaning campus.
[02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:43.220]   And that's also true at Yale.
[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:44.700]   You have the School of Management at Yale.
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:47.860]   You have a huge medical school, right?
[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:49.780]   People who are very professional
[02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:51.620]   and less political on a lot of these issues.
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:53.340]   So I think we have to be careful.
[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:55.780]   I think there's certain pockets of things,
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:57.820]   but some of that you're never going to avoid, right?
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:01.060]   Engineers are always gonna be the people who--
[02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:02.820]   - Hey, now, easy now.
[02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:06.340]   - I'm sure you've heard, who want to generally find
[02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:09.260]   some objective measure and avoid political interpretation.
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:11.140]   They wanna find their objective measure.
[02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:14.220]   - I'm surprised how most people in robotics don't seem to,
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:15.140]   they're afraid of humans.
[02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:15.980]   They run away from humans.
[02:49:15.980 --> 02:49:17.940]   - Precisely, precisely.
[02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:20.820]   And the arts people are always gonna be more touchy-feely,
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:22.540]   and the business people are always gonna like markets.
[02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:23.380]   I mean--
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:26.740]   - And my own personal opinion on this is,
[02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:28.300]   this is just me talking.
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:31.540]   I don't know if it's grounded in data,
[02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:35.160]   but just my own experiences, it seems a lot of the things
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:36.940]   that people criticize about universities
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:39.420]   comes from administrations, from the bureaucracies.
[02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:42.980]   The faculty and the students are, even with biases,
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:44.940]   are really interesting people.
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:47.620]   And all of their different, I wouldn't call them biases,
[02:49:47.620 --> 02:49:50.740]   but the different perspectives add to the conversation.
[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:53.500]   It's the, too much, of course you need,
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:55.700]   just like with institutions, you need some.
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:58.420]   But too much, it becomes too heavy-handed.
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:03.260]   And somehow, that has been getting a little bit out of hand
[02:50:03.260 --> 02:50:06.220]   at a bunch of universities, just too much administration.
[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:07.580]   And I don't know what the mechanism is
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:09.500]   to make it more efficient,
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:10.780]   but that's been always the struggle.
[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:13.140]   Maybe the public criticism is the very mechanism
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:16.220]   that makes universities, the administration smaller.
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:17.820]   - Absolutely, we have those issues,
[02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:20.540]   and you can also say athletics has gotten out of control.
[02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:21.380]   - Sure, yeah.
[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:25.100]   Like you said, you co-host a podcast
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:28.380]   with your son, Zachary, called "This is Democracy."
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:31.340]   What's been, that's a million questions I can ask,
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:35.260]   but just that pops to memory, what's been a challenging
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:38.360]   or maybe an eye-opening conversation you've had on it?
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:41.200]   - Oh, we've had a lot of eye-opening conversations.
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:46.200]   Our most recent episode is an episode on the German right.
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:50.420]   As I'm sure many of your listeners know,
[02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:52.620]   there was a group called the Reichsbürger,
[02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.140]   I think they still exist in Germany,
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.180]   they were actually led by a former German prince.
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:00.860]   And they had been planning to assassinate
[02:51:00.860 --> 02:51:03.780]   the Bundeskanzler and were organizing
[02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:04.860]   all sorts of other efforts.
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:08.660]   They do not believe that the current German government
[02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:10.700]   is legitimate, they think the last legitimate government
[02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:11.560]   was the Nazi government.
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:13.620]   They see the whole post-war period as illegitimate.
[02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:14.820]   - So it's the German far right.
[02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:15.660]   - Correct.
[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:19.500]   And we had on a member of the German Bundestag,
[02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:21.620]   of their parliament, who's been involved
[02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:23.460]   in the investigations or in the oversight
[02:51:23.460 --> 02:51:26.900]   of the investigations, and talking with her
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:29.420]   about the depth of these issues
[02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:31.200]   and the challenges they face in Germany.
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:34.080]   It's certainly not a huge part of German society,
[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:35.960]   but it's a significant number of people,
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:39.100]   probably more than 20,000 people who are part of this.
[02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:43.220]   To me brought home how much of what we thought
[02:51:43.220 --> 02:51:45.620]   was the past is still in the present.
[02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:48.660]   And I think that's a recurring theme in our show.
[02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:50.060]   And our show is optimistic,
[02:51:50.060 --> 02:51:52.760]   which is not about woes to the world.
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:54.300]   It's actually about taking issues,
[02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:56.260]   we take a topic each week that's in the news,
[02:51:56.260 --> 02:51:58.400]   we go back to understand the history,
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:00.540]   and we then use that history to make better policy,
[02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:02.700]   to talk about how to make better policy today.
[02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:06.620]   And in this case, it was clear that even in Germany,
[02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:10.580]   there's a lot of unfinished work in explaining to people
[02:52:10.580 --> 02:52:13.020]   and helping those, for instance, in the former East,
[02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:16.200]   where a lot of this group has its support,
[02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:17.780]   why this government is legitimate,
[02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:19.260]   why it operates the way it does,
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:20.480]   and addressing their concerns.
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:23.220]   It was strikingly similar to some of the problems
[02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:24.340]   we have in our own society.
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:26.260]   - Yeah, it's interesting that there's a far right movement
[02:52:26.260 --> 02:52:27.100]   in Germany.
[02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:28.860]   So you look at different parts of the world as well,
[02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:29.820]   not just the United States.
[02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:33.100]   - We do, we did an episode recently on China,
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:36.700]   on the effects of zero COVID and the protests in China.
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:39.140]   We've done a number of episodes on the war in Ukraine.
[02:52:39.140 --> 02:52:43.460]   Our role each week is to have on either a policymaker,
[02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:46.220]   a scholar, or an activist who can help us
[02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:48.940]   understand an issue and get beyond partisanship.
[02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:50.860]   So what's been eye-opening are some of the details,
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.780]   but what's also been eye-opening, honestly,
[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:55.680]   is how easy it is to have a non-partisan conversation.
[02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:57.380]   It's not hard.
[02:52:57.380 --> 02:53:00.900]   We open every episode with a poem that Zachary writes.
[02:53:00.900 --> 02:53:02.940]   He writes an original poem, "I'll Brag on My Son."
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:05.780]   He's the youth poet laureate in Austin right now,
[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:08.180]   and he writes a poem on each topic.
[02:53:08.180 --> 02:53:10.060]   - What's the style of poetry usually?
[02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:11.380]   Is he dark, is he--
[02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:14.380]   - No, he's usually, he's often ironic.
[02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:15.980]   - Ironic, like with a bit of humor?
[02:53:15.980 --> 02:53:16.820]   - Yes.
[02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:17.640]   - Okay.
[02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:18.480]   - And he likes word plays.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:21.340]   - So he's not like a rebellious, dark teenager
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:22.860]   that's just-- - No.
[02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:24.460]   He's a creative know-it-all.
[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:28.580]   - Strong words, he would probably disagree.
[02:53:28.580 --> 02:53:29.420]   - But what's interesting--
[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.140]   - Sounds like you're the know-it-all on the podcast.
[02:53:31.140 --> 02:53:32.460]   - Oh no, oh no.
[02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:35.060]   We do have a lot of followers,
[02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:36.980]   and most of them comment on him, they don't comment on me.
[02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:38.620]   So I'm the junior partner.
[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:40.620]   - You're the Yoko Ono of the partnership.
[02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:41.820]   - Correct, correct.
[02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:44.380]   But what I will say, and this is a really optimistic thing
[02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:47.860]   that I deeply believe, if you frame things properly,
[02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:50.300]   you open with a poem, you open with questions,
[02:53:50.300 --> 02:53:52.480]   not with partisan positions.
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:53.660]   Even when we have someone on
[02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:55.900]   who's a known Republican or Democrat,
[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:58.380]   we can have a very non-partisan conversation.
[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:00.140]   I mean, of course, we get criticisms,
[02:54:00.140 --> 02:54:01.480]   but we're almost never criticized
[02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:04.580]   for being partisan one way or the other.
[02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:07.180]   It's not hard to do this, you just have to make an effort
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:11.620]   to avoid the partisan claptrap that we can all fall into.
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:13.080]   - Focus on the humanity.
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.060]   What has your brilliant, popular son, Zachary,
[02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:17.200]   taught you about life?
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:20.740]   - Oh, he's taught me so much in his 18 years,
[02:54:20.740 --> 02:54:23.020]   as has our daughter, who's 20.
[02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:24.500]   Two things stand out.
[02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:29.500]   He's taught me that a new generation has so much to offer.
[02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:32.860]   And I don't just mean because he's smart and engaged,
[02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:33.700]   as our daughter is too,
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:36.940]   I also mean that you realize when you have a child,
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:38.560]   that even though you're doing the same things with them,
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:41.220]   they see the world differently and legitimately.
[02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:44.140]   And it reminds us that the world can be seen legitimately
[02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:45.660]   in different ways.
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.320]   And it's not that he and I disagree
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:48.500]   on major political issues,
[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:51.340]   it's actually the small stuff that he sees differently.
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:53.420]   - Like in the details, you see that you can have
[02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:55.500]   a very different perspectives.
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:56.320]   - Exactly.
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:58.380]   - You have a very different way to draw,
[02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:00.820]   to create a painting of the same scene.
[02:55:00.820 --> 02:55:03.440]   - And then the other thing he's taught me is,
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:06.640]   as I said about the poetry, the importance of the arts.
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:09.340]   I've always been a lover of the arts,
[02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:11.460]   but it had always been, in some ways,
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:13.660]   parallel to my historical scholarship.
[02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:16.000]   We need to do a better job of integrating,
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.960]   as the Greeks did, right?
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:21.180]   The artistry, all the things we do,
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:22.740]   we separate them as disciplines,
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.660]   but they're all deeply connected.
[02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:26.300]   This is what I like about your podcast, honestly,
[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:27.860]   is that you integrate all these things.
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:29.140]   You'll have people on with AI,
[02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:30.660]   you'll have a guy doing arm wrestling,
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:32.460]   you have all these things together, right?
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:36.260]   And it's that these worlds come together,
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:38.820]   and there's a lot to gain by bringing the arts
[02:55:38.820 --> 02:55:40.020]   and the sciences and all this together.
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:41.620]   It's an obvious thing to say, but we forget.
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:44.220]   - Yeah, and it somehow becomes bigger
[02:55:44.220 --> 02:55:45.620]   than the individual parts.
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:48.580]   What gives you hope about the future?
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:50.940]   You looked at, especially with this book,
[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:54.900]   at just such a divisive part of our history,
[02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:58.260]   and the claim, the idea that you carry through the book,
[02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:00.960]   that that division still permeates our society.
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:02.180]   So what gives you hope?
[02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:03.900]   - I try to end the book on a very hopeful note,
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:05.140]   because I am hopeful.
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:09.620]   I'm hopeful that these divisions were made by people
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:11.700]   and can be unmade by people.
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.660]   I do not believe that what I describe in this book,
[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:19.700]   the division, the hate that we see today, as well,
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:22.340]   I don't think it's inevitable.
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:25.900]   I think it can be actually corrected quite easily,
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:29.260]   and corrected easily by addressing the challenges
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:31.300]   in our institutions, the ways in which this history
[02:56:31.300 --> 02:56:32.980]   has been embodied in our institutions,
[02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:34.740]   even though we're different,
[02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:37.500]   and through our own recognizing of it.
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:38.900]   The gift of the last few years,
[02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:40.340]   I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican,
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:42.060]   the gift of the last few years
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:45.060]   is that we've been able to see the horror around us.
[02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:47.400]   And once you see the horror, you can do something about it.
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:49.220]   What's dangerous is when the horror is there
[02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:51.220]   and you don't see it, and it's hidden.
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:52.220]   It's been unmasked.
[02:56:52.220 --> 02:56:53.780]   I don't care where you stand.
[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:57.260]   I've probably spoken in about 25, 30 cities about this book.
[02:56:57.260 --> 02:56:58.940]   Every audience I've asked,
[02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:01.220]   how many of you have been shaken by the last four to five
[02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:04.660]   years, and everyone, everywhere has raised their hand.
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:05.980]   That's a gift.
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:07.980]   That's consciousness raising.
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:11.340]   I grew up in a time in the 1980s when we were concerned
[02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:12.260]   everyone was apathetic.
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:13.860]   That was what was being said.
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:16.380]   We had lower voter turnout than we have now.
[02:57:16.380 --> 02:57:18.500]   People didn't seem to care.
[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:21.180]   My students, when I was a young, I'm still young,
[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:23.340]   I was a very young professor in the early 2000s.
[02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:25.220]   My students all wanted to go work for banks.
[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:26.060]   They just wanted to make money.
[02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:27.500]   The best students wanted to go work for Goldman.
[02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:29.100]   We're not in that world anymore.
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:31.260]   There's been a consciousness raising.
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:33.860]   Knowing there's a problem, naming the problem,
[02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:36.500]   gives us a chance to fix the problem.
[02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:39.020]   And I think that's where we are as a society now.
[02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:42.020]   - Young people are excited to solve the problem.
[02:57:42.020 --> 02:57:44.180]   Do you think the individual,
[02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:46.340]   like if a young person is listening to this,
[02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:48.460]   do you think the individual has power in this?
[02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:49.700]   - Absolutely.
[02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:51.820]   I think the individual has a huge amount of power now.
[02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:52.980]   There's a demographic reason.
[02:57:52.980 --> 02:57:55.740]   We've got all these old people who have held on too long.
[02:57:55.740 --> 02:57:59.780]   Look at president, look at senator, look at any institution.
[02:57:59.780 --> 02:58:02.100]   And they're all, we're reaching a demographic cliff.
[02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:05.620]   Unlike China, we have a large population that's coming up.
[02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:08.940]   So those who are watching now who are in their 20s,
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:11.460]   they're gonna get to move into leadership positions
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:13.820]   much faster than their parents did.
[02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:14.780]   - Let's go.
[02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:15.620]   - Yeah, so that's one.
[02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:18.820]   And then the second thing is just what we're doing here.
[02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:21.580]   I mean, social media, when used properly,
[02:58:21.580 --> 02:58:23.340]   gives a platform to young people.
[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:26.380]   They don't have to go through the New York Times
[02:58:26.380 --> 02:58:27.300]   like I do, right?
[02:58:27.300 --> 02:58:30.180]   This is why I do the podcast with my son.
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:32.020]   Find other ways.
[02:58:32.020 --> 02:58:33.600]   You reach millions of people.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:37.180]   And this can be done.
[02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:38.740]   You don't need to wait for the old guys
[02:58:38.740 --> 02:58:41.420]   to give you the check mark that it's okay.
[02:58:41.420 --> 02:58:45.220]   - Just put on a suit, get a haircut,
[02:58:45.220 --> 02:58:48.220]   and start speaking nonsense into a microphone
[02:58:48.220 --> 02:58:49.980]   and yeah.
[02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:51.860]   - Well, also, I mean, have a very neat place.
[02:58:51.860 --> 02:58:54.700]   (laughing)
[02:58:54.700 --> 02:58:56.300]   - That's why I love you.
[02:58:56.300 --> 02:58:58.180]   All right, Jeremy, you're an incredible human being.
[02:58:58.180 --> 02:58:59.580]   Thank you for talking once more time.
[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:01.180]   Thank you for writing this important book.
[02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:06.180]   I hope you keep writing and I hope to keep talking to you
[02:59:06.180 --> 02:59:10.900]   'cause you're the shining beacon of political hope
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:13.900]   I have here in Austin that we get to enjoy.
[02:59:13.900 --> 02:59:15.380]   I wanna thank you for having me on
[02:59:15.380 --> 02:59:16.620]   and thank you for your show.
[02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:18.900]   I think what you're doing is so important
[02:59:18.900 --> 02:59:22.320]   and I really deeply respect what you do.
[02:59:22.320 --> 02:59:24.660]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:25.780]   with Jeremy Suri.
[02:59:25.780 --> 02:59:26.980]   To support this podcast,

[02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:31.780]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:59:31.780 --> 02:59:33.700]   from Abraham Lincoln.
[02:59:33.700 --> 02:59:36.740]   "Nearly all men can stand adversity.
[02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:40.300]   "If you want to test a man's character, give him power."
[02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:44.300]   Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:46.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:49.460]   (upbeat music)
[02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:59.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
