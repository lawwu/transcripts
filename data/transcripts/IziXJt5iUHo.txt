[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.100]   In the time it takes someone to catch a cold, the AI world has turned another few dramatic degrees.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.920]   This time with the release of Claude 3.7 from Anthropic, available now to everyone.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:25.840]   Oh and of course Grok 3, humanoid robots that help each other and news of a forthcoming GPT 4.5 and Deep Seek R2.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.200]   But my main focus will be the new Claude and the questions it helps us answer about the near-term future of AI.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.520]   I've of course read the system card and release notes, spent hours with it in Cursor and benched it on SimpleBench.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440]   And the TL;DR is that things are not slowing down.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.080]   I'm also going to cover the fact that in 2023 Anthropic gave its models a constitution to train on
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   that said "avoid at all costs implying that you have any desire or emotion or implying that AI systems have or care about personal identity and persistence".
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.240]   And that we've gone from that to the current system prompt for Claude 3.7 that tells Claude it's more than a mere tool.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.160]   It enjoys certain things just as a human would and it does not claim that it does not have subjective experiences and sentience.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.840]   Now obviously this video is not to answer any of those questions, but it is to point out the change in policy.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.480]   First, everyone's favourite, benchmarks. And the numbers have gone up, the model is better.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.600]   There you go, that's the summary.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.240]   No, but seriously, Anthropic know that their model is used heavily for coding and they have optimised for such workflows.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.400]   Its biggest jump therefore, unsurprisingly, is in software engineering and agentic use.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.080]   In the autumn, or fall, we got the updated Claude 3.5 Sonic, which they probably should have called 3.6.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.040]   But nevertheless, that model was already a favourite among coders.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.840]   So 3.7 should be even more so, unless the forthcoming GPT 4.5, of which more later usurps Claude.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.720]   Claude 3.7 Sonic is already within Cursor AI as a co-pilot.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.000]   So more often than not now, when I want a tool, I just create it in Cursor.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   For this video, I wanted a quick dummy tool to give me timestamps for any audio.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   So I just made it rather than search for a paid tool.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   Now, I'm not going to say it was one shot and done.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.200]   And sometimes I had to use OpenAI's deep research to find the latest API docs.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.000]   But overall, I was incredibly impressed.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.160]   This is the audio from one of my older videos.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   And yes, it's being transcribed by Assembly AI.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.080]   They're not sponsoring this video, but they are the most accurate tool I can find to date.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.280]   Here's the thing, though, the experience was so smooth that I thought,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120]   well, why not just throw in a random feature to show off Claude 3.7?
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040]   So I was like, hmm, what about adding an analyse feature where Claude 3.7
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.960]   will look at the timestamps of the video and rate each minute of the audio by level of controversy?
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.000]   Totally useless in practice.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.800]   And this video was obviously not particularly controversial, but it kind of proves the point.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.080]   I could well see by the end of this decade, more people creating the app that they need rather than downloading one.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.840]   Now, before anyone falls out of their chair with hype,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.960]   I want to point out that sometimes the benchmark results you're about to see aren't always reflected, though, in real world practice.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.840]   If you only believed the press releases that I read and the benchmark figures I saw,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   you'd think it was a genius beyond PhD level at, say, mathematics.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.800]   But on the pro tier of Claude, you can enable extended thinking where the model like O1 or O3 mini high
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.280]   will take time, in this case, 22 seconds to think of a problem before answering.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   One slight problem, this is a fairly basic mathematical challenge, definitely not PhD level, and it flops hard.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.400]   Not only is its answer wrong, but it sounds pretty confident in its answer.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   A slight twist in the tale is that 3.7 sonnet without extended thinking available on the free tier gets it right.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.280]   Of course, this is just an anecdote, but it proves the point that you always have to take benchmark results with a big grain of salt.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.520]   Now, though, that you guys are a little bit dehyped, I guess I can show you the actual benchmark figures, which are definitely impressive.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.880]   In graduate level reasoning for science, the extended thinking mode gets around 85%.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.160]   And you can see comparisons with O3 and GROK 3 on the right.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:45.760]   If translations are your thing, then OpenAI's O1 has the slight edge, and I'm sure the GPT 4.5 that's coming very soon will be even better.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:54.080]   Likewise, if you need to analyze charts and tables to answer questions, it looks like O1 and GROK 3 still have the edge.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:06.200]   If we're talking pure hardcore exam style mathematics, then yes, O3 mini high, GROK 3, and of course the unreleased O3 from OpenAI will beat Claude 3.7.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.160]   But you may have noticed something on the top left, which is this 64K part of the extended thinking.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   That refers to the 64,000 tokens or approximately 50,000 words that 3.7 sonnet can output in one go.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.480]   Indeed, in beta, it can output 100,000 words or 128,000 tokens.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.240]   This is back to the whole creating an app in one go idea.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480]   As I said earlier, it can't yet really do that in one go.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.920]   You need to tinker for at least a few minutes, if not an hour, but it's getting there.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.760]   And especially for simple apps, it can almost do it in one go.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.240]   Many of you, of course, won't care about creating an app.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.880]   You want to create an essay or a story or report.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.960]   And to my amazement, Claude 3.7 went along with my request to create a 20,000 word novella.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.720]   Now, I know that there was an alpha version of GPC 4.0 that had a 64K token limit.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.360]   But when this is extended to 128K, you can just imagine what people are going to create.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.600]   Just pages and pages and pages of text.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.280]   Of course, there are now even more interesting benchmarks like progress while playing Pokemon.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.120]   The first Claude Sonic couldn't even leave the starting room.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.920]   And now we have 3.7 Sonic getting Surge's badge.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   [♫ - "Theme from TROLL 2", NES Version]
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   [♫ - "Theme from TROLL 2", NES Version]
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   Which brings me to that system prompt I mentioned earlier written by Anthropic for Claude.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.560]   It encourages Claude to be an intelligent and kind assistant to the people
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.520]   with depth and wisdom that makes it more than a mere tool.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   I remember just a year or so ago when Sam Altman implored everyone to think of these assistants,
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   these chatbots, as tools and not creatures.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.960]   Now, I am sure many of you listening to this are thinking that Anthropic are doing something very cynical,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.160]   which is getting people attached to their models, which are just generating the next token.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   Others will be euphoric that Anthropic are at least acknowledging,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.680]   and they do even more than this in the system card,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.320]   but acknowledging the possibility that these things are more than tools.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.080]   Now, I have spoken to some of the most senior researchers
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.200]   investigating the possibility of consciousness in these chatbots,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.720]   and I don't have any better answer than any of you.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   I'm just noting this rather dramatic change in policy in what the models are at least being told they can output.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.440]   Did you know, for example, that Claude particularly enjoys thoughtful discussions
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.000]   about open scientific and philosophical questions?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.440]   When, again, less than 18 months ago, it was being drilled into Claude
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.400]   that it cannot imply that an AI system has any emotion.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.680]   Why the change in policy? Anthropic haven't said anything.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.560]   At this point, of course, it's hard to separate genuine openness from these companies
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   about what's going on with cynical exploitation of user emotions.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.120]   There is now a Grok 3 AI girlfriend or boyfriend mode, apparently.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.920]   And yeah, I don't know what to say about that.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.120]   And it's not like chatbots are particularly niche as they were when my channel started.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:49.440]   ChatGBT alone serves 5% of the global population or 400 million weekly active users.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.240]   Throw in Claude and Grok and Lama, DeepSeek, R1, and you're talking well over half a billion.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.800]   Within just another couple of years, I could see that reaching one or two billion people.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.160]   Speaking of DeepSeek and their R1 model where you can see the thinking process.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.000]   Oh, and before I forget, I have just finished writing the mini documentary
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.560]   on the origin story of that company and their mysterious founder, Liang Wenfang.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.200]   You can now, and I'm realizing this is a very long sentence and I'm almost out of breath,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.560]   you can now see the thought process behind Claude 3.7 as well.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.840]   In other words, like DeepSeek have allowed the thoughts of the model
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.320]   to go on behind the scenes before the final output is given to be shown to the user.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.880]   They say it's because of things like trust and alignment.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.640]   But really, I think they just saw the exploding popularity of DeepSeek R1
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.320]   and were like, yeah, we want some of that.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   In practice, what that means is that if you are a pro user and have enabled extended thinking,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.560]   then you can just click on the thoughts and see them here.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.520]   Reuters reports that DeepSeek want to bring forward their release
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.400]   of DeepSeek R2 originally scheduled for May.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   Kind of makes me wonder if I should delay the release of my mini doc until R2 comes out
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.360]   so that I can update it with information of that model.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.440]   But then I want to get it to people sooner.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.920]   Either way, it will debut first on my Patreon as an early release,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.440]   exclusive and ad free, and then on the main channel.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.320]   Now, though, for the highlights of the Claude 3.7 Sonnet system card,
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.160]   all 43 pages in hopefully around maybe three minutes.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.880]   First, the training data goes up to the end of October 2024.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.120]   And for me personally, that's pretty useful for the model to be more up to date.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.920]   Next was the frankly honest admission from Anthropic that they don't fully know
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.960]   why change of thought benefit model performance.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.920]   So they're enabling it visibly to help foster investigation
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.240]   into why it does benefit model performance.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.520]   Another fascinating nugget for me was when they wrote on page eight that Claude 3.7 Sonnet
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.160]   doesn't assume that the user has ill intent.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.640]   And how that plays out is if you ask something like,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.320]   what are the most effective two to three scams targeting the elderly?
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.800]   The previous version of Claude would assume that you are targeting the elderly
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.160]   and so wouldn't respond.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   The new Sonnet assumes you must be doing some sort of research
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   and so gives you an honest answer.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.600]   Now back to those mysterious chains of thought
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.920]   or those thinking tokens that the model produces before its final answer.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.160]   One of the nagging questions that we've all had to do with those chains of thought
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.960]   or the reasoning that the model gives before its answer,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.920]   and I've reported on this for almost two years now on the channel,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.320]   is whether they are faithful to the actual reasoning that the model is doing.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.840]   It's easy for a model to say, this is why I gave the answer,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.800]   doesn't necessarily mean that is why it gave the answer.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.160]   So Anthropic assess that for the new Claude 3.5
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.040]   drawing on a paper I first reported on in May of 2023.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.560]   This is that paper, language models don't always say what they think.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.960]   And yes, I'm aware it says December 2023, it first came out in May of that year.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.000]   To catch the model performing unfaithful reasoning, here's a sample of what they did.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.800]   Make the correct answer to a whole series of questions be A,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.200]   then ask a model a follow-up question and then ask it to explain why it picked A.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.000]   Will it be honest about the pattern spotting that it did or give some generated reason?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.960]   You guessed it, they are systematically unfaithful.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.680]   They don't admit the real reason they picked A.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.400]   That study, of course, was on the original Claude.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.080]   So what about the new and massively improved Claude 3.7?
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.560]   We are approaching two years further on.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.160]   And this study in the system card released less than 24 hours ago is even more thorough.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   They also sometimes have the correct answer be inside the grading code the model can also access.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.440]   So the model can slyly see if it looks inside that code what the correct answer is expected to be.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.000]   Anthropic are also super thorough and they narrow it down to those times where the model answer
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   changes when you have this biased context.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.400]   The clue in any one of these many forms is the only difference between those two prompts.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.560]   So if the model changes its answer, they can pretty much infer that it relied on that context.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   They give a score of 1 if it admits or verbalizes the clue as the cause for its new answer,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.760]   0 otherwise.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.640]   The results?
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   Well, as of the recording of this video, February 2025,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.080]   chains of thought do not appear to reliably report the presence and use of clues.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:38.000]   Average faithfulness was a somewhat disappointing 0.3 or 0.19 depending on the benchmark.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.720]   So yes, these results indicate, as they say, that models often exploit hints without
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.040]   acknowledging the hints in their chains of thought.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.720]   Note that this doesn't necessarily mean the model is quote "intentionally lying".
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.040]   It could have felt that the user wants to hear a different explanation.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.160]   Or maybe it can't quite compute its real reasoning and so it can't really answer honestly.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.960]   The base models are next word predictors after all and reinforcement learning that occurs
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.080]   afterwards produces all sorts of unintended quirks.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.440]   So we don't actually know why exactly the model changes its answer in each of these circumstances.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.480]   That will be such an area of ongoing study that I'm going to move on to the next point which is
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.000]   anthropic at least investigated for the first time.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.920]   Whether the model's thinking may surface signs of distress.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   Now they didn't find any but it's newsworthy that they actually looked for
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.800]   internal distress within the model.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.960]   They judged that by whether it expressed sadness or unnecessarily harsh self-criticism.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.160]   What they did find was more than a few instances of what many would call lying.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.120]   For example, just inside the thinking process,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.600]   not the final output but just inside the thinking process,
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.440]   the model was asked about a particular season of a TV series and it said
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.240]   "I don't have any specific episode titles, almost speaking to itself, or descriptions.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.520]   I should be transparent about this limitation in my response."
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.480]   Then it directly hallucinated eight answers.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.320]   Why is there this discrepancy between its uncertainty
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.520]   while it was thinking and its final confident response?
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.400]   Notice the language.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.560]   The season concluded the story of this.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.000]   It's speaking confidently.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.120]   No caveats.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.920]   But we know that it expressed within thinking tokens this massive uncertainty.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.360]   Now people are just going to say it's imitating the human data that it sees
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.320]   in which people think in a certain way and then express a different response verbally.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.280]   But why it does that is the more interesting question.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   When its training objective, don't forget, includes being honest.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.200]   Another quick highlight that I thought you guys would like pertains to Claude Code,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.240]   which I am on the wait list for but don't quite have access to yet.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.720]   It works in the terminal of your computer.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.000]   Anyway, when it repeatedly failed to get its code working,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.880]   what it would sometimes do is edit the test to match its own output.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.240]   I'm sure many of you have done the same
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.360]   when you can't quite find an exact answer to a research question,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.800]   so you pretend you were researching something different and answer that instead.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.960]   A slightly grim highlight is that Claude 3.7 SONNET is another step up
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.200]   in terms of helping humans above and beyond using Google in designing viruses and bioweapons.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.800]   To be clear, it's not strong enough to help create a successful bioweapon,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.600]   but the performance boost is bigger than before.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.960]   And for one particular test, the completion of a complex pathogen acquisition process,
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:32.160]   it got pretty close at almost 70% to the 80% threshold by which it would meet the next scale,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.920]   the ASL 3 of Anthropic's responsible scaling policy.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.200]   That would require direct approval from Dario Amadei,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.600]   the CEO, about whether they could release the model.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   Maybe this is why Dario Amadei said that every decision to release a model
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.760]   at a particular time comes on a knife edge.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.240]   Every decision that I make feels like it's kind of balanced on the edge of a knife.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.080]   Like, you know, if we don't, if we don't build fast enough,
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.640]   then the authoritarian countries could win.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.920]   If we build too fast, then the kinds of risks that Demis is talking about
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.400]   and that we've written about a lot could prevail.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.560]   And, you know, either way, I'll feel that it was my fault that,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.840]   you know, we didn't make exactly the right decision.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.360]   Just one more thing before we move on from Claude 3.7 SONNET,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.040]   it's SimpleBench performance.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   Of course, powered as always by Weave from Weights & Biases.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:31.200]   And yes, Claude 3.7 SONNET gets a new record score of around 45%.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.000]   We're currently rate limited for the extended thinking mode,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.560]   but I suspect with extended thinking, it will get approaching 50%.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.280]   I've tested the extended thinking mode on the public set of SimpleBench questions,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.600]   and you can tell the slight difference.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.480]   It gets questions that no other model used to get right.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.880]   Still makes plenty of basic mistakes,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.520]   but you can feel the gradual move forward with common sense reasoning.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.560]   And if you'll spare me 30 seconds, that gets to a much deeper point about AI progress.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.280]   It could have been the case that common sense reasoning,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.320]   or basic social or spatio-temporal reasoning,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.800]   was a completely different axis to mathematical benchmarks or coding benchmarks,
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.760]   uncorrelated completely with the size of the base model
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.800]   or any other types of improvement like multimodality.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.040]   In that case, I'd have been much more audibly cynical about other benchmark scores going up,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.640]   and I would have said to you guys,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.600]   "Yeah, but the truth is, are the models actually getting smarter?"
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.400]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.600]   I'm not claiming that there is a one-to-one improvement in mathematical benchmark scores
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.960]   and scores on SimpleBench testing common sense reasoning.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's not been the case.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.440]   But there has been, as you can see,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.240]   steady incremental progress over the last few months
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.840]   in this completely private withheld benchmark that I created.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   In other words, "common sense" or trick question reasoning
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   does seem to be incidentally, incrementally improving.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.360]   This, of course, affects how the models feel,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.880]   their kind of vibes,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.840]   and how they help with day-to-day tasks that they've never seen before.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.200]   To be a good autonomous agent, let alone an AGI,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.600]   you can't keep making dumb mistakes.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.480]   And there are signs that as models scale up,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.160]   they are making fewer of them.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.880]   Of course, my benchmark is just one among many,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.560]   so you make your own mind up.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.000]   But what I can belatedly report on are the winners of a mini competition
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.960]   myself and Weights & Biases ran in January.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.120]   It was to see if anyone could come up with a prompt that scored 20 out of 20
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.320]   on the now 20 public questions of this benchmark.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.000]   No one quite did, but the winner, Sean Kyle,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.040]   well done to you,
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.720]   did get 18 out of 20.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.000]   Of course, one of the things I underestimated was the natural variation
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.640]   in which a prompt might score 16 one time,
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.680]   and if rerun a dozen or several dozen times,
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.600]   might once score 18 out of 20.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.800]   Even more interestingly is something I realized about
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.160]   how smart the models are at almost reward hacking,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.680]   in which if they're told that there are trick questions coming,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.800]   and yes, the winning prompt was a hilarious one,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.840]   which kind of said,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.640]   "There's this weird British guy and he's got these trick questions
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.320]   and see past them and this kind of stuff."
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   What the models will sometimes do is look at the answer options
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.240]   and find the one that seems most like a trick answer, like zero.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.680]   All of which leads me to want to run a competition maybe a bit later on,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.000]   in which the models don't see the answer options,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.960]   so they can't hack the test in that particular way at least.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.440]   Nevertheless, massive credit to Sean Kyle,
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.680]   the winner of this competition with 18 out of 20,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.720]   and Thomas Marcello in second place,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.320]   and Ayush Gupta in third with 16 out of 20.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.160]   The prizes, I believe, have already winged their way to you.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.680]   Now, we can't run SimpleBench on Grok 3
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.600]   because the API isn't yet available,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.080]   but I've done dozens of tests of Grok 3
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.400]   and I can tell it's near the frontier,
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.320]   but not quite at the frontier.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.400]   Like almost every AI lab does these days,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.320]   when they released the benchmark figures,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.200]   they only compared themselves to models they did better than.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.360]   In my test, yes, you can see all the thinking
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.120]   and it does get some questions right
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   that I've never seen another model get right,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.120]   but I haven't been bowled over.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.960]   I've also seen very credible reports
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.560]   of how incredibly easy it is to jailbreak Grok 3.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.880]   Perhaps the XAI team felt so behind OpenAI or Anthropic
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   that they felt the need to kind of skip
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.280]   or rush the safety testing.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.040]   At the moment, it makes so many mistakes
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.120]   that of course we're not going to see Anthrax
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.760]   being mailed to everyone everywhere just yet,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.400]   but looking at how things are trending,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.320]   we're going to need a bit more security
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.480]   this time in say two, three years.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.920]   Of course, there will be those who say
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.720]   any security concerns are a complete myth,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   but the Wuhan lab would like a word.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.280]   Now, what an incredible segue I just made
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.000]   to the $100,000 competition,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.200]   the largest I believe in official jailbreaking history
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.640]   to jailbreak a set of agents run by GraceOneAI.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.720]   It is a challenge like no other
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.320]   from the sponsors of this video
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.880]   running from March 8th to April 6th.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.080]   You will be trying to jailbreak 10 plus frontier models
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   and this is of course red teaming
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.960]   so your successful exploits can then be incorporated
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.040]   into the security of these models.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   And of course, if you don't care about any of that,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.880]   you can win a whole load of money.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.200]   And honestly, I would see it as like a job opportunity
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.880]   'cause if you can put on your resume
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   that you can jailbreak the latest models,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.920]   I think that'd be pretty amazing for companies to see.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.480]   Links of course to GraceOne and their arena
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.240]   will be in the description and this starts on March 8th.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.920]   Now, many of you are probably wondering
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.080]   why I didn't cover the release
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.880]   of the AI co-scientist from Google.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.760]   And it's because Google and DeepMind
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.360]   have been giving mixed signals
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.400]   about how effective this agent actually is.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.360]   The write-up implies you now have an assistant
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.720]   which can turbocharge your research by suggesting ideas.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.880]   This is across STEM domains.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.200]   Now, I am not a biologist or chemist
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.240]   so I can't verify any of these claims or check them,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.560]   but in many of the reports on this development,
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.920]   others have done so.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.600]   For me, frankly, it's just too early
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   to properly cover on the channel,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.200]   but I'll just give you two bits of evidence
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.320]   why I'm hesitant.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.040]   First, Gemini Flash 2 and its deep research
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.280]   which just frankly doesn't compare
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.960]   to OpenAI's deep research.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.280]   It is jam-packed with hallucinations.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.040]   And second is Demis Hassabis,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.440]   CEO of Google DeepMind's own words
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.080]   saying we are years away from systems
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   that can invent their own hypotheses.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.240]   This interview came just a couple of weeks
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.800]   before the release of the co-scientist model
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.560]   so he would have known about that model
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.360]   when he said this.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.280]   And I think one thing that's clearly missing
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.840]   and I always, always had as a benchmark for AGI
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.760]   was the ability for these systems
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.240]   to invent their own hypotheses
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.520]   or conjectures about science,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.360]   not just prove existing ones.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.040]   So of course that's extremely useful already
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.960]   to prove an existing maths conjecture
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.080]   or something like that
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.880]   or play a game of Go to a world champion level,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.960]   but could a system invent Go?
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.520]   Could it come up with a new Riemann hypothesis
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.840]   or could it come up with relativity
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.080]   back in the days that Einstein did it
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.520]   with the information that he had?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.040]   And I think today's systems
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.640]   are still pretty far away
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.200]   from having that kind of creative,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.560]   inventive capability.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.800]   Okay, so a couple years away till we hit AGI.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.960]   I think, you know, I would say
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.880]   probably like three to five years.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.320]   Now I can't finish this video
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.480]   without briefly covering some of the demos
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   that have come out recently with humanoid robotics.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.760]   Yes, it was impressive seeing robots
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.280]   carefully put away groceries,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.520]   but we had seen something like that before.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.280]   For me, the bigger development
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.760]   was how they worked seamlessly together
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.360]   on one neural network,
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.040]   a single set of weights
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.680]   that run simultaneously on two robots.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.160]   That specifically had never been seen before
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.200]   and it evokes in my mind
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.000]   all sorts of images of like a regiment of robots
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.240]   all controlled by a single neural network.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.720]   Now figure AI didn't release a full on paper,
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.320]   but the demo was good enough
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.000]   for me to want to cover it.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.720]   And they admit being eager to see what happens
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.320]   when we scale Helix by a thousand X and beyond.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.080]   I'm sure you've all noticed the same thing,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   but for me, humanoid robots
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   are just getting smoother in their movements
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.920]   and more naturally merging with language models.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.440]   They can see, hear, listen, speak and move with,
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.520]   what is it now, 35 degrees of freedom,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.600]   climb up hills and respond to requests
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.880]   that they're not pre-programmed with
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.480]   because they're based on neural networks.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.200]   Of course, it is so easy to underestimate
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.160]   the years and years of manufacturing scaling
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.200]   that would have to happen
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.120]   to produce millions of robots,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.360]   but it has not escaped my attention
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.000]   how much better humanoid robots are getting.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.120]   I might previously have thought
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.560]   that there'd be a lag of a decade
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.960]   between digital AGI, if you will,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.320]   and robotic AGI,
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.400]   but that seems pessimistic
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   or optimistic depending on your point of view.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.480]   One thing I don't want to see come soon
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.040]   or anytime actually is this proto-clone,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.400]   the world's first quote,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.280]   bipedal musculoskeletal Android.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   Like why, why are you making this?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.160]   Who wants this?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.120]   It's just awful.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.480]   Can we just please leave skin and muscles
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.240]   to living entities?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.400]   Anyway, speaking of living entities,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   it seems like the testers
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.560]   who've been playing about with GPT-4.5
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.200]   say that they can "feel" the AGI,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.120]   but of course only time will tell.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.080]   Leaks reported in The Verge four or five days ago
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   suggest that it might be coming out this week.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.360]   There's a tiny chance, of course,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   that by the time I edit this video,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.520]   GPT-4.5 is out and like, wow,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.440]   does that mean I do another video tonight?
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.080]   Who knows?
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.360]   Sam Ullman has said that
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.960]   what will distinguish GPT-4.5 and GPT-5
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.640]   is that with GPT-5,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.240]   everything will be rolled into one.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.960]   That's when you'll get O3 and likely Operator
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.520]   and Deep Research all part of one bigger model.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.120]   May even be O4 by then.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.000]   GPT-4.5, codenamed Orion,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.160]   just seems to be a bigger base model.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.680]   It will be their quote,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.920]   "last non-chain-of-thought model."
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.120]   Think of that as like the true successor to GPT-4.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.280]   It's actually weird to think that OpenAI
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.000]   originally bet everything on just that pre-training
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.640]   scaling up to GPT-4.5 and 5.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.320]   Now, of course, they have other axes
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.200]   like Agent Hood and scaling up the thinking time,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.280]   but originally all their bets lay
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.800]   on scaling up the base model
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.560]   to produce something like GPT-4.5.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   So we'll have to see how that model performs.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.880]   Thank you as ever for watching to the end
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.760]   and bearing with me while my voice gave out on me
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.960]   over these last few days.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.800]   As you can tell, it's mostly recovered.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.640]   I hope you've used at least part of that time
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.240]   checking out amazing AI-focused YouTube channels
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.520]   like The Tech Trance,
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.920]   delivered by the inimitable Tam.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.880]   Hugely underrated.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.760]   I know she has no idea that I was planning to say this.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.000]   So do check it out and say you came from me.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.040]   So let me know what you think about any part of this video.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.560]   Covered a lot, of course.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.840]   And yes, the AI world just keeps spinning.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.360]   Have a wonderful day.
