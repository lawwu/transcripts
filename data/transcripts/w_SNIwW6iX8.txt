[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   So I think you and I eat similar diets, at least I was...
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.280]   It's the first time I've heard this.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   Yeah, so I was doing it before...
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.000]   First time anyone has said that to me, in this case.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.600]   Yeah, but it's becoming more and more cool.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.160]   But I was doing it before it was cool.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.720]   So the intermittent fasting and fasting in general, I really enjoy.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.720]   I love food, but I enjoy the...
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.120]   I also love suffering because I'm Russian, so fasting kind of makes you appreciate the...
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.160]   Makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   But I have a...
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.360]   Outside the philosophical stuff, I have a more specific question.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.400]   It also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker, like from the scientific perspective,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.640]   to sit there for many hours and focus deeply.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.440]   Maybe you were a hacker before you were CEO.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.240]   What have you learned about diet, lifestyle, mindset that helps you maximize mental performance
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.720]   to be able to focus for...
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.600]   To think deeply in this world of distractions?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.960]   I think I just took it for granted for too long.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   Which aspect?
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.800]   Just the social structure of we eat three meals a day and there's snacks in between.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   And I just never really asked the question why.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.360]   Oh, by the way, in case people don't know, I think a lot of people know, but you at least
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.560]   do famously eat once a day.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.280]   You still eat once a day?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   Yep.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   I eat dinner.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.360]   By the way, what made you decide to eat once a day?
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.880]   Because to me, that was a huge revolution that you don't have to eat breakfast.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.880]   That was like...
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880]   I felt like I was a rebel.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560]   Like I abandoned my parents or something and became an anarchist.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   It does feel...
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560]   When you first...
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.560]   The first week you start doing it, it feels you kind of have a superpower.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.200]   And you realize it's not really a superpower.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.840]   But I think you realize, at least I realized, just how much our mind dictates what we're
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.840]   possible of.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.720]   And sometimes we have structures around us that incentivize this three meal a day thing,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.840]   which was purely social structure versus necessity for our health and for our bodies.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   And I did it just...
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.760]   I started doing it because I played a lot with my diet when I was a kid and I was vegan
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.840]   for two years and just went all over the place just because health is the most precious thing
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.380]   we have and none of us really understand it.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.640]   So being able to ask the question through experiments that I can perform on myself and
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.600]   learn about is compelling to me.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   And I heard this one guy on the podcast, Wim Hof, who's famous for doing ice baths and
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.160]   holding his breath and all these things.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.960]   He said he only eats one meal a day.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   I'm like, "Wow, that sounds super challenging and uncomfortable.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   I'm going to do it."
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   So I just...
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.600]   I learn the most when I make myself...
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.400]   I wouldn't say suffer, but when I make myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:25.520]   to bear in those moments and you really learn what you're about or what you're not.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.560]   So I've been doing that my whole life.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.040]   When I was a kid, I could not speak.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.400]   I had to go to a speech therapist and it made me extremely shy.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.000]   And then one day I realized I can't keep doing this and I signed up for the speech club.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.720]   And it was the most uncomfortable thing I could imagine doing, getting a topic on a
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.280]   note card, having five minutes to write a speech about whatever that topic is, not being
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about that topic.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.320]   But it just, it puts so much...
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.200]   It gave me so much perspective around the power of communication, around my own deficiencies
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.600]   and around if I set my mind to do something, I'll do it.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.840]   So it gave me a lot more confidence.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   So I see fasting in the same light.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.240]   This is something that was interesting, challenging, uncomfortable, and has given me so much learning
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.760]   and benefit as a result.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.600]   And it will lead to other things that I'll experiment with and play with.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.200]   But yeah, it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680]   The most boring superpower one can imagine.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.440]   No, it's quite incredible.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.960]   The clarity of mind is pretty interesting.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.040]   (laughs)
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   (silence)
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.360]   (silence)
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.520]   (silence)
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.680]   (silence)
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.840]   (silence)
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.000]   (silence)
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   (silence)
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
