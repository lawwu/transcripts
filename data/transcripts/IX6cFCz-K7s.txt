[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   If you're wondering whether it's really worth switching, I guess it depends a little bit on
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.000]   how much cash you have. But I would say the average person listening to this episode who's
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   using an account at a regular bank is probably missing out on at least $1,000 a year of interest
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.040]   by using the wrong bank account. Maybe $1,000 isn't important to you. Maybe it's super meaningful.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.240]   I have a feeling that if it's not important, you probably also keep a lot more money in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.800]   checking accounts. So maybe that number will be a lot higher for you. If you do have $50,000,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   $100,000, or maybe you're even saving for a down payment or you're making regular tuition payments,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.400]   missing out on 5% is going to be thousands of dollars a year. And even if the alternative
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.200]   isn't zero, but it's 0.48% like you're getting at Schwab or 0.25% like you're getting at the
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.720]   Ally checking account, it's still close to $1,000 a year. So to me, that's worth it,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.000]   especially when some of these products are such a better experience.
