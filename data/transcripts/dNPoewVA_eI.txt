[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Well, a lot of listeners to this podcast
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.600]   listen on their drive to work in the morning,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.640]   so it seems especially relevant for us to talk about work.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   We don't wanna waste our jobs, none of us do.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   We spend so much time at work
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.560]   and it's a place to pursue excellence, but why?
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.720]   Why should we pursue excellence at work
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.880]   when we often don't see any eternal value
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.960]   in our weekly duties and our routines?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.920]   It's a question today from a listener named Dylan.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.760]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   In Colossians 3, 22 to 24,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.640]   Paul exhorts his readers to work heartily
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.240]   as for the Lord and not for men.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.840]   Does this mean that any work not done in excellence
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.280]   is sinful?
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040]   And how do we apply God's view of work
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.480]   to cleaning our house, writing a paper for school,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.320]   or working a nine to five job?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.520]   I've been feeling guilty
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.480]   about the way I handle these things for months now,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.200]   and I'm not sure if I'm just being lazy, self-righteous,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.160]   or am I disobeying the Lord?
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.440]   - Well, the first thing with regard to his guilt
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   or feeling guilty is that the Bible handles guilt
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.760]   in two ways, and both are very important, not just one.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.600]   One is the blood of Jesus that covers all our sin,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.320]   including how we do our work,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.320]   and none of us does our work as well as we could.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.920]   We're always falling short of the ideal.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120]   One is the blood of Jesus that cancels our guilt,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.000]   and the other is to resolve to walk and work faithfully
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.320]   before the Lord in the freedom of that forgiveness.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.440]   If we try to use the blood of Jesus as a free pass
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.240]   to walk in sin, our conscience will rise up and protest.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.400]   Thank God.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   And if we try to walk in faithfulness and obedience
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   without relying on the blood of Jesus for forgiveness
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.480]   and enablement, we will either fail in despair
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.040]   or we will look like we succeed and become proud.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.800]   It's the two together, the blood of Jesus
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.840]   and the resolve of walking and working faithfully,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   obediently, that's the key to the peaceful life
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.400]   of being forgiven before God and being vigilant
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.800]   over our hearts and minds as we go about our daily tasks.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   So what is God's will for how we should do
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.280]   our ordinary work, and then in particular,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   what is as for the Lord, working as for the Lord
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.960]   mean in Colossians 3.23?
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.520]   Let's get the bigger picture first.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   In the Bible, God makes total, absolute claim
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   on our lives, all of our lives,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   including all of our work of whatever kind.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   Everything in our lives is to be done
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   before the face of God in reliance upon God's grace,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.240]   according to God's guidance, for God's glory.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.520]   Listen to these amazing passages.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   This is Colossians 3.17, "Whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.640]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus."
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.760]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.320]   Every word, every deed in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   Or 1 Corinthians 10.31, "Whether you eat or drink
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.760]   Or Proverbs 3, 5, and 6, "Trust in the Lord
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.680]   with all your heart.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.880]   Do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   In all your ways, all your ways, acknowledge him
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.960]   and he'll make your paths straight."
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.840]   Or Proverbs 6.3, "Commit your work to the Lord
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.240]   and your plans will be established."
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.360]   Or one of my favorites from Romans 14,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   just 'cause it's so amazingly sweeping
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.520]   in calling us to live Godward lives.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.800]   "The one who observes the day,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.040]   observes it in honor of the Lord.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.920]   since he gives thanks to God.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.560]   While the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920]   and gives thanks to God.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   For no one lives to himself and no one dies to himself.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.880]   For if we live, we live to the Lord.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.680]   If we die, we die to the Lord.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.120]   So whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.620]   For to this end, Christ died and lived again,
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.840]   that he might be Lord, both of the living and the dead."
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   Amazing, I love it.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.160]   Oh, how I wanna live to the Lord, before the Lord,
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.440]   always with reference to the Lord.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.000]   All those texts have one basic message.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.360]   We belong to God, we're not our own.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.920]   Everything we do from morning till night
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.640]   is to be done in a Godward, Godward way,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.400]   before his face in reliance on his grace,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.880]   guided by his will,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.760]   aiming to make him look magnificent and glorious
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.040]   as our all satisfying treasure.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.020]   That's what work is for.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.660]   That's what all of life is for.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   And I don't know whether Dylan knows my book,
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.320]   "Don't Waste Your Life,"
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.880]   but there's a chapter called,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.780]   from eight to five or something like that,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.360]   and tries to grapple with how do you go about
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   doing your daily work so as not to waste what it's for.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.000]   Now, just a few words about Colossians 3.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.760]   Here's the text that Dylan is exercised about.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.840]   It's got the phrase in it,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.480]   "Work as for the Lord and not for men."
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.320]   It goes like this,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.840]   "Bond servants, obey in everything
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.720]   those who are your earthly masters,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.140]   not by way of eye service as men pleasers,
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.080]   but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.780]   whatever you do, work heartily,"
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.460]   here it is, "as for the Lord, as for the Lord."
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.760]   So work as for the Lord and not for men,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.960]   "knowing that from the Lord you will receive
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.700]   the inheritance as your reward,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.640]   you are serving the Lord Christ."
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.620]   So work as for the Lord,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.120]   and Paul modifies this command in five ways
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.400]   so we can know, there's not much doubt here
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.760]   how Paul thinks about this.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.840]   There are five modifiers to what he means by,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.120]   as for the Lord.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.120]   Number one, not to be done with eye service as men pleasers.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.160]   That is, you're not just angling to impress others
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.980]   when you do your work.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.580]   God, not others, is the one you have in view.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580]   You're working in a Godward way first, not a manward way.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.660]   Number two, the opposite of eye service is sincerity,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.140]   he says.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.320]   In other words, you really mean the good
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   that your work is aiming to do.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.360]   The work is not to impress others.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.140]   The work is what it is.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.340]   It's for the good of others.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.720]   Number three, fearing the Lord.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.280]   In other words, fearing displeasing the Lord,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   having a reverential desire to please the Lord
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.640]   in the way you do your work.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   Number four, working heartily, literally from the soul.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.920]   That is, not half-heartedly,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.200]   but putting your whole self into it.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   And number five, expecting a great reward from the Lord,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.040]   even if man gives you nothing for it.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.500]   That doesn't matter in the end.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.360]   What matters in the end is you're gonna get
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.720]   totally overabundance, poured down, pressed together,
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.120]   overflowing in your lap, reward from the Lord.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.860]   Now, all five of those guidelines
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.760]   for how we do our work for the Lord
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   are given to us not because the Lord needs our work.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   He doesn't, Acts 17, 25.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.280]   God is not served by human hands as though
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.240]   he needed anything.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.920]   God doesn't need our work.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.520]   That's not the point.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.000]   Paul gave us these instructions
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.720]   because this will bring the greatest joy to us
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.440]   when we work this way,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.680]   and will show that God is our greatest treasure.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.520]   Amen, yeah, what a great perspective
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.640]   to have on all of our daily labor,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.520]   bringing eternal reality to bear on our daily lives
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   and what we most treasure.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.280]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.920]   and making the podcast part of your week.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.680]   Three times a week we publish,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.400]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.160]   and search our past episodes in our archive.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.740]   Even reach us by email with a question of your own,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.580]   even questions related to work and vocation
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.400]   and all the time that we spend at our jobs.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.740]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.980]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.880]   Well, at DG, we often talk about God having two wills,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.300]   two wills, a will of decree and a will of desire,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.360]   which leads to the theological question,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.580]   does God ever decree something that he does not desire?
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.720]   Wouldn't that cause in him a divided mind?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   Now, this is a fairly technical question,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.280]   and we'll give more background to make more sense of it.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.760]   If this is brand new to you,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.440]   we'll explain it more, I promise.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   But that's next time on Monday when we return.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhke.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.500]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.660]   (upbeat music)
