[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Hello and welcome back to the podcast on this Wednesday.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.160]   Okay, so the passions of the flesh
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.340]   wage war against our souls.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.060]   That's 1 Peter 2, verse 11.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.080]   That's what we looked at in depth last time
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.180]   with Pastor John in the studio on Monday in APJ 1825.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.740]   The desires of the flesh draw us away
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.040]   from the all satisfying fullness of Christ.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.960]   That's what we talked about there.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.680]   It's big, I mean, that's a huge point.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.760]   And I wanna return to that text and to that verse
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.300]   and to the verse after it,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.000]   because in them we encounter the two greatest questions
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640]   faced by the universe.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.980]   No joke.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.840]   The universe's two greatest questions are answered
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.300]   here in 1 Peter 2, verses 11 and 12.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.180]   There Peter wrote, "Beloved," writing to Christians,
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.760]   "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.200]   to abstain from the passions of the flesh
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.120]   which wage war against your soul.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.160]   Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.520]   so that when they speak against you as evildoers,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.280]   they may see your good deeds and glorify God
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.600]   on the day of visitation."
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.400]   These two verses answer the two most gigantic issues
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   faced by the universe.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.880]   To make the claim and to defend it,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.020]   here's Pastor John in a 1994 sermon.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.480]   In those two verses, two issues
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.320]   are seen to be massively important.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.240]   In fact, I would say they are the two most important issues
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.200]   in the world, in the universe.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.600]   They are the two issues that the whole Bible
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960]   deals with throughout.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.480]   And one of the ways that we know that we are aliens
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.520]   and exiles and strangers, like verse 11 says,
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840]   is that the world by and large does not think
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   that they are important issues.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.200]   If the world did, the newspaper will look different,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.920]   television would look different,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.840]   radio would sound different,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.760]   university classes would sound different,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   advertising would be different, business would be different.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.720]   But by and large, these two issues,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.880]   which the Bible treats as the most important issues
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.160]   in the world, are non-issues in our world,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.080]   which makes aliens out of us
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.240]   who get our bearings from the Bible.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.200]   The two issues are these,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.440]   the salvation of the human soul
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.480]   and the glory of the name of God.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.940]   Or to put it another way,
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.040]   the two big issues in the Bible and in the world are
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   how do you save the soul so that it's not destroyed
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140]   and how do you glorify God so that he's not belittled?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.720]   Those are the two huge issues in these two verses.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.480]   Let's just get that before we even talk about any details.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.320]   Verse 11, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.700]   "to abstain from fleshly lusts,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   "which wage war against the soul."
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.360]   The issue here is whether the soul
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.880]   is gonna be so fought against that it dies,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   that it is lost.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.900]   There are anti-soul forces in the world.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.380]   I mean, the world by and large
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.520]   doesn't even think about its soul.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.840]   But this text says there's a war going on
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.520]   and there are desires in the world
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   that are waging war trying to bring my soul to ruin.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.680]   And if it succeeds, if the anti-soul forces win,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.080]   my soul is lost.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.280]   And if my soul is lost, everything is lost,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.800]   then there is no recovery.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   Remember what Jesus said,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.760]   "What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   "and loses his soul?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.360]   "For what can a man give in exchange for his soul?"
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   Which means if the soul has been lost,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.080]   there's no negotiating anymore.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.980]   If the soul is lost, you don't buy it back.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.600]   It's gone.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.360]   If anti-soul forces win, they win.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.880]   It's over.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.440]   Jesus said in Luke 16,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.040]   when he was talking about the rich man and Lazarus,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   and the rich man went to Hades
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   and Lazarus went to Abraham's lap,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.920]   and they were granted for a moment
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.040]   to see and commune in word.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.120]   And the man in Hades said,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.460]   "Just send him over with a drop of water.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.000]   "I am in torment in these flames."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.600]   And Abraham said, "There is a gulf here
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.180]   "that is so big, so wide, so deep
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.180]   "that God has ordained nobody crosses either way ever."
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.120]   It's over.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.940]   That's an awesome reality.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.840]   This is a reality that has to do with everybody.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.580]   It has to do with everybody forever.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.140]   And it has to do with everybody forever
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.140]   in huge ways that have to do with hell and heaven.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   And yet there's no column in the newspaper.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.840]   There's no public service announcement on the radio.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.520]   There's no soundbite on television.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.840]   There's no values clarification course at the university
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.520]   or in our schools.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.940]   There's no government agency.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.560]   There's not even a welfare pamphlet
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   that gives one hint as to how to fight for our souls.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.680]   The biggest issue that our souls face
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.880]   is a non-issue in the world.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.360]   It's a non-issue, which is why you're an alien
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   and a stranger.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.820]   They, the world order, teach us how to fight AIDS
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.080]   and how to fight mosquitoes and sunstroke
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   and drunk driving and pollen and depression
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.320]   and rape and fire and theft and cholesterol
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.440]   and dandelions, but they don't teach us
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.960]   how to fight for our soul.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.240]   Our world, you must get this,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   our world is passionately committed
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.340]   to the inconsequential.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.520]   One of these days, that will not be the case.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.920]   The eyes of the world will be opened
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.040]   and our obliviousness to what will then be seen
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.000]   to be so obvious will so stun the world
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.240]   that we will have no explanation
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.640]   for how we lived the way we lived in America.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.200]   How the eternal condition of the human soul
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   could be a non-issue will be absolutely inexplicable.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.840]   It will boggle the mind as we stand before our judge.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.520]   We're aliens.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.040]   That's the first great issue.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.840]   How shall the soul of man be saved
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.800]   and not destroyed forever and ever?
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   That is a big issue.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.700]   Here's the second one.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.000]   Verse 12, keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.480]   so that in the thing in which they slander you as evil doers
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.960]   they may on account of your good deeds
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   as they observe them, give glory to God
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.180]   on the day of visitation.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.180]   The first issue is how the soul shall not be lost.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.780]   The second issue is how God shall not be belittled
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.300]   or to make it positive, how the soul shall be saved
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.500]   and now how God shall be glorified.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.660]   The salvation of the soul and the glory of God
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.500]   are the two biggest issues in the universe
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   and they're non-issues for most people in America.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.900]   This text says, the goal of all human behavior
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.580]   is to be the glory of God.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.020]   Isn't that an incredibly sweeping statement?
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.660]   The goal of all your behavior
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.420]   from the time you get up in the morning
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   until you go to bed at night is to draw attention to God.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.220]   That's the significance of human life.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.740]   The positive significance of human life
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.740]   consists in our capacity to deflect attention
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.260]   from ourselves to God.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.980]   That's the meaning of human life as God intended it to be.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.420]   You see that, I'm not making that up, that's right here.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.020]   Keep your behavior excellent
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.700]   so that the Gentiles might glorify God.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.700]   Live, conduct yourselves, act, behave with a mind.
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:16.780]   How can I direct their attention to God by the way I live?
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.740]   That's what life is for.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   We live in order to get attention for God.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.740]   If we don't, if we don't live for God's glory,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.660]   we become simply a little echo of a God neglecting culture.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.980]   So echo.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.940]   We fit in so well to this world
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.260]   that we can't direct anybody's attention out of the world,
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.940]   which is where God is.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:59.420]   I just have the feeling that we're so afraid of being Amish,
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:06.620]   dressing wrong, riding a horse drawn carriage
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.260]   and being anti-modern or getting the wrong tie
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.860]   or not having a tan or,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.700]   we're just so afraid of not being in step
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.100]   that we blend so well, nobody's saying,
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.100]   "Wow, look at God," anymore because of the church.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.900]   - Man, classic John Pfeiffer.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.180]   It's a clip from his 1 Peter 2, 11 and 12 sermon titled,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.220]   "The War Against the Soul and the Glory of God,"
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.260]   fittings title.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.420]   It was preached on May 22nd, 1994
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.220]   and the whole thing is online, of course,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.420]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.740]   If you have a great sermon clip like this one,
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.500]   share it with me, email me, give me your name, hometown,
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.580]   the sermon title and the timestamp
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.180]   of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.020]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.700]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email

[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.380]   Well, we're back on Friday to talk predestination.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.740]   It's a topic that comes up a lot, as you would expect.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.740]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.220]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.460]   when we return on Friday to talk predestination.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.300]   See you then.
