[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660]   - Welcome back to the podcast on this Friday morning
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.760]   as we close out the week
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.680]   and we're about to close out the year too
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.080]   here in our final weeks of 2022.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.520]   We're closing out the year with something
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.100]   we've never done before on the podcast.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.920]   We're gonna introduce you to some of our key
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.300]   international partners.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.720]   Desiring God's books and articles,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.860]   even this podcast get translated into dozens of languages
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.460]   around the world.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.600]   And to do it, we need help, lots of help.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   And that's what we have.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   And so today we get to hear what God is doing
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.100]   in the French speaking world
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.920]   through our friend Daniel Henderson.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.200]   Stay tuned for that at the end of today's episode.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.560]   And as you can imagine, Pastor John,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   based on what I just said,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   we are big believers in international missions
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.800]   and reaching the globally lost,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760]   which leads to today's question from Michael
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.540]   who lives in Arrington, Tennessee.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.240]   Michael writes this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.560]   I've heard Orthodox preachers say in the past
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.060]   that God could reveal the gospel to a native tribesman
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.720]   who has never been witnessed to by another human.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.860]   Do you believe this is true?
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.740]   Can we have any hope that God occasionally revealed
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.660]   the gospel to a particular person supernaturally
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.100]   without any human witnessing,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.480]   say to an unreached Native American
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.500]   or to a Jewish prisoner of war in World War II?"
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.740]   And however you answer this question,
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.380]   how should we think about Paul's conversion by vision
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380]   in Galatians 1:12?
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.260]   - Let's start where Michael's question ends.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.260]   He wonders about how the apostle Paul's conversion
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.300]   came about in relationship to how conversion comes about
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.820]   today through the preaching of the gospel
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.820]   or perhaps by other means through direct revelation, say,
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.220]   or through dreams.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.300]   And it is a very perceptive and relevant question
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   because Paul stresses in Galatians
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.300]   that his own transforming encounter with the risen Christ
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.820]   was not dependent on any human being,
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.500]   but came by direct revelation.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.440]   In fact, his entire argument for his apostleship
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.860]   in the first two chapters of Galatians
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.060]   hangs on that very fact.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.300]   Here's what he says in chapter one, verse 11 and 12.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.180]   "I would have you know, brothers,
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.700]   that the gospel that was preached by me
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.660]   is not man's gospel.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.660]   I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.640]   but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.060]   And then to underline the point
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.080]   of being dependent on no one except the risen Christ,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   he says in verses 15 through 17,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.760]   "When he who had set me apart before I was born
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.320]   and who called me by his grace
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.400]   was pleased to reveal his son to me
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.920]   in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.480]   I did not immediately consult with anyone,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.720]   nor did I go up to Jerusalem
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.500]   to those who were apostles before me,
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   but I went away to Arabia and returned again to Damascus."
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.760]   So the point of Paul's argument
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   is that his unique apostolic authority
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.100]   over against ordinary Christians in the early church
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.000]   is based on his unique way of encountering Christ
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.800]   and being called into the ministry.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   So it would be wrong to use Paul's unique experience
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.520]   to say that's how other people around the world
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   can come to Christ.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   Paul's point is just the opposite.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.940]   My dependence on no other humans
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.300]   is the warrant for my apostleship,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.960]   not a model for evangelism.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.080]   If others could come to Christ this way,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.300]   my argument would lose its force.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.360]   So that's my answer to the last part of Michael's question.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.080]   Paul's experience is not a model
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.160]   for how people can come to Christ without human input.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.460]   So what about the first part of Michael's question,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.760]   which is even more important?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   Can a person be saved who has never been witnessed to,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.440]   preached to by another human?
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.680]   This is a hugely important question,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.460]   especially for people involved in world missions.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.140]   Does God save people who have never heard the gospel
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.520]   through a human witness?
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.640]   Does he, for example, give them dreams
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.580]   of all they need to know about Christ to be saved?
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.560]   This is so important that in my book on missions,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.400]   "Let the Nations Be Glad,"
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.800]   there's a whole long, long chapter about this issue.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.640]   And we thought it was so crucial
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.800]   that His Desire and God and the publisher
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.160]   thought it was so crucial that we published a small book
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.760]   from that chapter called "Jesus, the Only Way to God,"
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.640]   subtitle, "Must You Hear the Gospel to Be Saved?"
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.560]   So I can only mention a few pointers here,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.280]   but there's more out there to read if you want to follow up.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.400]   My answer is no.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.440]   God does not save people today
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.320]   apart from hearing the gospel of Jesus.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   And the reason is that God's purpose
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.800]   ever since the incarnation of Christ as the God-man
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.200]   is that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, crucified and risen,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   is to be the conscious focus of all saving faith
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.760]   everywhere in the world, among all the peoples of the world.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.560]   For example, Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:21,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.040]   "Since in the wisdom of God,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   the world did not know God through wisdom,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.240]   it pleased God through the folly of what we preach
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.560]   to save those who believe."
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.120]   It was the wisdom of God that decreed
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.040]   that people would not come to know Him
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.880]   except through the preaching of Jesus.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.280]   The incarnate, crucified, risen Son of God
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.160]   is so gloriously pivotal in God's purposes
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.480]   for the revelation of Himself in history
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.960]   that all saving faith orients on this Christ,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.460]   and particularly as He is preached in the gospel.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.200]   Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   No one comes to the Father except through me," John 14:6.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.600]   The apostles proclaim that very truth
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.000]   in these words in Acts 4.12.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.760]   There is salvation in no one else,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.440]   for there is no other name under heaven
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.620]   given among men by which we must be saved.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.840]   And then Paul put the finest point on it
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.920]   by arguing that this saving name
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.640]   must be preached and heard and believed
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.560]   for people to be saved.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.600]   Here's Romans 10.13-17.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.960]   Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.120]   the Lord Jesus, will be saved.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   How then will they call on Him whom they have not believed?
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.800]   How shall they believe in Him
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.900]   of whom they have never heard?
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.520]   And how shall they hear without someone preaching?
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   And how are they to preach unless they are sent?
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.240]   So faith comes from hearing
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.600]   and hearing through the word of Christ."
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.780]   In other words, I don't think the Bible gives us
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.920]   any encouragement at all
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.280]   to believe that a person can come to saving faith
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.940]   without hearing the gospel.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.320]   This is why world missions and personal evangelism
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.860]   are so utterly crucial.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.160]   If we ask about the role of dreams and visions,
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.360]   say on the mission field,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.200]   the guidance that the New Testament gives us
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.660]   is the story of Cornelius, the Roman centurion
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.880]   who got a vision of an angel speaking to him
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.600]   that resulted in his conversion to Christianity.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   But Peter explains how this vision led to his salvation.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.280]   Here's what Peter says about that transaction
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.840]   in Acts 11:13-14.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.000]   Peter said, "Cornelius told us
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.800]   send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.960]   He will declare to you a message
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.240]   by which you will be saved,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   you and all your household."
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:46.080]   The vision from the angel was not the saving message.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.680]   The vision connected him with Peter
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.760]   who preached the saving message about Jesus.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.140]   If God uses dreams or visions,
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.120]   I think biblically that's the way he's going to use them.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.360]   So my conclusion is that God has mercifully provided
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.260]   a way of salvation through the glorious gospel of Christ.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.600]   And he says to us, to missionary goers
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   and to senders in the words of Acts 26, 17,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.800]   the risen Christ now talking to Paul
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.080]   and really to all of us who care about bringing people
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.620]   out of darkness into light, he says,
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.620]   "I am sending you, you, you human being,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.960]   I am sending you to open their eyes
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.500]   so that they may turn from darkness to light
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.080]   and from the power of Satan to God,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.360]   that they may receive forgiveness of sins
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.240]   and a place among all those
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.880]   who are sanctified by faith in me."
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.400]   So God uses people, speaking people,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.320]   acting people, loving people,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.560]   God uses people to save people.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.120]   Let's be about that.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   - Amen, Pastor John.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.040]   And speaking of being speaking people,
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.680]   ministry is about words, lots of words,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.000]   words preached, words published, words podcasted,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.440]   and of course, words translated.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.160]   And to that end, we have a team of friends
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.560]   who labor to make Desiring God resources accessible
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.600]   to non-English speakers,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.440]   and one of them is Daniel Henderson.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.880]   Daniel pours out his life
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.200]   to serve the French-speaking world,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.620]   and we asked him for a ministry update.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.040]   Here he is.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.460]   - My name is Daniel Henderson,
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.400]   and I'm from Chewinigan, Quebec.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.160]   I'm serving with a ministry called Pouglie-Castron Chrétien,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.440]   and we exist to equip the church with resources in French
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.960]   to make disciples, to train leaders,
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.360]   and to share the gospel.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.780]   Desiring God is one of the first ministries
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.920]   that comes to mind for our ministry
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   when we're looking for biblical content
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.960]   that doesn't apologize for what the Bible teaches.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.080]   We've translated 15 to 20 books.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.720]   We've translated over 200 Ask Pastor Johns.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.440]   We've translated 365 Solid Joy episodes.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.840]   We've done one conference in person in Paris,
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.560]   and we've done one online conference
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.480]   with John Piper during COVID.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.400]   One of the reasons I love working with Desiring God
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.400]   is because it's not just about projects.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.960]   It's about seeing us and our team grow
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.480]   as disciples of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.660]   It's about seeing our love for Christ increased.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.920]   It's about seeing these projects actually have an impact
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.760]   in the French-speaking world.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   Our partnership with Desiring God
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   has been our own personal discipleship.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.680]   It's been our own growing in Christ,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.800]   seeing our love for Christ be increased.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.600]   But it's also been Desiring God connecting us
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.640]   with all the other international partners
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.860]   and positioning us in the global community of the church.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.880]   So we're not just a French publisher working on our own,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.600]   but we're working alongside a Portuguese partner,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.040]   a South African partner, a German partner,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.320]   an Egyptian partner.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.280]   There's not other ministries doing that.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.120]   That's a unique thing that Desiring God is doing,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.080]   bringing us all together.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.800]   It's not just handing out projects.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.280]   You know, it's not just, "Hey guys,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.440]   we're excited about this book.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.080]   Can you translate it?"
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.760]   It's creating a community of international publishers
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.960]   that are working together,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.360]   that are also keeping each other accountable,
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.880]   bearing another's burden, praying for one another.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.240]   It's more than just the product.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.040]   And Desiring God brings us all together
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.280]   and gives us a bigger picture
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.760]   of what God's doing in the world.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.880]   And ultimately, that helps us to glorify God
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.840]   with greater passion.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.160]   - Amazing testimony.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.080]   Thank you, Daniel, for your tireless and selfless labors.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.720]   And if you're listening right now
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.980]   and you are a ministry partner with us at Desiring God,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.860]   you're making Daniel's work possible.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.120]   You are, you.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.280]   I'm pointing at my microphone, you.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   You listening right now, thank you for your partnership.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.960]   And if you're not yet a partner
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.340]   and you want to join in what's happening
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.760]   through Desiring God in the English-speaking world
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.280]   and its overflow into Daniel's work
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.560]   to reach the French-speaking world,
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.640]   you can join us right now
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.840]   by becoming a monthly ministry partner.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   So much of our financial support
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.280]   comes from friends of ours who give, on average,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.620]   $30 a month to support all of our work.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.620]   To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.640]   That's give.desiringgod.org.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.040]   It's hugely appreciated as you make it possible
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.080]   for us to expand our work even further in the years ahead.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.660]   So thank you.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.860]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:15:02.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
