[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   When you pray, Jesus said, get by yourself,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.460]   go into your room, shut the door,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.780]   and pray to your Father who is in secret.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.860]   It's Matthew 6, 6.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.120]   Sounds pretty straightforward.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.880]   So we just pray alone, right?
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.920]   Wrong. (laughs)
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.800]   We don't only pray in secret, we pray together as well.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.680]   Something we see all over the book of Acts, for example,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.680]   in texts like Acts 2, 42, 431, 1212, 133, and 2036,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.720]   just to name a few texts.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.440]   So why do we pray together and not just alone?
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.600]   What's added when we pray together
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.360]   and what's lost when we only pray by ourselves?
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.960]   In 1981, Pastor John took up this very question
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.060]   in a sermon on 2 Corinthians 1, verses 8 to 11.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.600]   There, Paul writes his testimony of his agonies,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.120]   quote, "For we do not want you to be unaware,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.160]   brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.640]   for we were so bitterly burdened beyond our strength
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.960]   that we despaired of life itself.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100]   but that was to make us rely not on ourselves,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.920]   but on God who raises the dead.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.100]   He delivered us from such a deadly peril,
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800]   and he will deliver us.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.720]   On him, we have set our hope
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320]   that he will deliver us again," end quote.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.040]   And then Paul makes this request in verse 11,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.480]   which is a little complex, so listen carefully, quote,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.400]   "You also must help us by prayer
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.640]   so that many will give thanks on our behalf
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.640]   for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many,"
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   end quote.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.960]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.440]   - That's a hard verse.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   I noticed Glenn this morning,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   just like I, had trouble reading verse 11.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.600]   He had to stop and make sure he had it just right
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   because it's a very complex sentence.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.000]   I had to read verse 11 again and again,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   and I could not get the gist of verse 11
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.240]   until I drew it on paper.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   Now, follow with me the line of prayer.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.720]   Keep one eye on the text,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.880]   one eye on the line, and both ears on me.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   The line of prayer begins with Paul, and he feels a need.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.760]   That's where prayer begins.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   His need was probably,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920]   oh, how I need to rely on God more.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   Oh, how I need to trust God
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.200]   for deliverance from all my adversaries more.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720]   So what does he do?
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   He sends out a line of prayer.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.960]   Help me, horizontally, to the Corinthians.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.200]   Help me by prayer.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.360]   And that's stage one in the line of prayer.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.200]   Then the line of prayer curves up
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800]   through the heart of the Corinthians
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000]   as they hear the plea,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   and they look up to God
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   and pray that God will, in fact,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.240]   answer their prayers for Paul's deliverance
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.400]   and for his faith, and that's stage two,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.720]   the prayers of the Corinthians heading up to God.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.040]   Then the line of prayer enters the heart of God
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.840]   who is there listening,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   waiting for the prayers of his people.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   And in response to the prayers of the many Corinthians,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.440]   God sends down a gift or a blessing,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.480]   as the text says, to Paul.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.200]   What blessing?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.040]   Greater faith in God, greater dependence on him alone,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.000]   and deliverance from his adversaries.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.960]   And that's stage three in the line of prayer.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.680]   Help us by prayer, stage one.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.560]   God, help Paul, stage two.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.680]   God's answer, stage three.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   Now, just as many people heard the plea of Paul
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.680]   to help through prayer,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.240]   so many people now see the answer to the prayers.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.680]   As they look, look, Paul got out.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.360]   He got out of the Philippian jail.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.520]   He got away from Ephesus.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.720]   He made it all the way through Berea and Thessalonica.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.160]   He's coming down here to us.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.840]   He's gonna make it all the way to Jerusalem with that money.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.240]   He may make it to Rome, to the ends of the earth,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.640]   and preach to the emperor.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   Praise God.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.600]   And that's line four.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   They see, they see the answer to prayer,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.560]   and that curves up through their heart in praises
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   and thanksgiving through many people back to God.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   And that's stage five in the line of prayer.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.800]   And that's where the text stops.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   But I think there is something implied in the text
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.920]   that's not explicit,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.880]   that is just a choice truth that I don't wanna leave out.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   Namely, if Paul chose to motivate the Corinthians
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.000]   to pray for him by pointing out
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.920]   that it would abound in many thanksgivings to God,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.640]   then it must be a great delight to Paul
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.000]   to think about God getting so many thanks.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.800]   And if it's a great delight to Paul to see God being thanked,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.320]   then that little dotted line that comes down from God
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.120]   is joy coming back into the heart of Paul
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   as he sees God being thanked in response to many prayers,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   or the answer to many prayers.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.280]   So that's stage six that I've added.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400]   In fact, I could go on adding stage seven
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   because God gets delight in Paul's delight
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.400]   and Paul gets delight in God's delight and his delight.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   And it's just a great spiral on up into infinite joy someday
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.360]   when there's no more sin to clutter up that spiral.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.440]   That's the line of prayer.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.400]   Let me sum it up just briefly.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.480]   Paul has a great need and he feels it.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.200]   He knows he's coming into adversity.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.440]   He said in Acts 20, verse 23,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.320]   "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   "that afflictions and imprisonments await me."
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.360]   He needs help.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.600]   "Help me," Corinthians.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.800]   They hear the word.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.520]   "God, help Paul."
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.360]   God looks down.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.960]   "I hear the prayer.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.680]   "Here's the help, Paul."
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.720]   Paul is helped.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.560]   He's delivered.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.400]   He's free.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.240]   He's preaching.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.080]   He's full of faith.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.920]   Who sees it?
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920]   Lots of people see it.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.000]   What do they do?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.480]   Praise God.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.520]   God has responded to our prayers
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.400]   and the thanks go back to God and he's glorified.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.040]   That's the line of prayer.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.160]   That's what ought to be happening in this church
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   again and again and again.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   And there are more lessons in this
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.880]   than I can begin to say this morning,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.760]   but I want to mention two.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.200]   Two lessons from the line of prayer.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.800]   The first is this.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.240]   If you're like me, you've probably asked yourself
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.360]   why it is that corporate prayer is important.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   Why pray in groups?
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.280]   Why pray publicly?
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.520]   Why not just close the door,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.800]   like Jesus said we should many times,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.720]   and pray alone?
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.080]   Why does Paul not simply pray,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.280]   God save me from the enemies, God fill me with faith,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.680]   and not write letters and tell other people to pray for him?
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560]   Doesn't he think God can answer his prayer?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.960]   Is he lacking in faith?
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.120]   Are we weak in faith when we ask
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.760]   many people to pray for something?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.040]   That's the kind of question I came to this text with
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.280]   and I think the text gives a tremendous answer
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.080]   to why corporate and public prayer is so important.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.600]   Why might God be more inclined to answer
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.960]   the prayers of many
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.440]   rather than the prayers of one?
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.880]   That's my question.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   And I think the answer begins like this.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.760]   According to our text,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   the thing that's different when many people pray,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.000]   notice many prayers,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.600]   is that the stage is being set
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.120]   for lots and lots and lots of thanks.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.640]   The more people that are earnestly praying
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.440]   for some blessing from God,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.720]   the more thanksgiving will ascend to God
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.880]   when that blessing comes.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.320]   Paul's argument is very simply this.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.840]   You must help me by prayer
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   so that many will give thanks
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.200]   when the prayers of many are answered.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.080]   The reason for praying at all
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.880]   is so God might be thanked when blessings come.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   And God loves to be thanked.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.520]   God loves to be thanked.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.800]   And that's the basic premise here
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.520]   for why this prayer becomes so effective.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.440]   He loves to be acknowledged and praised
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.560]   as the giver of all good gifts.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.400]   Therefore, when we urge, when I urge you,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.720]   400 people say,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   when I urge you to pray for some need,
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.920]   many people,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.480]   I'm creating a situation
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.320]   in which the provision of that need
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.880]   will result in many, many, many thanksgivings,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.680]   more than if each of us was praying privately.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   And therefore, we tap into a tremendous incentive
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.160]   on God's part,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.000]   because God loves to glorify himself
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   by doing what he must do to get as many thanks as possible.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.400]   And that means answering the prayers of many people.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.720]   God loves to be thanked by many.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   And therefore, there is a power in church wide prayer,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.280]   because the more people there are praying
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.200]   for the spiritual life of our church,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.160]   the more thanksgiving will ascend when God gives it.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.960]   Now, the same reasoning,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.120]   which comes straight out of 2 Corinthians 1:11,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.000]   the same reasoning also shows
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.480]   that we should not only pray in large numbers,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   but that we should get together in groups to pray.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.320]   I'll try to show you how that follows.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.400]   Picture two possibilities.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   One would be a dozen people privately in their homes,
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.800]   praying for the release of Paul,
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.600]   say from jail in Philippi.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.000]   Okay?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.480]   They pray, God answers, delivers Paul.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.640]   They get word of it.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   They give thanks.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.960]   God is honored.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.280]   Great.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   But suppose that those dozen or so people met together
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.160]   in a group, in a room, in a living room there in Philippi,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.760]   just like the saints did in Acts 12
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.320]   to pray for Peter's release when he was in jail.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.520]   Suppose they got together and prayed.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.280]   And the fervor of each other's prayer
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.880]   kindled each other's fervor up to God.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.440]   God released Paul miraculously through this earthquake
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   and they hear about it.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.680]   Then what would happen?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.280]   The praises and the thanks would ascend.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.160]   And is it not human nature?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.720]   You see, if this isn't true to your own experience,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   is it not human nature to feel gratitude more intensely
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.320]   when somebody you love is sharing the experience
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.960]   with you?
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.840]   Is that not human nature to feel the joy of gratitude
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.040]   more intensely when someone you love
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.600]   is feeling it together with you?
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.480]   When you and I experience a blessing
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.240]   that we've asked for together,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   your thanksgiving deepens and heightens my thanksgiving
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.080]   because it works like this.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.960]   Now, this is true for me and I think it's human nature.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.720]   When the answer comes, I see the blessing coming from God.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.800]   I see it and I'm glad, I rejoice.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.680]   But then I look down and I see it reflected
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.880]   in all your faces, reflected and magnified.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.320]   And my joy therefore is compounded
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.280]   and my thanksgiving is greater.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.880]   And God loves heightened and deepened thanksgiving.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.800]   And therefore he wants us to meet in groups to pray.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.240]   And therefore we are setting ourselves up
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.160]   for tremendous spiritual blessing in this church
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.040]   when we gather in groups to seek God's blessing
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.360]   on our church.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.480]   - Yeah, a vivid explanation of how 2 Corinthians 1:11 works
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.760]   based on a flow chart of the text.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.520]   A clip taken from John Piper's sermon titled
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.160]   "The Line of Prayer" preached back on January 4, 1981.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.520]   I found this clip, but if you find one, email it to me.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.280]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.320]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.200]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.320]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.240]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.640]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.200]   Speaking of sermon clips, you might remember
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.760]   about a month ago, I shared with you a great sermon clip
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.200]   sent to us from a woman in Greece who struggled for years
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.800]   with an eating disorder and who only chose to open up
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.920]   and tell others about the sin
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.680]   after hearing a John Piper sermon clip
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.520]   on Romans 7, verses 14 to 25.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   That clip, that clip that changed her life was sent to us
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.300]   and we published it as APJ 1751 recently.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.760]   And while I was editing that clip,
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.120]   getting it ready for you all, I noticed that we've never
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   entered the debate over Romans 7 itself,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.720]   not here on the podcast.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.680]   So is Romans 7 the struggle of Christian Paul
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.600]   or of pre-Christian Saul?
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.080]   It's an important debate.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.240]   Pastor John has a position,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.420]   he believes it's the believer struggle
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.720]   and he will defend that position next time.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.160]   We're gonna actually get down into the nitty gritty
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.980]   of that text.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we are rejoined
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.600]   in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.480]   for that big debate.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
