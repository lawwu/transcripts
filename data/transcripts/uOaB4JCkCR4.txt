[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   He's very curious if you think the crazy professor phenomenon happened to Jordan Peterson and
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.280]   Brett Weinstein.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.280]   That's right.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.280]   That's right.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280]   All right.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.840]   So there's no way I'm going to get in trouble talking about this topic, right?
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.960]   No, you'll be fine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   So first of all, I forgot that I had called this phenomenon crazy professor phenomenon.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.000]   I don't know if that's a fair name, but for people who didn't hear me talk about that
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.560]   before, it was the idea that if you people like really smart people in academia, when
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.480]   they leave academia are more prone than the average person to end up in more eccentric
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.900]   or conspiratorial or like way out of the mainstream type of views.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.440]   And my argument was is because the fact you're in academic academia in the first place means
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.760]   that they typically have high octane minds.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.400]   They're used to this idea that they're smarter than a lot of people and can figure things
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.440]   out that other people can't.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.820]   But in academia, you have so many other minds pushing back on you.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.840]   It's hard to get too weird, right?
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.200]   Because people you also respect and fear intellectually are going to be like, that's nonsense.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440]   I'm not going to put all my money in the gold, et cetera.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.440]   When you leave academia, you lose that feedback buffer.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.640]   And so you're much more likely to end up in weird places because you're intellectually
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.620]   confident and you're intellectually curious, but you don't have the dampers.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.800]   So Jeffrey's asking, do I think that happened to Jordan Peterson or Brett Weinstein?
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800]   I think it's Weinstein, right?
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   Or Weinstein.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   I think it's Weinstein, like Einstein.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   If I'm getting that wrong, Brett, big apologies.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.920]   So in his case, I think some of that might have happened.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.320]   So if people don't know, Brett and his wife, Heather Herring, I believe, they were in academia.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.440]   They were biologists, did a lot of stuff on evolutionary theory.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.280]   They're at Evergreen University, which is I think a state university, a public university
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520]   in Oregon or Washington state.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.240]   It's very progressive, has these very progressive educational models where you, I don't quite
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   get how it works, but the classes are done in a sort of like really interesting kind
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.280]   of unusual way.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.960]   And they got into like some sort of cancellation issue there.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040]   And it really got out of control where like students were roaming the campus looking for
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   them and maybe even like physically threatening them.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.440]   But long story short, they had to leave, they left academia.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   And so I think it's a mixed bag.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.600]   Again, I don't know a ton about them.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.560]   I know they have a new book out that sort of seems completely mainstream.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.600]   It has to do about what you can learn from evolutionary theory and the history of our
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.960]   species about modern life, like sort of down the middle.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.200]   But I do think Brett went to some weird places with COVID during the pandemic that felt a
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680]   little bit like this phenomenon when I'd sample in a show here and there where there's just
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.080]   like a lot of confidence on something that was very much out of the mainstream and did
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   not in the end turn out to be at all really kind of right.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.240]   There was a lot of this sort of confident out of the mainstream, a couple of places
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   like that he felt.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.120]   So I think that's probably a great example of that effect in action is because it's this
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.620]   very smart guy and Heather's very smart.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.720]   And so it completely makes sense in their minds that we can kind of see something that's
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.920]   not widely recognized now.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.440]   So maybe that's an example of it.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.760]   Jordan Peterson, I think it's a much harder case.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   It's much harder to assess here.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.080]   So the Peterson had been on my radar for a long time before he became a big public figure,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.760]   because again, when I would do student advice, I would occasionally hear from students who
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.440]   would talk about Dr. Peterson, especially students who were like first generation college
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.680]   students, students of color found a lot out of a lot good in his work.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.840]   He's like a mentor like figure for a lot, a lot of people.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.520]   And so it was kind of on my radar.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   He's a weird character.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.600]   Like the thing to understand about Jordan Peterson that I think not a lot of people
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.520]   in just the non-academic world understand is that he's a, he's an unusual character.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.480]   He came out of what was like essentially the Canadian version of like West Texas, right?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.720]   The sort of ranch country in the middle of Canada, a very cold kind of rough place comes
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   out of there.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   So with no really a leader academic background and is like a, an incandescent star within
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   academia.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.480]   I mean, he goes, he ends up at Harvard as a young professor where he's tenured in the
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.840]   psychology department.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.520]   Harvard does not tenure from within very often in psychology.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.720]   I mean, he was like a, this guy was seen as this bright star, you Toronto bottom away,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   right?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.200]   Like, come, we're going to make you an offer.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   You can't refuse.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.760]   So he was like a superstar academic who had came out of nowhere, like not at all of an
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   environment where you would expect to have, have a mind like that.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.800]   So he was sort of this, I think that's often missed.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.080]   I think for those who dislike him, it's more comfortable, this idea that he's, it's sort
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   of like a grifter type guy.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.880]   That's the sort of like spouting off wisdom and, and you know, like obviously me as a
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   reporter, much smarter than this guy.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.560]   No, he was an incandescent star, like sort of out of the ranches of Canada.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.280]   But from what I understand, it's, it's hard to talk about this phenomenon with him because
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.720]   he always was sort of a loner and a little bit eccentric, even when he was in academia.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.680]   I think because of this unusual background, he came, got out of, and this is secondhand,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.480]   but I think he was again, already didn't really care about what the feedback was from colleagues
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   or whatever.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.680]   I don't know if that's true, but I I've heard some things like that.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.600]   So it's hard to say, you know, when he left academia and then, then of course you have
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.120]   this other confusing factor, confounding factor of the huge celebrity and the huge detraction
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.000]   that occurred when he became a public figure, the warping effect of that on someone has
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.560]   to be so powerful that it's going to swamp out any signal we're going to get about just,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   well, when he left academia, he may be without this type of cognitive structure and feedback,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.080]   maybe got a little bit more eccentric.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:10.640]   How could we separate that signal from the crushing, completely unbearable, completely
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.600]   unusual worldwide phenomenon and attacks?
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.960]   I mean, that had to have such a bigger impact on his life, his mental life than the changing
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.800]   his context of being academia or not that, that, that must swamp out that signal.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.820]   So because of those two confounding factors, I can't tell what change leaving academia
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.820]   had on Peterson.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.160]   So to summarize, he already was really iconoclastic and eccentric when he was in academia.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.000]   And two, there's too many other things happened to him right when he left the, I can't pull
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   apart.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.840]   I can't pull apart those pieces.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   So there you go.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.640]   Though I don't like crazy professor phenomenon.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   I don't think that's a good title.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.840]   I should, I didn't realize I called it that before.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   I'll have to come up with a better title, but again, it's very consistent though.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.900]   Folks who leave academia, they usually have a lot of medical breakthroughs.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.800]   They get become masters of finances.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.280]   Like I can understand the financial system.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.200]   And to get, and I don't want to go off on this, but like also like media criticism becomes
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   a big thing.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   Because again, if you're like Brett Weinstein, you're a really smart guy and you get kind
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.400]   of resentful against some reporters.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   You're like, I'm just smarter than you and you annoy me.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.080]   And like, then you get really angry at the media and it's a, it's a whole interesting
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   thing.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.640]   So if I ever left Georgetown, Jesse, you'd have to stop me from becoming like very conspiratorial
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.200]   and offering a lot of medical advice and financial advice and just attacking the media all the
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   time.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.320]   Though we'd probably get more subscribers.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   So
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   [inaudible]
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   [inaudible]
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   [inaudible]
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   [inaudible]
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.020]   (upbeat music)
