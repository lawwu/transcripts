[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Well, hi, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of The Everyday Educator. I am so
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.600]   excited. I was literally just saying to Amy Jones, who's here with me today, that I'm
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.980]   so excited about this conversation because I think it's really going to stretch me. And
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.820]   I'm hopeful that as you hear and feel me stretch into the topic of science, that that encourages
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.600]   you today. So I just want to remind you before we get started, if you're not a part of a Classical
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.240]   Conversations community, that really is the best place for you to go to learn more about
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.500]   how to homeschool, to learn more about what it's like to classically Christian educate your
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780]   child. And so we want to encourage you to definitely find that in-person community. And you can find
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.380]   that online at classicalconversations.com. But without any further ado, I've got Amy Jones
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.860]   in the house. Amy, hi. Hi. It's good to be here. And this is my favorite topic. So thanks
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.980]   for inviting me. This is going to be so fun. I know you're probably not new to say 85% of
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.900]   our listeners, because we have you on here a lot. But just in case they don't know who
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.980]   you are, what you do, will you just introduce yourself to everyone?
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.940]   Oh, sure. My name is Amy Jones. I live here in Tennessee with my husband. And we have four
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.140]   children. And I call them three bonus children. Three of my children are married. And we have
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.840]   just, they have lovely families. And we have nine, soon to be 10 grandchildren. So they keep
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.120]   us busy. And fortunately, they're within an hour or so of our house. So we get to pester
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.160]   them as much as we want. It's really fun. And we homeschooled our kids. The very beginning,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.680]   when my oldest was, I think when they're born, you start homeschooling, don't you? And then all
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   the way through my, our youngest son just graduated from, oh goodness, college a couple of years ago.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.680]   And he's just finished his first year of med school. So hooray for him. Many prayers,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480]   many prayers. So we were just delighted to be able to have the privilege of homeschooling
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.640]   and just being with each other, the ups and downs, you know, the bumps and bruises, but just
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.160]   lots of laughter. And, and what I was reflecting on today was that we, um, we still have those
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.660]   conversations. Hmm. You know, the ones that you had around the table that your mom brought you
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.440]   together and you talked about, we still have those conversations. So it doesn't end. So yeah.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.160]   Well, that's encouraging to hear because, you know, I think sometimes parents do worry and you never
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.060]   know how your life is going to turn out, but we worry that we're going to invest so much on the front
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.460]   end. And then our children are just going to want to run out that door. You know, we let them go
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.140]   and they don't want to come back. But the fact that you've cultivated a community within your family,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.820]   where you have good conversations, it's just beautiful because of course they would long for
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.340]   that. So they do come back. Um, and I love that they live so close to you so you can go to them.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:16.020]   Well, today, as I said earlier, we're going to talk all about science specifically during the summer.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.940]   you can, of course, apply the ideas that we talk all year long, but, um, the ideas that we discuss
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:30.260]   all year long. But right now we want to talk about what it looks like to lean into science activities,
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.500]   scientific exploration with your children during the summertime. And I'd love for you to just take us
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.940]   on a trip down memory lane, Amy and tell us maybe what, what did that look like for you and your family
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.420]   when your kids were growing up? Oh, that's such a good question. Um, yeah, I think every season and, uh,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.060]   the season from spring to summer is always the most dramatic for kids because usually if you're not
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.140]   homeschooling year round, that's like, we're free, you know, and mom's like, we're free, I'm free.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:11.860]   So that transition to summer was always much anticipated and there were countdowns and all
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.700]   sorts of things that our children did. So, um, it was, uh, summer is a nice season for us. We live
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.220]   in Tennessee so we can play outside. And that was really the focus. Summer is more relaxed. It's a
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.620]   more relaxed time. It's, and I would just encourage parents, especially to take that time to relax. Um,
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.140]   sometimes I would, as the children get older, I would say, Oh, we're going to finish up whatever,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.620]   like math or that, or that stack of books we didn't get through. I would really encourage moms not to do
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:56.100]   that. Um, because we all need kind of a, a hard stop in places and we need a good start in places.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.100]   And I felt like when I tried to kind of weasel in those extra lessons that it just felt kind of
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:14.100]   deflating instead of we need to rejuvenate, we need to reflect and be revitalized. And there's no better
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.380]   place to do that than in God's creation. And so I had really active three active sons and a very active
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:31.380]   daughter. So we spent time outside, um, and, uh, on walks or going to the pool or even when it gets
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.100]   really hot, the library, just really taking some time to, um, explore some of those areas that we
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:48.180]   didn't get to do during what we call the school year. So I would really encourage, um, a mom to a,
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.660]   not feel guilty to really reflect on all that God has done in their school year, and then make that
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.140]   transition to a restful summer. Um, so I think in both you and your husband, I think that's a really
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.780]   great conversation to have, you know, like go out to dinner and just reflect on all that God has done.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.300]   Don't make plans, you know, that's not a business meeting, um, but just reflect and then delight in,
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.820]   um, okay, I have this time. And you might also just, I, it was helpful for me to go, we stop at this date
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:30.660]   date and we start at this date. So I could tell, okay, here's the free space. I had one child that
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:39.620]   always wanted to know, when do we have to go back and go, well, it's not tomorrow. So, so I would just
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   definitely encourage you to enjoy this change of season and, uh, and rest and reflect. So celebrate.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.820]   That's, yeah, that's such great advice. I think more and more I've heard people talk about what
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.540]   they call the summer slide. We just did another episode on reading with Kelly Wilt and she was
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.420]   talking about the summer slide. I'm like, see, I'm hearing it everywhere. Everybody is concerned
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.060]   about this idea of their children forgetting everything during the summertime. And while,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.780]   yeah, you want to keep your kids learning and that's important. I do think you just hit on such,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:26.340]   such a kingdom principle of rhythms of rest and work. And it, I think we just need to be aware
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:32.820]   as believers that that is a place that maybe the enemy is trying to steal from us and, and sort of
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.780]   make us think that we have to, we have to work first to get our rest when actually the pattern of the entire
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:48.100]   universe, like from creation on is he rested and then he worked. And so he has us starting,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.820]   starting from that posture. And really that's a way that we show our reliance on him and our trust in
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.700]   him. And what you just said, we're able to reflect and rejoice and celebrate all that God has done and
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.420]   to realize that, you know, of course we're trying to be diligent and faithful and there's a place for
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:14.180]   that. Um, but also the harvest comes from the one who sits on the throne. So I really love that you
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.900]   brought that into the conversation from the onset, because I think it's important for us to remember,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:25.540]   regardless of what we're trying to encourage our families to learn or glean, that we can do that
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:34.020]   from a place of rest and, um, and it'll be more fulfilling if we do that. Um, and I think we know that in some
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.260]   areas of our life, but when it comes to education, we just feel like.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.780]   We just feel the right of it.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.940]   Yeah, it feels huge.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:48.820]   As, as my children got older, I feel like it was really important now that they're, they're married and have
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.940]   their own children, um, that it's really important as a mom that you're modeling that faith of rest.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:02.340]   I think it's an act of faith and that God is going to take care of us. And instead I thought,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:10.020]   I just didn't want to inflict my anxiety on them. And then they feel sort of trapped like, oh, mom's not
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:18.340]   happy instead of just giving them the gift of rest and giving them that permission. I mean, do you,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.700]   I remember I had a grandmother and I would work close near, near home and have lunch with her.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.500]   And she would say, now you just go lay down on that bed and take a little nap. And I thought
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:35.300]   it was funny because I was in high school. I didn't really need a nap, but what she gave me was permission
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:43.060]   to rest. You need to rest. And I think we need to give ourselves permission, but I think it's really
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:49.540]   important to model for your children. You can rest. And because they're going to have children,
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:58.020]   hopefully one day, and you don't want them to be feeling like this loaded burden of we've got to
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.540]   always be producing something that that's not true. Yeah. The enemy wants to steal that from us. Yes.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.620]   It's not true. And just as you say that you're making me think of this quote, you know, Lisa Bailey,
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:16.260]   the other host of this show. And she sent me this quote in the light of our conversation that I think
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:24.980]   just encapsulates what you said perfectly. This is by Mr. Fred Rogers. He says, "It seems to me that some
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:33.380]   of us value information over wonder and noise over silence. And I feel that we need a lot more wonder
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.740]   and a lot more silence in our lives." That's nice.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:44.660]   And when we're thinking about science, it's true that some of the greatest discoveries come
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:53.300]   from those places of rest, from those places of silence and wonder and sitting back and observing.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.220]   So as we dive into this conversation, the first thing I would love to hear you define is just,
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.980]   what is science? This conversation could go so many different directions from your perspective.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.460]   What does it look like? What is science? How would you describe that?
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:15.540]   Well, the word science means knowledge, but it's much more than that. First of all, God created science.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:23.460]   He's the originator of all this. All that we know, both visible and invisible,
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:35.220]   was in the mind of God from the beginning. And as he made creation, spoke these words that brought light
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:44.340]   and brought dry land and plants and animals. It's so incredible. And he was thinking in his mind as he
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:51.940]   is hiding treasures that we are going to find. That's science. It's engaging with the natural world
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:58.100]   that God has made, whether it's a physics world or a biology world or a botany world. It doesn't
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.860]   matter. We, we make those distinctions. Um, but all of that is our invitations for understanding him.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:13.780]   And that's what his, his purpose is, is that we're going to understand his nature and his power. And so
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:24.260]   looking for God in his creation is, is really the, is science that is the study of God's creation. Um,
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.060]   and to realize that he's the originator and what we know about him, since we know how wonderful he is
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:38.660]   and creative and subtle and humorous, since we know that all about him, then the, then everything we
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:46.580]   discover gives us another insight into his nature. So I just think it's, I, I used to, I don't, you know,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:54.260]   we categorize science in, in schools, you know, you do science and you do math, but I think that again,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:01.300]   that's a false, um, a false category. I think, um, we live and breathe in this world and that's where
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:07.380]   science is. So, so it's just recognizing that it's just looking around and going, Oh, and asking,
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:16.660]   huh, I wonder. Uh huh. Uh huh. I couldn't agree with you more. Yeah. And it, you know, it's so funny
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.820]   because I came into this particular conversation thinking and, you know, preparing for it thinking,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.580]   okay, let's talk about plants and animals and nature walks. And, you know, and just to be transparent
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:35.300]   with everyone, I was a child who was a little bit resistant and I'm not sure why we could dig into
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   that, but we won't right now. I was a little bit resistant to what people typically called quote
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:48.500]   science. I just didn't science and math. Those are two areas where I just felt, you know, I don't know
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.660]   if I care. I don't know if I'm interested and I certainly don't like the way you're presenting it,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:01.860]   you know, so let's move on type thing. And so, um, while I was preparing for this conversation,
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.740]   it was easy for me to assume that I fully understood all the ways that you could
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.900]   scientifically explore. Cause I have a college degree and I've done chemistry and I've done,
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.780]   you know, all of these different things. And then I thought to myself, well, you know what,
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:26.340]   I think I do science all the time in my garden when I cook dinner and when I, when I study my
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:33.060]   child, you know, I'm so fascinated by neurological development and I absolutely love thinking about
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:39.700]   the way that people interact and how, what portions of that are, are actually attached to their biology
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:45.300]   and what portions of that are shifting because of where they are like that nurture nature conversation.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.420]   But there's a lot to that or psychology, like that's a type of science. I really love that.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.500]   And so I, I want to encourage our listeners to think outside the box. I mean, yes, we want you to go outside.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.420]   There's a lot to that. Um, and we're going to talk about some things you can do outside.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:08.740]   Also, if you have a child who maybe has an unconventional love of science, encourage that
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:16.500]   too, because yeah, they could find that in, in a place that you wouldn't expect. Um, and, and that
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:23.140]   too reveals back to what you were just saying, God's nature and his power. That's why I love learning
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:29.620]   about the brain so much. I think God is brilliant. He is brilliant. And the fact that he planted so many
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:36.980]   of these things that, that some people discovered and some people never do in the body, it blows my
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:43.300]   mind. You can hear I'm speechless. So that's where we end up. And, and you're exactly right, Delisa.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.580]   Sometimes, um, other science, you know, when we think of, oh, like botany or maybe chemistry,
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:53.940]   we should start going into chemistry. And it's really, you just think of it as like,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.740]   you just moved into a new country. You're just learning a new language, like chemistry.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:04.820]   The reason that I think we get put off by different science subjects is we haven't learned that
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:10.100]   language. And, and no one taught us that, you know what, this is just unfamiliar to you.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.620]   You just don't know it yet. And actually, you know, a lot more than you think, you know,
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:21.780]   you know, because if you've ever dissolved, you know, made a cup of tea, you you've done some
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.860]   physical science. If you've ever like, you know, scrubbed your bathtub with, with comet, you've,
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:35.700]   you've done some chemistry, you know, you, you are already familiar. There's no, there is no area of
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.900]   science that you as a human being have not experienced. And when you drink out of a straw,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:47.140]   you've just made physics because you've lowered the pressure, you know, it's, you just don't know what it is.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:55.780]   And so I think that I think it's unfortunate that science in our, in our public school or modern
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:02.980]   education disconnects us from the, from the world. We are in labs or on the, in the classroom and we're
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:12.260]   reading books. So we don't see that integration of, in our natural life with the subject. And that's true.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:18.820]   And I think with people who love like are drawn to literature or, um, or words, it's because we're
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:25.300]   so much more familiar with words. We use language all the time. So it's a familiar world. So yeah,
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:33.220]   I think it, it does. Um, once you're sort of past that, but I'll tell you that your children don't know
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:40.020]   that they've never been to high school. Your children don't know that. So they just think the world is like
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.980]   like a playground of science. They don't have any categories. So you are the one that will change.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:54.020]   So they think it's delightful and you'll go, well, I never thought about that, you know? So it's,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.540]   it's nice. It's nice.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:03.460]   It's so, that's so true. And I think the caution or the encouragement for me and for us as, as parents is
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:09.860]   for us to not squash it, you know, just like stand back and don't squash it. If you're not excited,
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:17.220]   that's fine. Let them be excited about the bug. Let them want to take their time to ask more questions
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:24.900]   about the thing. Don't, don't project your own feelings, you know, or maybe past experiences on them,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:34.500]   because it's true that I landed on that perspective because of my experiences, but he has experiences
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.780]   and I want them to be positive ones. And so, um, in the, and at the end of the day, we are all trying
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:45.540]   to get the same place, which is to know God and to make him known. So science is an area where I want
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:54.180]   him to feel that he's done that. What makes the summer, Amy, just so uniquely ripe for scientific
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:01.860]   exploration? Oh, well, things are growing all over the place. So we are looking, life is around us and
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:11.220]   it's the dormant winter has passed. Um, days are longer. The sun is in the sky. We get to go outside.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:17.940]   The skies are beautiful in the evening. There are meteorite showers in August. So you can go and
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:24.020]   hope to find one, or if you don't, it was fun to try. Um, there are all sorts of activities that are
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:30.820]   going on in the summer, like at national parks or in your, um, in your community that invites you to be
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:38.980]   outside. Um, so I would say that I, I say outside because it just lends itself. Now I would say you should
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:47.540]   be outside all the year round, but because the, of the climate and because of that relaxed feel that
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:56.980]   we have in the summer, it's inviting for that reason. Also, you can, um, do a lot of science that
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:04.500]   you may not have been able to do in outside during the winter. You can, I like, especially like with
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:12.100]   growing things and looking at critters and watching birds. There's just so much life going on outside.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:20.020]   So that's what makes science a lot of fun in, in the summertime. And also, uh, honestly, if you are a
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.380]   little more relaxed with your summer schedule, which I really hope you are, that you can start doing some
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:33.700]   things, bringing nature inside and giving time to observe and reflect. So allowing,
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:41.300]   like you were saying that quiet or restful time, you're usually, um, our summers weren't just chock
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:48.020]   full of like, you know, soccer practice and piano and all that kind of thing, uh, that we had a
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:55.540]   little more flexibility. So not to fill up their days with activity, but, but to really utilize some
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:02.500]   of that downtime to go, okay, we're going to, and just think of something that you maybe recognize.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.420]   Like, is there something that they kind of were stirred in their heart? Like we had one of my
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:15.860]   children really got into bonsai trees. Now I'm not sure why. Um, so we didn't have any bonsai trees
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:24.100]   growing around. It takes like 30 years to have a very long time, but we had a ton of these little tiny,
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:32.580]   um, plant things of, of evergreen bushes that look like bonsai trees. So we dug up all sorts of things
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.660]   and brought them in the house and we planted them. And so look for adventures and listen for what
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:47.300]   your child, uh, for what that brings about that curiosity. You know, um, also, if you think about,
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:55.540]   like, if you're around any of the water, like ponds or lakes or rivers, um, those are great. It's a great
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:05.380]   time to go explore along the shore and put, you know, um, look under rotted, you know, wood and
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:12.180]   scrape off bark. Yeah. Be, um, I think just really, it's a great time to engage with the natural world
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.820]   because you have a little extra time and because, um, it's, it's, it's just inviting you. Everything's
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:26.100]   green. I don't know about where you are, but everything here is green. So it's welcoming you
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:32.260]   into that world. So yeah, I would think definitely for summer, that's a, it's a great time to take
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:38.740]   advantage of that. Absolutely. It's a huge invitation. And you know, I'm, I'm in North Carolina as well,
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.380]   but I think about people who live in Arizona, there's something else inviting you there, you know,
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:50.020]   so wherever you are there, there is an invitation. And the question is, are you coming? You know,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.700]   like, are you answering the invitation? And I love that you said, look for adventures. That's such a
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:04.660]   beautiful way to, to think about it. And it is so full of wonder. And, you know, we say here a lot at
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.660]   classical conversations that the world life is a treasure hunt and it's because it is, there's actually
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.700]   something to be discovered. It's not that we're out there wondering, hoping that we're going to
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.220]   stumble on something. God says that if we seek him, we'll find him when we search for him with all of
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:29.140]   our hearts. So there's that sense of assurance that we have, which is really encouraging when we look for
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.140]   him in the natural world or we look for him in our math or wherever, whatever we're saying, whatever we're
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.660]   doing to know that he wants to be found by us. I think it's really, that's really beautiful. It's
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.260]   really cool to know. One of the things that is helpful is just spend some time in prayer for your
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:54.660]   family. Like what are some things that maybe they really stump struggled with this past year? You know,
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:02.740]   maybe there's an area that, um, didn't come as naturally and, um, or they didn't feel as invited
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:10.100]   to the table. I think of it that way, um, to think, okay, what are some things Lord that, and he is so
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:17.300]   good about giving you, um, good ideas for your kids. What are some things that we could do this summer
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:24.260]   that really, um, ignite, um, ignite that curiosity again? And, um, and then just watch and wait,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:31.300]   because I do think that, that all our kids is, you know, none of them are the same and they have their
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:40.500]   own unique pers, uh, perspective on the world. And just, just be sure to be aware of that. Like there's
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   some children are like little magnets. They're like drawn to different things. So just watch that and just,
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:55.380]   and, and really feed, um, use the summer as an opportunity to, to bolster, um, some confidence
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:03.060]   and some love and delight and, and uncover some passions that you didn't realize when in the midst
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:09.380]   of such a busy year. So it's also a summer is a good time for you as a parent and your, and your husband,
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:15.700]   of course, to look and recognize, oh, here's, here's a little love and, and let's, let's feed
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.620]   that. So, and science to me is a natural place or the world is a natural place for that to happen.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:29.380]   So that's a great encouragement. Yeah. Our little guy right now is very into drawing. And even to the
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:35.060]   point where I was in the adult nonfiction picking up a book, I think I was on the cooking aisle or so I'm
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:41.140]   looking on one side and he's looking on the other side and he pulls out a book on drawing and it was
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.260]   drawing superheroes because he's that passionate about it that he just naturally grabs this one.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.060]   He says, can I please get this? And of course I can't tell you no, you know, but it's, it's true
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.900]   that there is that invitation to feed their curiosity and to encourage, to nurture their love of, of
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:03.060]   learning. Um, especially in the summertime when you have a little bit more margin. I know some,
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:09.620]   some, some parents who were just having this conversation, um, a couple of weeks ago are
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:18.740]   hesitant to lean in to scientific exploration because of the mess. And a lot of parents will
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.660]   say, and we love and are thankful that community is a great place for you to go. They will say,
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:32.100]   hey, we only do science and community because I don't want to do the dissections. I don't want to
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:38.820]   do X, Y, Z. Um, and it smells, you know, if you're going to order a dissection kit, we're going to
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:44.500]   definitely honor the fact that it's going to be a mess. But how would you speak to a mom who really
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.340]   finds herself recoiling when she thinks about science because of the mess?
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:55.940]   Oh, oh, how would, well, I kind of lived on the proverb. Um, I think it's Proverbs 14, four,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:04.740]   where it says where there's no oxen in the crib, it's clean, but much increase. Oh, see, let me think
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:12.340]   if I can, if I can think about it. Much increase is by the strength of the ox. Okay. So basically that
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:20.820]   sounds really weird, but basically what that means, if you, uh, an empty, uh, stall is perfectly clean,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:28.340]   it doesn't, doesn't get dirty at all. But in order to have, um, something productive,
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:36.580]   in order to have something that brings about some kind of like an ox works hard and produces something
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.900]   from the hard work that you're going to have a messy stall. So you can have a super neat house.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.100]   And really by this time, if you're homeschooling, you, you probably should be over that by now.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:57.380]   If you have any children in the house for a long period of time, um, that that's past your past that,
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:05.140]   but I would just say, um, a couple of things. First of all, I would just, um, section off an area
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:12.500]   of your home. That's a, that all you need is a table that you can get beat up on. I would say
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:20.420]   a box of stuff that you're going to use. And I use, um, like a tray, like if you have a plastic tray with a
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:26.980]   lip and usually you can find them at the dollar store, you know, something, a serving tray. And that's
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:33.940]   like your, that's like a place where you put your specimens. So whenever you drag in from the outside,
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:41.060]   just stick it on the tray and, and put it in a place. If it, if it, um, put it in a place that's
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:47.300]   a way, if it bothers you, you know, put it in another room, but make a space in your home that it's really
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:56.580]   okay. And, and I think also allow for that exploration. I think part of what I struggle with is I
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:04.100]   would get this big elaborate, um, uh, experiment together and, you know, last like three minutes.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.540]   And then, and then they would all, and they'd be kind of bored and they'd be like, okay, is that it?
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:15.140]   You know? And you go like, oh, I spent like $500, not really, you know, I spent time and I wrote,
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.660]   you know, went to Amazon and I read a book and, and now it's like, you know, it's like making a really
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:27.940]   nice meal and they just kind of go, I don't like, you know, steak. Um, so I would say, keep it really
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:35.220]   simple for yourself and allow them to take some initiative in that, you know, all of this is
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:41.380]   training. So if, if it gets really messy, well, now part of the deal is, uh, one of our rules in our
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:49.460]   home was you do not cause unnecessary work for others. So, so when you're finished doing science,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:57.860]   part of science being a good, uh, lab partner is cleaning it up is restoring order. So it doesn't
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:04.420]   have to be chaotic. So use things around your house. You don't have to get new stuff, put, um, create a
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:10.340]   space that it's okay, that you might have a little scientist that, that lingers on that, at that table,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:18.980]   and then make sure that you practice the good habit of, of setting things up and putting things away.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:24.580]   And if you want, you want, I used to have just a cardboard boxes that things that had a label,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.180]   stick it all in here. And, um, and so that's what I would just say and just give it a shot. You know,
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.380]   the, um, the messiness is nothing, but, but if you, if your goal is to have a clean house,
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.580]   I don't even know if homeschooling is for you.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:47.780]   It's just, you just can't. I'm a mom of three boys. Forget it.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.300]   I just, you just give up. I mean, you just, well, I mean, you just have an, or I guess what I would say
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:59.460]   is there's an order to your home that's lovely and inviting, but then there is that,
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:08.580]   uh, clean, you know, you know what I mean? That he kind of, if we, you know, things are out of order,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:15.300]   uh, I, you know, something's off then that that's a little, that, that doesn't work very well. So,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:22.260]   and also remember that my home is not my home. It's everyone. So it's, that's good. So.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:28.820]   Hey everybody. We want to interrupt the show to let you know that national memory master and national
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:37.300]   commencement are moving to the classical conversations, family cruise in 2026. That's right.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:45.140]   This cruise isn't just about celebrating CC graduates and memory masters. It's about all CC families. You
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:51.540]   you can connect with CC leaders and families at all sages in their journey and turn education into a
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:58.420]   memorable family adventure. As you explore the Bahamas aboard Royal Caribbean's freedom of the seas,
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:06.340]   Check out our landing page to find out more at classical conversations.com forward slash cruise dash
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.500]   2026. Let's get back to the show. We hope to see you there.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.900]   That's so good. I feel like you,
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:19.940]   you may or may not realize the nuggets that you're dropping to the next generation, but let me just let you know,
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:28.100]   these are things that the moms who are coming behind you need to hear. Um, because, because we live in a
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:34.420]   Pinterest generation and we live in a social media generation. And so what we think we see of other
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:41.460]   people's homes isn't how their homes look, but that's our perception. So we're thinking, okay, what's wrong with
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:48.420]   me? Why is my house always a mess? You know, why can we not get it together? What's wrong with our
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:54.500]   routines? All of these false narratives that are being perpetuated by what we see. Like, and the truth
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:01.620]   is it's a picture. It's a real picture. Half of them now with AI, you know, are real pictures. So we're not
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:08.100]   basing it off of nothing, but it's still just a false expectation. And what you made me think of,
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.900]   I'll never forget hearing a dad say, he was talking about his lawn and you know,
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:20.500]   men tend to be very, um, attached to their lawn. And he said that he had to kind of let that go for
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:27.780]   a while because he said, look, I can either raise grass or I can raise my boys. And right now I'm raising
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:34.660]   boys and later I'll raise this grass. Yes. And that's kind of, I mean, obviously restoring order
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:41.780]   and being respectful and having a routine and a plan has its place in this conversation,
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:49.220]   but knowing what's more valuable, um, is the key. And that's what I'm hearing from you. So I just,
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.100]   I love what you shared and I'm just telling you, that's what we need to hear because you would be
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.660]   surprised. I've spoken to many parents with all age children who said, I'm quoting them exactly what I
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:08.180]   just said. Um, so you know, what are some unconventional ways to, to integrate science
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:14.420]   into our, our daily rhythms? How can we make this not an extra thing?
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:20.980]   Oh yeah. Uh, well, I think part of it is asking the Lord to open your eyes, your own eyes, you know,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:28.740]   just attending to things and, and just asking questions out loud and, um, and then being grateful, like,
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:35.620]   okay, for example, um, you might say, you know, it's funny that, uh, you know, if you're mixing your
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.420]   iced tea, this sugar never just, have you noticed that sugar doesn't dissolve here, but
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:46.340]   when I have my hot tea, it's fine. I wonder why that's the truth. And why is it that my nose gets
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:53.540]   itchy when I go outside or how does, how does soap work? Do you know how soap works? I don't know how
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   soap works. You know, just getting them like, did you notice that ice, when you put in a glass of water,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:04.740]   water, it floats. Now that's funny because most things you put in water sink. I wonder why that's
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:12.820]   true, you know, or have you tried, try to drink out of a straw and now let's put a hole in it,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:22.500]   or is it this? I think just breath, just at breakfast, there's like a million things that are going on
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:30.980]   in a very scientific way. Yeah. And, um, that we just do like, why does toast turn brown?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:38.500]   Do you know why toast turns brown? I think just having questions about things and being,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.100]   and asking the Lord to really ignite your own curiosity about the world and just ask questions.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.820]   You don't have to know the answers and you don't even have to, please don't spend hours finding.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:59.940]   Yeah. Well, let's try it out or ask your kids, listen for them. And, and if, when they notice
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:07.540]   something go, you know, what do you notice and listen for them? Like mom, why, you know,
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:15.700]   why does this work or how does this work? Um, we always had, you know, people, kids that tinkered,
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:23.460]   like giving them opportunities to just roll a ball around the house or make a ramp or, and just,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:29.380]   I think for me, it was noticing the natural world that was around me, whether it was in my kitchen
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:35.220]   or at my back door, it didn't matter because there are wonders everywhere. And there, and there are
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:42.180]   questions that I don't know the answer to that are fairly complicated. Like why I floats is a very
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:49.780]   complicated. It took people a long time to figure that out. And so I think just even showing your
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:57.620]   children that it it's science. I just keep thinking science, but the world is accessible to you.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:06.020]   And the world is an invitation by God to you to ask questions. And some of your children are good
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.660]   question askers. They're going to always, you know, you have that one, but why, but why, but why?
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:17.540]   And some are just going to be more introspective, but you can be a good question asker and, and notice.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:24.180]   And, uh, you don't, that's not a lab. Breakfast isn't a lab, but it can be a lab. So I just
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:31.140]   noticing and integrating, you know, um, and then just saying, Hey, let's, let's look at that. I'm
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:37.220]   curious. What are you curious about? I think part of the things that excited me is that I think, well,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:45.060]   gee, I don't know. I think it's kind of cool that, um, that the tea bag turns the whole thing
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:50.980]   brown. How does that work? You know, how fast can it go? Does the water have to be super hot
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:57.380]   or can it be cold or why does it change? I just, you know, kind of shoving the kids aside and say,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:03.060]   no, let me figure it out. No, let me see. Let me see. Give me one. You have yours and I'll do this.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:12.980]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. And you're making me think of my sister-in-law. I'm the third of four
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.460]   children. So I have a lot of, you know, people who've gone before me who are still in close
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:23.300]   proximity to me. And my sister-in-law would always tell me, Oh, it's just baby science whenever the
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:30.820]   kids are doing things. And I loved that phrase because I never, I never had, had anyone describe
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:38.740]   to me the things that an infant does as science, but it is. And if you're watching them and you're
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.780]   paying attention to the way that they're exploring, sometimes that kid dropping the thing on the floor
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:49.060]   over and over and over again has absolutely nothing to do with them teasing you, or that's part of the
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:56.420]   science experience. They're testing something. They're trying to figure out what velocity, you know, like
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:02.740]   which one is flying down faster and why. And when they're, they seem to be making a mess and they spread
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:08.660]   something out all over the floor. They want to know how far does it go? They have a question.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:14.500]   And even when your children are small and they can't necessarily articulate the question, I think
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:21.460]   it's easy for us, um, who are not necessarily still in that mindset to assume, Oh, well, you're just
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:28.260]   making a mess or you're just, you know, being foolish or, but maybe they're being curious. And if you can get
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:33.700]   down on their level and slow down and figure out why, well, why your, your turn to ask why, you know,
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.940]   why did you do that thing? What were you trying to figure out? The kid who's throwing things in the
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:42.820]   toilet isn't just throwing stuff in the toilet. They're trying to figure out what's down there
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.700]   and how does it work? And what's it connected to? And does it ever stop? And why does the water keep
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:54.580]   coming? And, you know, they've got questions. Exactly. So, I mean, obviously you want to help
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:01.220]   direct it to a productive place, but, but I love that you're saying it's really just as simple as
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:09.940]   slowing down and, and being curious. Um, and you can do that anywhere at any time and, and you never know
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:15.780]   where it's going to take you because the answers are complex. Yes. So, and it's not stagnant. You're not
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.940]   going to say, okay, today we're going to learn about the properties of water. Right. Um, your child
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.740]   has already been learning about the properties of water when they have spilled something, when they
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:33.300]   drink something, when they watch it come from the faucet, when they see you cooking with the stove,
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:41.060]   when you water your plants, when you, so they, they are assimilating. And if, if it makes you feel any
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:49.860]   better, um, they are assimilating in their mind, a library of this is what the world is about.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:58.740]   And so they're categorized. They're constantly, uh, if you watch a child, a toddler, um, sometimes we
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:05.060]   think it's kind of cute and silly, but they'll do the same thing over and over again. And that's,
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:12.020]   but that's what, you know, scientists and Johns Hopkins are doing. They do this same experiment
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:17.460]   over and over because they're looking for, um, they're looking for that cause and effect.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:24.020]   Does it always happen this way? Does the cheerio always drop on the floor? Just, uh, our, our,
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:29.540]   one of our children in a high chair would drop a cheerio and our dog would just learn to sleep
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.620]   under his high chair because he loved that, but there was this nice little cause and effect that he was
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:43.220]   figuring out or even watching you. Like when mommy opens the refrigerator, I get something good to drink
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:50.580]   or the ice maker. You know, like I have one of my grandchildren is fascinated right now by our ice maker.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:58.820]   So when he comes, we have lots of ice all over the place because he loves watching the ice come out of
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:06.260]   the ice maker. Now it's, it's because he's curious and he wants to learn something about that. Now, when you're 12,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:11.940]   you don't do that anymore, but when you're little, you do. And I think we do need to take some of our cues
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:18.900]   from our youngest because I think they're, they haven't learned what is right and what is the
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.940]   right way to explore and the wrong way to explore. They just, they're just, they're just driven by
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:30.660]   their appetite. And I would even flip it too and say, you're, you're right that a toddler does it that
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.780]   way. And a 12 year old does it differently. But something that a 12 year old boy often does is bug
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:42.260]   his sister. He's doing social science, you know, like he's still doing science. He's still
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:48.340]   leaving things. He's testing you, you know, he's still getting up and not making his bed every day
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:54.820]   because he wants to know where is the limit? What do you mean? You know, when you say a consequence,
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:01.940]   you know, that's just a different type of science, but they're still trying to figure out how does the
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.980]   world work when your parents say, you know, bad company corrupts good character? Well, what does
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:14.820]   that mean? You know, like what kind and how much time with that bad company? It's science. Everyone's
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:21.220]   trying to figure it out. And, and that, yeah, that's a good point. They, they shift because then they learn
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:27.380]   the science of soccer or they learn the science of ballet and, um, you don't see it, but they're
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:36.500]   constantly, um, engaging with your, that passion and interest draws them along. So they're constantly
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:42.100]   trying it out. And that's where I think as a parent to be a good observer of your children,
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.940]   um, you can be that, that student. So it's nice.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.100]   Yes. That's great. So I bet you, there are lots of people listening who are like, okay,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.020]   I love that. You guys are curious. Um, did you have a list of ideas for me?
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:03.460]   So maybe we can give them some really good places to start before we close this conversation. What
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:10.820]   are maybe your top five science exploration activity ideas? Yeah, this is, uh, for the outside,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:18.020]   uh, first of all, I like a structure. It really helps me. So I would say that one of the things
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.060]   that we did is that we just followed the days of creation. So one day we looked at, we experimented
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:28.580]   with light. We found, we did a light inventory, like, look, and this is for little guys. They love this.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:35.540]   Look at all, uh, find all the ways that light happens in your house, uh, live an evening without light.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:41.300]   Now it's a little trickier in the summer because it goes late, but see if you can go without light,
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:48.900]   uh, use candles, um, look at, compare, um, how, um, the light of a candle is different from the light
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.780]   of a flashlight. Look at different kinds of light, like ultraviolet light and infrared light, you know,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:59.780]   So each day you could pick or each week, you could pick something that you can like,
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:06.020]   we're going to focus our attention on this. I think sometimes what we can get overwhelmed with is,
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:11.220]   you know, we go on the internet, we go to science activities for kids, and there's, uh, probably there
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:17.620]   are hundreds of thousands. Now they're like videos and this and this, and I think it helps me to narrow.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:24.260]   So I would say either pick, um, like you could go through the days of creation or pick one thing
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   that's really accessible to you, like water. You can do a thousand things with water. It's cheap.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:39.060]   It's right there in your home. And you probably have about a hundred experiments without even leaving
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:47.940]   the house. So I would just say that like a theme or a topic, and then this is where you're, um,
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:54.740]   get your catalog. If you have a CC catalog and look at those, um, core habits and look at those common
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:00.420]   topics, especially comparison and definition and go, okay, put them up somewhere where you can see
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:06.580]   and go, we're going to just attend. Like one of my favorite things to do outside is,
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:13.700]   and that's might be okay with this. So, so just, just put a little square, choose a square
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:20.340]   place outside and just put some little, you know, like string up around it and don't do anything to it.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:28.660]   Just observe it and don't cut the grass, don't do it. And just, okay, count how many different kinds of
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:36.500]   grasses collect, like the little tiny flowers, look for, have them go, okay, try to discover it.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:42.100]   Are there any critters in here? There's usually some kind of beetle, some kind of bug, some kind of fly,
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:49.220]   really help them attend to certain area, like help them close that off, uh, cover half of it with a
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:55.780]   cardboard and not to let the sun go and then compare it two weeks later, see what happens.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:03.540]   So, um, or, or go and look at like, we're going to study this tree this summer, or we're going to plant
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:11.060]   these plants. It is so easy to do. I was thinking, okay, you can get a sponge, like a sponge and you can
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:18.100]   put like, um, I, these are broccoli seeds or alfalfa seeds or radish seeds on them. And you can just watch
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.820]   them grow in your house. So you don't have to be outside. If you don't want to be outside, you can be,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:29.780]   you can grow things inside, you can do with seeds. And I would, so let's see. So I would say, first of all,
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:37.540]   pick some kind of theme or some kind of focus and go, okay. And then come up in your mind, gather some supplies
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:44.180]   that you can have either something you can lead through like an experiment, like, okay,
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:50.660]   I'm going to show you how to do this, make a bubble mixture and then have another thing that they can do.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:58.740]   For example, kids love to pour water. So just buy some, uh, don't do anything really deep because
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:05.980]   that's not safe, but like a shallow pool, or if you have a dishpan and stick it in the floor of the
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:12.080]   kitchen with a towel and just say, okay, I'm one of the, one of the things that I do with my grandchildren,
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:20.160]   my kids had braces. I had a ton of that, like, um, you know, those denture cleansers that you would, you know,
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.940]   use yourself. I just got a big box of that and gave it to them. And they were there for like an hour and a half,
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:33.060]   like, Oh, let's put this in. Let's try this. Let's do this. And so giving them things they can do and explore on
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:39.920]   their own and making that available and then choosing a one or two things that you want to say,
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:47.820]   Hey, let's, let's look at, like, I want to look at how water is, um, is a solvent. What dissolves in
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.060]   water? What doesn't dissolve in water? What floats? What doesn't float? Just the, just those basic questions
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:59.060]   and then give it to them and let them, uh, experiment experiment. And then what I would do
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:07.060]   is make some kind of list, like stick a thing up on the wall. Like if you're doing water, but water,
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:14.020]   word water, what do we, what do we know? And what did we find out? And just like, I'm not saying anything
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:20.640]   fancy, don't buy any pens, just write it down, you know, just jot it down. And then at the end of the
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:26.600]   week, if you did it for a week, go back and look and ask, what was your favorite thing? And, or what did
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:34.300]   you recognize? Make like, even making my grandchildren had never eaten Jell-O. Um, so we made Jell-O,
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:40.960]   but then we, it's a science because you have hot water to activate the gelatin and, and then it,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.240]   and then it kind of, you know, becomes more solid and like, yeah, for them that was magic. So,
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:55.620]   so think of some things like, um, a theme like water and then choose things that they can do set aside.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:01.120]   I want you to hear some stuff, try it, tell me what you think, and then choose one or two activities
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:06.180]   that you think, okay, I'm going to try this. For example, if you had two straws and you put,
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:12.840]   have them sip water with using one straw and then have them sip water, put a straw on the outside of
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.820]   the cup and a straw on the inside of the cup and then drink water. Well, they can't because water it.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:24.000]   So those little things are really super easy to do along with like making Play-Doh and go,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.100]   how did that work? Or use like cornstarch and water. It makes this new, it's so fascinating.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:36.500]   Yeah. And be prepared because they'll want to do it more than one time.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.780]   Uh-huh. And it's okay. Let them do a thousand times. It's fine. Just buy more cornstarch. It's
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:48.420]   really not that bad. So I would just say, uh, pick either a topic like that, like go outside and
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:55.340]   choose an area that you're going to investigate fully. And then you can keep track of it, or you
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.000]   can do something inside, like choose a topic, like we're going to explore water and here's
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.320]   some ideas that we're going to do, or we're going to explore light, or we're going to look
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:12.660]   at critters. You know, um, I, we did, I, oh goodness, we had so many critters, but you don't
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:19.700]   have to do that, but you can have, um, if you just go and get some crickets from, you can
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.340]   have a little cricket container and, and watch them not forever. Um, because sometimes they
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:31.820]   get like, well, um, but it's fun to see. And I think that that's the thing. Uh, another thing
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:40.900]   that you can do is take just some clear contact paper and go and get harvest, um, samples of just
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:47.980]   weeds, different weeds and make us, it's like a giant slide basically. So put them on, cover
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:53.100]   it with clear contact paper, and then use your magnifying glass to like, look at the different
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:00.580]   ways and cut out each one, uh, and have them categorize it. Is this green? Another thing that
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:06.420]   I do, and okay, I'm giving you too many things, but you go to, uh, Lowe's or someplace, you know
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:13.020]   how they have these free samples? Uh-huh. Yeah. So what you do is go get a bunch of green
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:17.060]   samples, just have your kids just, you know, and they're okay if you don't get hundreds
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:24.420]   of them. And then go out and cut them in little strips and go out and see if you can match the
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:31.000]   greens outside. And then bring it inside and do some painting or coloring. If you have an art
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.080]   person, you bring in some samples and go, okay, I want you to try to match the green of this dandelion
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:47.220]   leaf with a green and then try to match them. And what that helps kids see is that, wow, what it helps
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:56.840]   me see is like, wow, God is so in what an artist. Yeah. What an artist. He has just in this little
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.140]   square, he has put this color green, this color green, this color green, this color green. And,
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:09.240]   and I can't match it. I can't do that. Only God can do that. And so that's where it brings you
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:16.340]   naturally to wonder. And that brings you to real thankfulness and worship because that God is going
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:23.320]   to take a, this is what impresses me is that that's the same God that says, you know, are you worried?
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:30.340]   What does he tell you to do? He says, go look at the flowers and go look at the birds. That's a very
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:37.820]   unusual answer, right? But the reason is, is he knows that once we do that, once we see his world,
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.940]   we are so reassured, like, well, if God can make 50 kinds of green,
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:52.160]   then he can take care of me. And I, and I think ultimately that does lead me, it always reassures
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:58.320]   me like, okay, I can relax. If he can do that, I think he can handle what I'm worried about today.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:07.120]   So I think it just helps you. And so those are just some ideas. There are tons of things. And I would
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:13.160]   also, one of the things I would try, I tried to do at the beginning of summer is just put in some kind
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:21.360]   of box, like science-y stuff. And that way it's in one place. I'm not going, you know, hither and
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.280]   yon to do that. So anyway, that would be, and there's, there's just, I mean, I've got a table full
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:35.980]   jello and orange arch and baking soda and, and sponges and yeah, containers, freeze a bunch of
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:46.360]   water and let them, let them melt. Like, yeah, I would love that. Just get containers and try to melt
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:53.000]   get his little, put little things in it, little Legos or something in there and try to race with
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.520]   dad. It's out fastest. Yep. It's just so fun. So fun.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:07.300]   You are really, you're really making me want to, to be a scientist. Not that I'm not a scientist in
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:13.180]   self-regard. We all are, but to lean into it more and you're just such a wealth of information. And
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:20.120]   you're reminding me actually that I, it's the label that has thrown me off over the years
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.920]   because I loved this. So many of the things that you mentioned, I'm like, I have a,
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.760]   cause you all know listening that I was homeschooled through high school. So I have a memory attached to
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:35.740]   a lot of the different experiences that you just described. When you use the corn, starch and water,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:41.440]   I'm like, that's the best. And it's true that I think it's the best because we called it OOBLEC.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.480]   We did it with the book, um, that Dr. Seuss book. And I remember that was actually the experiment
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:53.020]   that my aunt did with us. She was a teacher when my brother was born at the hospital. That's when it
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:57.640]   was introduced to us, but we did it from that point forward and we put some green dye in it to make it
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:05.040]   look like a book. But, but you're so correct that there are so many accessible ways for us to just go
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:12.080]   deep on one topic. You don't have to feel that you need to explore everything. Um, I'm going to try to
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:18.380]   package some of that list so that people can refer to it, um, over on our social media channels,
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:23.020]   just so that, so that people can go back to it because you, you really did give us so many great
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.800]   ideas and I know you have a million more. So we'll have to talk about this again.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.920]   There are tons, uh, and, and they're just repeats of all the things that, like you said,
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.320]   that have hold good memories, but yeah, it was that it was just fun to,
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:42.580]   to resurrect some of those ideas. It's great. It's so great. Well, thank you for talking with
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:50.200]   us today and listeners. Thank you for, for coming along on this ride with us. I hope that you enjoyed
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:58.800]   it. I know that you enjoyed Amy. Um, she's such a blessing and your, your, your appreciation for life
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.940]   and those details. Um, those things are, are contagious about you. And I, it's just such a gift
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.220]   that the Lord has given us in the body of Christ. And so I'm really encouraged by this conversation
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:15.860]   and I pray that it encourages you to, if you know a mom who maybe thinks, oh my goodness, everything's
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:22.180]   such a mess to be inspired. She loves science, but she needs more ideas. Would you send this episode to
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:29.940]   them, um, and go let us know what you thought in a comment on social media or in a review? Um, because
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.940]   your feedback really is valuable to us and we want to make sure that we're making content that encourages
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:39.260]   you. So thanks again for listening and we will see you again next week.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:45.020]   you. So thanks again for listening.
