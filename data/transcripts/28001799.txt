[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.060]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.580]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.280]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.720]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.980]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.780]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.860]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.940]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.140]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.300]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.100]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.100]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.360]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.120]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.420]   Well, listeners, I suspect that all of you are now
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.140]   deep into that daily delight of family learning
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.700]   that we were just talking about
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.540]   and that you are back at it.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.500]   Foundations, essentials, challenge students and families,
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.640]   working and learning together.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.140]   And I wanted us to think a little bit
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.100]   as we begin this new year,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.100]   what is it exactly that we're doing
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.060]   in this homeschooling endeavor?
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540]   I know we're trying to teach our children
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260]   to read and to write,
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.080]   to understand what they read,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.860]   to grasp the facts of history
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.260]   and understand how to live
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.700]   as godly men and women in the world.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.260]   There are academic things that we are practicing
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.700]   and trying to do with our children at home.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.340]   And then there are character building things
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.220]   that we are trying to do with our families at home.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.860]   Today, I really want us to think about
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.260]   the foundations that we're laying with our children,
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.260]   not just foundations as in the foundations curriculum.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.460]   So what we're doing with our little children,
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.260]   giving them lots of good memory work,
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.260]   things to start building a memory palace
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.740]   of facts and information, not just that foundation,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.860]   but the foundation of learning how to think,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.660]   learning how to put ourselves in somebody else's place,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.660]   the foundation of learning all that God has for us
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.900]   as He equips us to be His ambassadors in this world
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.100]   that's not our final home,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.260]   but it is where God's planted us for now.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   And so we want to look at one of classical conversations,
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.060]   we believe statements,
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.000]   and think about what does it mean for our families,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.980]   not just in a real philosophical way,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.740]   which a lot of times is fun to think about,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.740]   but in very practical ways.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.480]   Like what does it mean for me as a mom or a dad at home
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980]   with my child, whether they're five or 10 or 15?
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.580]   And the we believe statement
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.620]   I want us to dive into today is this.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.420]   We believe that classical education
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.860]   prepares us to accept the responsibilities
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.080]   of Christian freedom.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.460]   Now, that does sound like a big philosophical topic.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.620]   And I have got a dear friend with me today
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.580]   hoping that we can dive into this discussion together
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.720]   and that you will enjoy listening along.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.860]   Charity Brown, thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.880]   - Thank you, Lisa.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.720]   It's a privilege to be with you again.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.960]   - Charity works for classical conversation.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.680]   Charity, tell them what you do for classical conversations.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.720]   - Well, I work with classical conversations multimedia
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   and I am the production editor for the Spanish product line
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.700]   that we use internationally.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.140]   - And she does such an amazing job.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.900]   I'm in awe of somebody who can think and write
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.420]   and speak a different language and make it so beautiful.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.740]   And so I appreciate Charity's work
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.180]   as she is very instrumental
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.640]   in helping the curriculum development team
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.560]   pass on the good work that we're doing
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.440]   to other nations.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.340]   But Charity is also a homeschooling mom
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   who has graduated one of her children.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.960]   And so she knows what it is to build
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.180]   not just academic adequacy into her children,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:10.620]   but spiritual sensitivity also,
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.180]   equipping them to be God's emissary to a world.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.620]   So I wanna say, Charity, one of the things I wanna ask you,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.900]   and this is, I want your honest thoughts about this.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.900]   What are the responsibilities of Christian freedom?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.340]   Like we just talked, I just read you that statement.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.580]   Classical education prepares us to accept
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.200]   the responsibilities of Christian freedom.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.120]   So what are those responsibilities?
