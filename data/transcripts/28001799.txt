[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.240]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.680]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.940]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.740]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.840]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.920]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.120]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.040]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.320]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.120]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.360]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.140]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.640]   Well, listeners, I suspect that all of you
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.640]   are now deep into that daily delight of family learning
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.680]   that we were just talking about,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520]   and that you are back at it.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   Foundations, essentials, challenge students and families
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640]   working and learning together.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.120]   And I wanted us to think a little bit
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.100]   as we begin this new year,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.120]   what is it exactly that we're doing
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040]   in this homeschooling endeavor?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.700]   I know we're trying to teach our children to read
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.080]   and to write, to understand what they read,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.160]   to grasp the facts of history,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   and understand how to live as godly men and women
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.720]   in the world.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.260]   There are academic things that we are practicing
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.680]   and trying to do with their children at home.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   And then there are character-building things
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.200]   that we are trying to do with our families at home.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.160]   Today, I really want us to think about the foundations
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.240]   that we're laying with our children,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.240]   not just foundations as in the foundations curriculum,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.440]   so what we're doing with our little children,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.240]   giving them lots of good memory work,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   things to start building a memory palace,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.760]   of facts and information, not just that foundation,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   but the foundation of learning how to think,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680]   learning how to put ourselves in somebody else's place,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   the foundation of learning all that God has for us
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.920]   as he equips us to be his ambassadors in this world
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   that's not our final home,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.280]   but is where God's planted us for now.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   And so we want to look at one of classical conversations,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.680]   we believe statements, and think about what does it mean
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   for our families, not just in a real philosophical way,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.740]   which a lot of times is fun to think about,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.760]   but in very practical ways.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.480]   Like what does it mean for me as a mom or a dad at home
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.320]   with my child, whether they're five or 10 or 15?
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.480]   The we believe statement I want us to dive into today
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   is this, we believe that classical education prepares us
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   to accept the responsibilities of Christian freedom.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   Now, that does sound like a big philosophical topic,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.640]   and I have got a dear friend with me today
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.560]   hoping that we can dive into this discussion together
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.720]   and that you will enjoy listening along.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.860]   Charity Brown, thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.640]   - Thank you, Lisa, it's a privilege to be with you again.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.960]   - Charity works for classical conversation.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.680]   Charity, tell them what you do for classical conversations.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.720]   - Well, I work with classical conversations multimedia,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   and I am the production editor for the Spanish product line
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   that we use internationally.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.120]   And she does such an amazing job.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   I'm in awe of somebody who can think and write and speak
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.420]   a different language and make it so beautiful.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.760]   And so I appreciate Charity's work
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.880]   as she's very instrumental in helping
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.640]   the curriculum development team
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.720]   pass on the good work that we're doing to other nations.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   But Charity is also a homeschooling mom
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.320]   who has graduated one of her children.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.920]   And so she knows what it is to build
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.160]   not just academic adequacy into her children,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:10.600]   but spiritual sensitivity also,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.140]   equipping them to be God's emissary to a world.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.580]   So, Charity, one of the things I want to ask you,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.860]   and this is, I want your honest thoughts about this,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.860]   what are the responsibilities of Christian freedom?
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.300]   Like we just talked, I just read you that statement,
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.560]   classical education prepares us to accept
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.180]   the responsibilities of Christian freedom.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.080]   So what are those responsibilities?
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.180]   - Well, the phrase itself I think is very counter-cultural.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.020]   - Yeah.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.900]   - The idea that freedom has responsibilities.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.500]   When I was in public high school, ninth grade,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.440]   I believe it was on the back of my English teacher's door,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.540]   there was a poster and it said,
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.060]   freedom is not doing what you want,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.740]   it's doing what you ought.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.280]   And that just stuck with me over the years.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680]   And as I've gotten older,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.780]   the idea of being able to discern
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.700]   what we ought to be doing,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.140]   which as Christians, we have two goals,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.360]   and that is to love God and love others,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.020]   being able to hone in on that
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.380]   and focus in on how does that look in our daily lives,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.460]   loving God and loving others,
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.140]   and in obedience to Him, we find freedom.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.960]   We find the freedom to please the Lord.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.100]   And that is such an exciting adventure for all of us.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.300]   - I really love that.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.800]   The whole idea of what we ought to do,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.260]   and that as Christians, what we are called to do
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.900]   is to love God and to love others,
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.900]   and that freedom actually gives us permission
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.940]   to do what we ought to do,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.700]   but it also calls us to do what we ought to do.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.260]   That's really beautifully put, Charity.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.280]   What kind of responsibilities do you think
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.940]   the Lord puts on us when we come to know Him
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.100]   and we give ourselves to Him as servants,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.280]   acknowledging Him as our Master,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.300]   not just as a great God who loves us?
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.460]   - Right, well, the first thing that comes to mind
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.820]   is Ephesians, the very famous passage
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   on Ephesians 2, verses eight through 10.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.500]   It says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.180]   "and this is not of your own doing, it is the gift of God."
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.180]   And so we always start there that our position in Christ,
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.420]   our freedom in Christ is a gift of grace,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.020]   not a result of works that no one may boast.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.780]   We absolutely can do nothing to save ourselves.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.900]   It is all Him, but I love this next verse
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.300]   because it's often not linked onto the first two.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.140]   "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus,"
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.420]   He did this thing in us, "for good works,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.380]   "which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.660]   And so our response to the grace of God that sets us free
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.200]   is to walk in the good works He has prepared for us,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.900]   not as a means of salvation in any sense,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.900]   but as an expression of love to Him.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.340]   We often tell our children God's love language is obedience.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.340]   And that is found, of course, in the passages
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.000]   in John 14 and 15, where Jesus says,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.700]   "I am doing this thing, I am obeying the fathers,
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.460]   "that the world may see that I love the Father."
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.460]   And so that to me is how Christian freedom is expressed
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   theologically, and our starting point for practical life.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.400]   - I love that, obedience, yes, yes.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.840]   So that's beautiful, and I suspect something
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.640]   that all of us, as we listen to this,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   all of our listeners are thinking,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   "Yes, that is what I want to pass on to my children."
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.520]   The grace that God has given us
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.920]   is what we've built our family on,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.000]   and we want our children to learn
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   that the proper response to grace in love is obedience,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.580]   and is doing what He calls us to do in the world.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.580]   So let me ask you this, how does classical education
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.240]   prepare us to do this thing?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.400]   - I feel like classical education prepares us
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.180]   to walk in love of God and love of others really well.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:06.360]   In a practical sense, loving someone means caring
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.560]   about what they care about.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.320]   That's at least a part of what love is,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   and what God cares about more than anything
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.760]   is saving the world and making Himself known.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.080]   I've just been recently reading through the Old Testament
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.660]   again with my family, and even in the times
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.720]   when he's pouring out his just wrath on the wicked,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.300]   he keeps saying, "So the nations will know
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.480]   "that I am the Lord.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.280]   "So the nations will know that I am the Lord."
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   And his obsession from Genesis to Revelation
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.100]   is to reveal himself, to make himself known to the world,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.200]   to rescue the lost.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.520]   And a classical Christian education allows us
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.120]   to show our children, through great conversations
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.040]   and great books and through the study of Scripture,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.580]   to show our children the truth.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.820]   And the truth is, we start out lost.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.200]   The world is lost, that there is a rescue plan,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.740]   and the only reason a rescue plan is needed
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.300]   is if someone's in trouble.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.580]   And so for me, to be able to classically educate
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.300]   my children at home means inculcating,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.740]   putting into them the truth, the truth of lostness,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.840]   the truth of God's great obsession with loving the lost
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.180]   and saving the lost, and how we can join in
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.420]   as we experience, even in education,
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.820]   as we experience these ideas and consider the decisions
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.820]   of others, we too can join in his great mission.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.480]   And by doing so, express our love to him.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.120]   And that is a great, great privilege.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.080]   - And that is the great commission to go
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.280]   and to make disciples.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   I love the way you said that it's God's obsession
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.600]   that people come to him.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   He is obsessed with the idea of giving people the chance
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   to know him and to turn from their own selfish desires
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.020]   to him.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.300]   So it's God's obsession.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.700]   And if we love him, and as we love him,
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.520]   his mission becomes our mission.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.440]   We become his hands and feet.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.640]   I really like that.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.300]   And I think you're right, classical education prepares us
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.020]   to put ourselves in other's shoes,
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.040]   to think other people's thoughts.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   I'm not saying it opens us up to take on
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.760]   their thought patterns.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.240]   We certainly don't want our children to join the thoughts
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.780]   of ungodly people or to follow bad leadership.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.780]   But I think a classical education that shows you the past
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:53.420]   and the present and what peoples all over the world
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.120]   and cultures all over the world have struggled with
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.080]   and think about and how they express things,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   I think it does allow us and our children to understand
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.720]   quote unquote, where people are coming from,
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.860]   or to give us an intersection point.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.700]   It's really hard to begin a conversation with somebody
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.240]   that you have nothing in common with.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.180]   Or if you don't know how to ask good questions,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.000]   to find your commonality.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.840]   You don't know how to approach people
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.700]   and you don't know how to be approachable.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.000]   And that makes it hard.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.840]   I love it.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.840]   In the catalog, this we believe statement
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.320]   is listed in the catalog and I absolutely love
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   this paragraph because it sort of tells what the classical
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.920]   educator's mission is with regards to the responsibilities
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.320]   of Christian freedom.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   It says, we examine the words, thoughts, and actions
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.880]   of the past and present, of Christians and non-Christians,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.460]   of neighboring and distant cultures,
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.180]   all in order to stand like Paul and be all things
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.180]   to all people with a ready answer for the hope within us.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:28.780]   And so I think it is very, it's far seeing
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.420]   that the classical education is far seeing
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.420]   in that it knows we need a way to connect
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.340]   with people we want to influence.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.200]   And so that's really cool.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   I know that for my girls, I loved the classical education
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:57.560]   we offered them, taught them how to speak well.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.140]   And I was glad about that.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.660]   It taught them how to make their points clearly
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.800]   and succinctly enough that people didn't lose interest
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.700]   before they got to the end.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.560]   And it taught them how to shore up all of their arguments
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.600]   with good evidence and moving stories.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   And that was awesome.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.720]   But the other thing it taught them was how to listen,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   how to truly listen to another's point
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.640]   instead of merely using your time
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.820]   to marshal your next answer.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.680]   It taught them to listen carefully to somebody else,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   especially an idea that seemed opposing
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.920]   to their current belief.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.120]   It taught them to listen and sift through the nuances
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   and the fact and to examine it from all areas.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.520]   And that to me is a priceless reason
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.500]   to pursue a classical education.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.080]   - Right, I agree.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.760]   I think a couple of things come to mind when you say that
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   we don't expose them to these things
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.340]   so that our children are sponges
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.440]   and they soak up all the pagan ideas of the world.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.660]   You know, G.K. Chesterton has a quote that I love
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.760]   and he says, "Don't be so open-minded.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.920]   "Your brains fall out."
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.640]   I would use that on my children occasionally.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.840]   But the idea of being able to approach people,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.440]   cultures, ideas, past and present,
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.080]   and you can even predict, you know,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.520]   our children love to write fantasy or sci-fi,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.360]   predict the choices of the future.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.440]   All of these things, you know,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.000]   I think sometimes Christians have been afraid
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.280]   to filter other cultures
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.920]   because they're like, oh no, is that judging?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.080]   Is that what judging means?
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.600]   Not, you know, don't judge.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.800]   But the biblical, there is a biblical form of judging
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.840]   where we hold ideas up to the standard of scripture.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.400]   And I know when the children and I,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.440]   when they were very little,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.600]   I would take them to various cultural events.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   We went to the Japanese Cherry Blossom Festival
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   thingy in town.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.440]   We went to the Indian Food Festival and Dance.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.800]   We went to the,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   and we would have these really fascinating conversations
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.480]   where we would, on the way home, we would say,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   what did you see in this place?
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   What did you hear that lines up with the values of scripture?
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.640]   And they would say things like, wow, you know,
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.160]   the Asian cultures, they really put an emphasis
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.960]   on honoring the older people and their families.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.240]   And we would talk about how that was a reflection
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.040]   of the beauty that God had put in their culture.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.080]   And then we would say,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.960]   and what did you see that didn't line up
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   with the truth of scripture?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.840]   Well, these people maybe worshiped idols.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.720]   Is that a search for God?
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.400]   Well, no, Romans tells us that is not a search for God.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.320]   That is the light has been shown in Romans one,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.480]   general revelation, and mankind has turned
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.040]   and made a substitute and we are wandering in the dark.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.200]   And so to be able to put those things up and say,
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.840]   we have a standard against which we can view culture.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.320]   And we have a standard against which we can view
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   the decisions of people which all in mass make up a culture
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.920]   and hold them up to scripture and say,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.200]   and how does this inform how we should live?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.960]   I really feel like the exposure to different cultures
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   and different ideas, if a parent can go at it
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.400]   with scripture under their arm
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.520]   and not with a sense of fear that if my child sees this,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.600]   they may be drawn to this in careful discernment,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.360]   it can be greatly used to bring your child closer to Christ.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.320]   And we found that to be an invaluable exercise as a family.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.320]   That is such a super practical way to begin
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.400]   these kinds of discussions, even with your,
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.320]   like you said, when your kids are little,
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.640]   we did things like the Greek festival
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.800]   with the food and the dancing.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   - All the great food.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.160]   - Yes, all the great food.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.280]   And we took them to other types of worship surfaces
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.680]   so that they could see how other cultures and other peoples,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.760]   I love that, it's very practical.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.920]   And I love your injunction that afterwards you ask,
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.320]   so you're asking really them to compare,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.480]   how is this like what the Lord calls us to do?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.880]   What was missing from this experience?
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.040]   But that allows them to both develop their own identity
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   as God's own and see how other cultures are worshiping
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.880]   or are thinking or are forming their thoughts.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.240]   And that's really important.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.080]   And here's the thing, our children,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.960]   God willing in the natural order, in his natural order,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.160]   our children will leave our home and they will go,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.280]   and they'll still be in our spheres,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.880]   but not in our immediate orbits.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.280]   And we need to prepare them for the world
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.840]   that is outside our home.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.520]   I don't want it to be a rude awakening for my children.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.560]   I don't want it to be the shock of a cold shower
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.800]   when they get out there.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.440]   I want them to have experience and thought about
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.960]   and talked about some of these big differences
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.760]   between the world that God is calling us to
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.480]   and the world that they are surrounded by on a daily basis.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   I can remember when my oldest was in high school,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.800]   I went to talk to a brand new
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.640]   or fairly new classical conversations community
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.800]   whose parents were up in arms
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.160]   that our young high school students, ninth graders,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   were being exposed to philosophy for the first time
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.560]   and some philosophies of godless,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.880]   especially in some minds, godless thinkers of past ages.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.400]   And so they were really worried about this
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   and had a lot of pushback.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   And I had taken my daughter with me
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.840]   because I knew these were issues that were gonna come up.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.780]   And I asked her to come up and she said,
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.680]   "I had a time, what do you want me to say?"
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.560]   And I said, "I'm not telling you what to say.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.400]   "I want you to answer the questions that they give you
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.320]   "from your own experience.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.660]   "And that's what I want you to say."
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.360]   And so when somebody said,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.320]   "Didn't it make you worry about your faith?
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.680]   "And didn't it make you question
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.520]   "what you had always known about God and about God's plan
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.020]   "for man and about how things came to be
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.360]   "when you were faced with these other thoughts?"
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.760]   And she said, "No, not really."
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.640]   She was really thoughtful.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.360]   I didn't tell her the questions ahead of time
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.440]   that I had been given.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:22.420]   She said, "No, it made me realize that God wants me
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:29.040]   "to think big thoughts and that he is strong enough
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.280]   "to stand up under close scrutiny
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.360]   "and that everything I knew about God
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.720]   "and everything I saw of him in the scripture
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.840]   "is an answer for these other philosophies
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.120]   "and these other ways of thinking."
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.660]   And she said, "Those are dead men thinking
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.760]   "and I have a God who's alive who leads me."
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.120]   And at that point I thought, okay, that's the answer.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.520]   That's the answer to why we talk about these things
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   with our children while they're still at home with us.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   So if it is the ideal for us to raise our children
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.380]   to accept the responsibilities of Christian freedom,
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.360]   what should students be doing?
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.240]   What kinds of things are they supposed to ponder
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.000]   or practice, what would you say to that, Charity?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.520]   - Well, I think what you just said actually leads me
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.880]   to my answer for that and that would be,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.840]   I think that students benefit hugely
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   from the introduction to logic that CC gives them
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.140]   prior to their introduction to a lot
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.380]   of the great philosophers.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.480]   And the reason I say that is because the logic
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.140]   is presented in a Christian way.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.680]   And I remember my son, when he had just finished
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.420]   challenge B, I believe it was,
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.900]   and we had gone through formal logic
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.840]   and we were having a family discussion.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.120]   I said, "So Alex, what do you wanna do when you grow up?"
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.900]   We were having that classic conversation, right?
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.040]   And he said, "Oh, I wanna be a Christian."
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.100]   And I was a little taken aback.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.020]   I was like, "That's awesome, why would you say that?"
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.840]   And he said, "Mom, it's the only thing that makes sense."
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   And he had seen logic, that the logic,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.200]   the study of logic as applied to scripture
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.180]   just proved again, the orderly, beautiful mind of God.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.560]   And he had that love in his heart
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.980]   before he hit philosophy, right?
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.120]   And so it's, I think that as the students dig into logic,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.260]   and I think as they hold scripture up to logic
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.060]   and they find syllogisms in scripture,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.920]   they see how God's mind is reflected there,
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.720]   it prepares them.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.840]   And then they can begin to explore these other philosophers
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.180]   and say, "Okay, well, how did this person approach
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.060]   or deviate from the standard of scripture?"
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.980]   So I think really digging into the subjects of logic
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.840]   and philosophy are excellent preparation for freedom.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:07.040]   Because free people, truly free Christian people
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.620]   have to analyze and filter through ideas
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.040]   to be able to make good decisions.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.060]   And I think those two particular subjects
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.000]   are ideal for preparation.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   - I love what you said, Charity, about our students
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.360]   being really equipped in the study of logic
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.800]   to then think clearly about philosophy
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.720]   and not be ensnared by that,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.980]   but be able to really clearly think.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.380]   And I love that my older daughter,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.200]   who also loved Challenge B Logic,
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.880]   she put that to the test.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.640]   She actually, I found out later in high school
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.780]   and then in college, she would sit with her Bible
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.800]   doing her daily devotions.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.220]   And especially when she was reading Paul's writings,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.440]   she would turn the scripture verses into syllogisms
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   and prove for herself that these are valid arguments.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.900]   And they are also true arguments.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.380]   And so it shored up her faith, and that was beautiful.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.080]   And she learned to think well and think clearly.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.260]   And that is a great benefit of all of the classical
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.640]   education that our students receive.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.980]   And we've talked a lot about what we give them
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.460]   in the challenge years, but there are great skills
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.260]   of thinking and listening that our younger students get.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.560]   Even in foundations, our little kids learn to listen
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.080]   well when they have to listen to presentations
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   in foundations.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.960]   They are taught to listen intently and to think
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.220]   of good questions to ask about the content.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.880]   So from a four and five year old age,
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.400]   they are being trained to be good listeners
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.600]   and good presenters and good thinkers.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   And so yes, logic skills and clear thinking skills
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.420]   are great, but so are the skills of asking good questions.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.160]   And those actually, those kinds of skills
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.040]   of asking good questions are what we want citizens to have.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   We need our children to grow up and be able to ask
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.300]   good questions of the leaders of our country,
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.020]   of the leaders of their local government.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.240]   All of our children are gonna have two jobs.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.480]   They are gonna be citizens of heaven and citizens
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.840]   of the city and state and country in which they live.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.320]   And so we are equipping them to be good citizens
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.800]   when we equip them to think clearly,
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.980]   to listen well, and to ask good questions.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.240]   That's really important.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.260]   So that's what our students should do.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.440]   You've already told us that as parents,
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.840]   one thing that we can do is study our scriptures
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   and know what we believe and why we believe it
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.520]   and to bring those scriptures to bear
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.440]   as we lead our children to study.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.880]   Are there other things that you think we as parents
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.680]   should do and think about and practice?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.000]   I think the concept of teaching our children
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.520]   to ask good questions is crucial.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.000]   When you ask a good question,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   then the truth is revealed, right?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.960]   If you don't know how to ask good questions
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.600]   and you're just reacting to things,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.480]   then it gets all muddled.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.220]   And so I think teaching our children to ask good questions
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.520]   is really, really important.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.440]   And I think that's best modeled by a parent.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.740]   When the child comes up and says,
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.160]   "Well, I think blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.200]   which can be full of foolishness as we know,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.800]   the first question of saying, "Why do you think that?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.960]   What support do you have for that?"
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   And just allowing them to hear good questions being modeled.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.720]   My husband is an expert in question asking.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.200]   I would say I'm a novice, but he's done a lot of that.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   And the other things that come to mind, two things.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.920]   One is that as parents,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.780]   we need to give our children freedom gradually.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.560]   What I mean by that is when they're four and five,
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.680]   they should not be being asked
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.600]   what type of math curriculum they would like to pursue.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.360]   They can barely decide not to eat a crayon.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.160]   So I feel like if you give your children gradual freedom,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   gradual independence, gradual decisions,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.640]   instead of giving them too much and having to retract.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.360]   So the way this looks like in our house
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.680]   is that every birthday,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.240]   our children as part of their birthday celebration,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.800]   get one new privilege and one new responsibility.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   And by the time they graduate, they have this freedom.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.600]   I remember when Catherine, a few years ago,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.560]   like around age 16, 17, 16, 15 maybe,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.600]   we had been kind of watching her grow
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.560]   and how she chose food.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.680]   Like what is a healthy, balanced, nutritious diet?
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.720]   And just kind of watching her ability
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.600]   to balance these things.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.260]   And so for her birthday, her new freedom was,
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.780]   we were not going to tell her what she could and couldn't eat
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.460]   that she had that freedom.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.780]   Because the truth is when they leave home,
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.120]   they've got that freedom.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.740]   - Absolutely, and some don't know how to use it.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.940]   - I know, so that was her new freedom
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.140]   because we had watched her and said,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.220]   "She is ready for this new freedom."
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.180]   And so we didn't police her at the table, right?
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.500]   And so our son came to us and he was two years younger
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.300]   and he said to me,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.340]   "Mommy, please don't ever give me that freedom.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.140]   "I will be, I will be as big as a barn, please don't ever."
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.100]   He saw that freedom coming and said,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.400]   "I don't have the maturity to handle it."
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.260]   And that has changed as he's gotten older.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.640]   But the truth is we have gradually given them freedom.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.520]   And I think parents who are just like,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.840]   "Well, children need the experience
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.900]   "of making all these decisions for themselves
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.620]   "on whatever level."
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.060]   They often have to retract
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.820]   and we're taking away this device
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.220]   and we're taking away this privilege
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.500]   and the child becomes angry.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.340]   And so it's been much more natural
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.240]   and edifying for us to do a gradual freedom,
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.520]   freedom and responsibility
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.000]   growing gradually in our children.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.500]   And the other thought that comes to mind on little people
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.540]   is that we used captive car seat games all the time
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.620]   when our kids were little in the car.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.700]   And so what we did that pushed them toward,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.660]   thinking about choices, decisions,
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.940]   books and stuff in the future
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.300]   is we would play,
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.380]   and I may have told you this before, I don't know,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.340]   we would play the kind unkind game,
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.960]   the wise unwise game, the truth lie game.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.860]   And so when they were really, really tiny
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.180]   and it was always very silly,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.260]   this is like pre-read, this is pre-reading,
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.740]   this is like four year olds, right?
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.500]   They're in the car and I would say,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.380]   "Sissy is wearing a pink shirt."
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.380]   And they would say, "True, the dog likes to eat flowers."
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.900]   And they'd say, "Lie."
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.260]   And so we would work on truth and lie.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.020]   Then as they got older, we would, a little bit older,
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.220]   this is still very little, we would do kind or unkind.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.060]   Your Grammy bit the preacher's hand
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.260]   when he tried to shake it.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.820]   (laughing)
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.580]   Those kinds of silliness, but it allowed them to say,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.940]   "Oh, that's unkind."
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.940]   Or, "This is respectful or disrespectful."
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.740]   And later on, "This is wise or unwise."
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.860]   And we were training them to look at things
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.260]   and make a judgment call.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.300]   And that did a couple of things.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.860]   One, it prepared them for now when Catherine,
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.740]   gone away from home, looks at an option she has.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.540]   She can say, "Does this fit the repository
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.540]   "of wise things I know?
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.100]   "Or does it fit the repository of unwise things that I know?"
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.020]   But it also, it made parenting easier
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.300]   in the sense that when I would say,
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.660]   "You need to be kind to your sister."
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.660]   There was a whole group of ideas in their minds
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.260]   of what that might look like.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.020]   And it was taken out of the disciplinary,
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.540]   out of the stressful moments, into a game.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.060]   And so, I think for little people,
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   that was our saving grace for learning
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.780]   those first beginning skills of discernment and freedom.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.420]   - And absolutely, it gives the children
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   a huge sense of confidence and non-nervousness.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.180]   They are, I can remember having friends
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.300]   who thought I was absolutely crazy.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   Mike, we would practice responses in advance with our girls.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.400]   So, we are having a birthday party
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.660]   and people are gonna bring you gifts.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.020]   If you get something you already have, what will you say?
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.860]   - Right.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.900]   - If you get a present that you absolutely hate,
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.980]   what will you say?
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.800]   If somebody doesn't bring you a gift, what will you say?
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.220]   If somebody says something unkind
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.580]   about another person's gift.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.180]   And so, we would role play those.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.020]   We would come up with, what could you say
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.100]   that shows you appreciate that person
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.100]   and the thought that they had in bringing you a present
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.140]   to celebrate your birthday,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.420]   even if you either have this already or hate it.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.260]   What will you say?
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.660]   You will clearly not say, "I hate it," or, "I've got one."
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.560]   - Right.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.460]   - Or, "I'm gonna take this back," or, "Do you have a receipt?"
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.140]   But it put them at ease because here's the deal,
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.580]   little people who want to do the right thing
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.740]   in the heat of a moment don't always know what to do.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.020]   And so, sometimes a very, even to them,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.980]   an appropriate thing will come out if you don't practice.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.580]   And so, I love that as a super practical way
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:16.180]   of beginning to grow kind, compassionate,
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.420]   merciful, gracious humans.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.560]   So, let me ask you this.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.260]   You've given us some, what it looks like in the short term,
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.680]   you know, at home, being able to choose your own food.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.420]   We did something very similar to that
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.480]   in being able to choose your own bedtime
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.460]   or to choose your own clothes
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.820]   or to choose what books to choose at the library
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.660]   or books to read.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.860]   As they were growing up, they got different freedoms
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.700]   based on their obvious readiness for said freedom.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.180]   What will be the result, do you suspect,
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.460]   if we do not teach our children
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.340]   about the responsibilities of Christian freedom?
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.880]   What if we don't lead them to accept them
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.640]   and manage them well?
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.400]   What will happen?
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.920]   - Well, I think if we do not teach our children
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.480]   how to manage the responsibilities of Christian freedom,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.780]   they are going to be taught.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.940]   Children don't just stay a blank slate
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.820]   and someone's gonna teach them something.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:26.080]   And I think the world is very, very happy
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.060]   to come along with a counter message.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.120]   And, you know, I was just thinking about this the other day,
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.580]   I heard Alistair Begg preaching
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.160]   and he referenced the Bob Dylan song,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.340]   "Gotta Serve Someone."
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.180]   I think is what it's called.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.540]   - Yes, yes, I think so.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.060]   - And how the story goes that he became a believer
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.480]   and he wrote this song, you know,
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.260]   it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.340]   but you're gonna have to serve someone.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.100]   Well, the story goes, and I don't know how accurate it is,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.480]   but that John Lennon found that very offensive
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.860]   and he wrote a counter song.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.060]   And in his counter song, it was all about,
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.980]   you gotta serve yourself.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.840]   And I think that's a beautiful example of the fact that,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.340]   and a sobering example of the fact
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.580]   that the world has an alternate message.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.580]   It is being pumped continuously out there
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.620]   and our children are going to encounter it.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.060]   And so I think if we do not teach our children
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.900]   how to manage the Christian responsibility,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.180]   the responsibilities of Christian freedom,
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.020]   they will just follow the world.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.660]   They will serve themselves.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.680]   They will make it about themselves.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.820]   And if they're not surrendered to the Lord,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.080]   then they are gonna be surrendered to someone.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.260]   And that's not an option.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.480]   We are gonna serve someone.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.400]   So I think the sobering thing is that they will be taught
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.880]   and they will follow someone.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.380]   And so the intentionality that we have
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.340]   as classical Christian educators
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.420]   is a beautiful and sobering task.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.840]   - That is, that's great.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.420]   That is an awesome, put the period to the discussion.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.260]   I love that.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.400]   Thank you so much, Charity.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.640]   It's so funny, as you were talking about,
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.140]   you're gonna have to, your children will make a decision
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.340]   and they will follow the right values
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.040]   or they will follow the selfish world.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.640]   It reminds me, I was gonna tell people today
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.500]   about a movie that's coming out.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.680]   It's called "Miracle in East Texas."
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.240]   It kinda goes along with, are you gonna serve yourself
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.940]   or are you gonna do the right thing?
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.660]   This movie's coming out in October.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.100]   The end of October.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.660]   And it is about doing what's right.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.800]   And it's a movie that your whole family can enjoy.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.780]   Okay, so you won't be embarrassed
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.240]   to have your little kids watch it.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.440]   It is the true story.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.560]   It's a true story.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.740]   It's about the biggest oil strike
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.000]   in the history of the world.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   It happened right at the dawn of the Great Depression.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   The story, it's kinda fun.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.720]   I mean, I can't, I sorta now can't wait to see it.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.460]   It follows the story of two con men
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.420]   who are gonna convince investors
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.700]   to invest in these worthless oil rigs
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.660]   but then they discover these oil rigs
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.120]   are not so worthless after all.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.660]   Maybe this would be a really good teaching tool.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.580]   It would definitely bring up
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.140]   a lot of good discussions and families.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.940]   It's called "Miracle in East Texas."
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.760]   It is a Kevin Sorbo film.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.380]   It is coming to a theater near you, we hope, October 29th.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.460]   If you wanna get tickets now
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.440]   or find out where it's coming,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   you can visit sorbostudios.com.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   That's Sorbo Studios, S-O-R-B-O, studios.com
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.240]   and find out more information about that.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.100]   Charity, thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.860]   This has been a fun topic to think through with you
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.900]   and I appreciate both your deep insights
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.680]   and your practical tips.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.420]   - Thank you, Lisa.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.060]   It's always fun to hang out with you.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.900]   - I love it.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.580]   Okay, listeners, take the good from this
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.620]   and go be everyday educators in your own home
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.060]   and I'll see you next week.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.900]   Bye.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.480]   (gentle music)
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
