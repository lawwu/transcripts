[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   My guest today on Radical Personal Finance is a dude who did it.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.520]   He charted out a path to financial independence at a young age and worked like a maniac, saved
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.600]   like a crazy guy, and he did it.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.680]   He's now financially independent.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.680]   He's going to share with us a little bit about his story, what worked, what didn't, and was
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.680]   it worth it.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.680]   [Music]
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:40.880]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.920]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480]   Today I bring you an interview with Scott Alan Turner.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920]   Recorded this one at Podcast Movement in Fort Worth, Texas back in August.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.880]   Scott's a really young, really awesome guy.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   I thought he was young, but I don't think he's quite that young.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.080]   But he's a really cool guy and I'm thrilled to make his acquaintance.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.520]   You're basically going to hear me learn about his story, but he's where most of us want
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.080]   to get to.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600]   He's the guy to learn from.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680]   One of the consistent themes on Radical Personal Finance is financial independence.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.880]   I believe that should be a goal for most of us.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.000]   Now what that looks like will vary depending on our background, our circumstances, the
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880]   type of lifestyle that we envision for ourselves.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.360]   The numbers will be very different depending on what aspect.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.660]   Financial independence for some is $3,000 a month and financial independence for others
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.440]   is $30,000 a month.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.360]   I don't think personally, my own opinion, take it as simply an opinion, my own opinion
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.880]   is that financial independence isn't really the ultimate goal.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.580]   It's just a step on the way and it's a worthy goal.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.680]   If you're working, you might as well work towards something and if you're saving, you
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.360]   might as well save towards financial independence.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.480]   It's possible to do it faster than some other people have done and there's many ways to
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   reach financial independence.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   But today, I'm going to bring you this story with Scott Alan Turner and he's going to share
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   with us his experience because the reality is he's a pretty normal dude who did some
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:19.920]   things that most people don't do and achieved a place that very few people will ever achieve.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.760]   That's the kind of guy we should sit back and learn from.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.560]   Scott, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Great to be here.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   This has been fun.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.320]   We're sitting here at Podcast Movement and one of the opportunities of a conference like
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   this is I've been able to talk to a lot of people who are in the financial media space.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.920]   One of the coolest things about financial media is that a lot of people in this space
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.520]   are what I think of as just normal people.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   I love to bring those types of stories and that type of advice to the Radical Personal
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.400]   Finance community because it's often much more accessible.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.640]   Kick us off with, share with us a little bit about your story, especially as it pertains
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   to money.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   Sure.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.520]   My story, as I like to say, I was a money moron coming out of college.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   I was for many, many years until I started learning about personal finance.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   My first exposure to personal finance was a guy on the radio by the name of Clark Howard.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   Nice.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   Love Clark.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.880]   Consumer advocate who's been doing it for a number of years.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.360]   Saw his billboard up on a sign, started listening to his radio show.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.320]   Really it was a pivoting point in my life realizing all the stupid stuff I had done
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   thus far and really got me thinking about, "Oh, here's how you should really handle money."
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.720]   When I was growing up, the only lessons I got from my parents about learning about money
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.920]   was save some of what you earn.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.160]   I mean, that was it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   Hey, at least they taught you that.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.800]   That's not the most normal lesson.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Right.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.000]   I got that bit, but nothing about, "Here's what compound interest is.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.800]   Here's how you go take out a loan."
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.680]   They rented their entire lives, so there was nothing about, "Here's how to buy a house,"
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.040]   or anything along that lines.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.840]   From learning about Clark Howard, listening to him, I started correcting some of my mistakes
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.880]   that I had made coming out of college, having credit card debt, having student loan debt,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   paying way too much money for automobiles, and really getting under my head and taking
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.320]   it from there and turning my life around.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.560]   Isn't it cool how a radio guy like Clark Howard can be just such a constant source of advice
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.040]   and encouragement as you're making changes?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.280]   He's been doing this for a long time, and he has impact.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.080]   I don't know how big his footprint is, but he's impacted so many lives.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.360]   I just love it because with radio, oftentimes people get intrigued.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.480]   They can choose when to tune in, and over time, they're probably at first saying, "What's
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   this guy going on and on about?"
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.520]   As with anything, the average of the five people that you spend the most time with,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.840]   and oftentimes with media, that can turn into a radio person.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.240]   What was it about his message that captured you?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000]   He's really a down-to-earth guy.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.600]   People who listen to him for a period of time, they will always relate that to you.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.840]   You can connect with him.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.740]   He's not influenced by products or services.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.360]   He doesn't take any endorsements.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.060]   He's just telling it like it is from his standpoint.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.060]   He's very frugal.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.560]   He's called America's cheapskate, I believe, is what people refer to him as.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.160]   Really there's just a lot that you can take away from him, how to get the best deals on
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.920]   how to buy stuff, where to go to get your insurance, how to get started investing.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.200]   He's just so knowledgeable and has such a breadth of experience, and he's been doing
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.280]   it for so long.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.320]   He's one of the guys on my list I'd like to get on Radical Personal Finance at some point
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.600]   because from my understanding, he has a pretty cool financial independence story.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.120]   He worked hard, grew a travel agency, sold that and retired, as I understand it.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.760]   Then he went on and built the Clark Howard community, I guess I'll say, the show and
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.360]   all the associated things.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.960]   I heard him mention one time when I was listening to his show that he doesn't spend any of the
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.280]   money that he makes with Clark Howard.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.400]   He basically saves either all of it or 70% of it or just some massive percentage of it.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   He doesn't do it because he has to.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.480]   He does it because he loves it.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   Right.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   It's cool.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   I can't stand how slow he talks.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   I have to listen to him as quick of a speed as possible.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.240]   He knows that.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.360]   He gets that feedback on his show sometimes, but if I listen to him at normal speed, it's
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.880]   like fingernails on a chalkboard for me.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   Sure.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.320]   One of the other complaints about people had, it's not really a complaint, it's more of
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.440]   a funny story that people have about him over the years.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.960]   It's like, "Here's how you can make a living answering the same five questions for three
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.680]   hours a day for decades."
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   Which is not true.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   He goes into a lot more information.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.600]   What I enjoy about his show is it's not just straight up personal finance.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.400]   It's open a retirement account, do that.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   I enjoy his little travel tips.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   He's actually tuned into the cell phone marketplace.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.280]   This consumer scam information is interesting.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   It's an interesting show.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   It's very different than some of the other shows.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.200]   Very different than Edelman, very different than Ramsey.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.280]   It's a unique show and a really cool resource for people.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.320]   What have those changes meant in your life?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.720]   Where have you come, what's the path from college to where you are today?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   Coming out of college, I had a lot of student loans.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.600]   The key of my original change when I came out of college was when I got the first student
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.360]   loan bill started rolling in nine months after I got out of college.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   I got the first bill.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.840]   It's like, "All right, you owe 100 bucks.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.840]   Okay, pay that."
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.920]   Then the second one comes in and I look at it and it says, "Two dollars that we sent
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.080]   in last month was applied to principal and $100 went to interest."
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.240]   I'm like, "What?
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.280]   I sent you $100 and my bill has only been deduced by or deducted by two bucks?"
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.640]   I was floored.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.080]   At that point, when you have these situations in your life, you can either get angry or
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   upset.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   I got angry.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   I was like, "Whoa."
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.000]   At that point, I was like, "All right, I'm going to pay off these bills as fast as I
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   possibly can."
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   I ended up knocking them out in about two and a half years even though they gave me
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   10 to pay them all off.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.700]   Your story, I read about what you had on your website where you paid off your loans before
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.700]   you even got out of college.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   Awesome for you.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   Thanks.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   Congratulations on that.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.760]   For me, it took a longer period of time to do that, but it was that realization, well,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.840]   this interest thing, got to pay attention to that.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.520]   What did you do for work?
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.720]   Because you've done a number of different things and now you're starting to get into
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.560]   the personal finance discussion space.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   Sure.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.280]   I have a computer science degree.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   I was in the technology world for a number of years.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.720]   I worked for a dot-com startup as well.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   Then I moved over to the more entrepreneurial role, having some business partners, still
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   working in technology and the online business world.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.320]   I've been doing that since then.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.040]   My story is, I wouldn't say it's identical to Clark Howard's, but I sold a business last
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.960]   year and it enabled me to "retire."
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.560]   At this point in my life, I'm able to do what I want, kind of like what Clark did.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.640]   His story is, I retired, I was sitting on the beach, and then I got this travel show.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.680]   For me, it was, "Well, I have this opportunity.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.160]   Let's do something I really love."
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.600]   Talking about personal finance, because I've been so interested in it since I came across
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.200]   him many, many years ago.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.800]   Let's talk about the business.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.560]   What was the business journey like?
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.120]   It was very difficult.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.520]   It was a lot of hours.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.280]   People should know when you're running your own business, let's not sugarcoat it.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   It's tough.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.400]   It's a lot of hours.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.000]   My success came from holding down a full-time job during the day, and then I would build
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.440]   my online business at night, on the weekends, taking vacations, and spending time on my
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   business.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600]   Throughout over the years, I've had eight companies total, but the pattern would always
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   be the same.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.400]   I'd build one company, then I would work on that during the daytime, and I'd start a second
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.680]   company in the evening, or on the weekends, and on vacations.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.400]   Keep on doing that over and over again.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   You're being very vague with the online marketing.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   Are you not allowed to talk about it?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   No, I can tell you about it.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   Can you give me some more specifics?
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   Sure.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.320]   The first company I started was a couple business partners.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   We taught people about wireless networking, computer networks, taught them to go into
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.100]   hospitals and schools, office buildings, how to hook up a wireless network.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.120]   Another company I had, the most successful one, the one I sold last year, was green building
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   education training.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.120]   We taught architects about green building, energy efficiency design, continuing education.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.600]   That was all online as well.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.080]   Had a couple off-shoot weird companies as well.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.960]   My wife and I produced a DVD on how to toilet train your cat.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   Wow.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.040]   Did you make money?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.040]   We made a little bit.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.700]   Not enough to call it a success.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700]   We learned a lot.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.480]   Do your cats actually get on the toilet seat and sit up?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.540]   They used to, yes.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.540]   They used to.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.560]   We moved around a number of times, and now they're outdoor cats for part of the day,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   so that makes it a little bit easier.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.240]   I have a certified financial planner myself, and he says, "You didn't fail at the business.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   You got an education."
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   There you go.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   So, very positive spin on it.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.240]   I do often think about that.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:00.640]   If we were to take the amount of money that we put into tuition at colleges and schools,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.520]   formal schools, if we were to take that and we were to invest that money into a business
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.160]   or starting a series of businesses, recognizing that we might lose it all, and then at the
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.360]   end of, say, five years, we were to compare the amount of knowledge and wisdom that we
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.700]   gained from five years in school or five years in business, I'd put my money behind the business
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.440]   being a pretty good use of the money for the price of the education, even if it was all
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   lost.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.440]   Yes.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.720]   Nowadays, especially with the cost of tuition skyrocketing, I mean, it's crazy from when
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   I went to school.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.840]   As my wife says, my wife went to TCU, Texas Christian University, which is here in Fort
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.080]   Worth, and she likes to say, "I couldn't afford to go to TCU now because the cost has gone
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   up so much."
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.520]   Yeah, especially the private schools, definitely.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   So, how old are you now?
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   I am 42.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.280]   And you consider yourself financially independent?
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.640]   That is awesome.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.440]   So from not paying attention at 21, 22, you graduated to 42, about 20 years, you've been
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.640]   able to build it.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.280]   How does it feel, man?
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   It's amazing.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.920]   I get to work because I want to work, which is...
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Hey, pickle man.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:16.200]   There's a giant green pickle standing in front of our table from the Podtainment magazine.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.960]   Financial freedom is amazing.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   I get to...
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.640]   I don't call what I do now work, and I haven't for a long time because I do what I'm passionate
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.520]   about, but I get to work because I want to work, not because I have to work.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.160]   That's my definition of financial freedom or "retirement."
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.040]   It's different for everybody.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.080]   I get to hang out with my kids during the day.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   I have twins.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   How old are they?
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.240]   I have twins, and they're about to turn two in October.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   So I get to get them up in the bed in the morning.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.840]   We get to hang out during the day.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.440]   They are in daycare a few days a week to get them out of our hair, and so they can learn
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.080]   Spanish and other little things that they teach them at daycare, make a mess so that
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.440]   we don't have to clean it up.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.120]   But we get to do stuff during the day.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.520]   I get to see my wife.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.160]   I've worked from home for 12 years now, being an entrepreneur, which has been great.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   You save a ton of money working from home.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.600]   You can make your own lunch every day.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   At what stage of your business journey did you start to think about financial independence?
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.000]   The interesting thing is I never did because when I started my first company with the business
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.480]   partners that approached me, I had a specific set of skills they needed to build their business.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.440]   I knew how to build websites, and they did not, so they gave me part of the company in
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.240]   order to join it and work on the website.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   I was just so ecstatic and happy to be building websites, and there was no money.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.960]   We had no money to start coming into the company.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.840]   It wasn't, "Well, I'm doing this to make more money.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.320]   I was doing this because, oh, I get to build websites."
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   That's exciting.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   Really, through the years, it was always, "Oh, I get to start a new company," or, "We've
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   got this new idea.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.200]   Well, we might make money, but we can go have fun in doing it anyways."
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.840]   It was really the passion that drove it to me, and the money was just a byproduct.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.120]   It wasn't, "All right, we're going to start this.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   In 12 months from now, we're going to be making X dollars or trying to be making X dollars."
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   Never even crossed my mind.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.720]   Some businesses I had were successful.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.320]   Some were not, but they were always because I wanted to do it, and it was fun.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.000]   What's your plan now?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.060]   Setting up the finances to provide for an income from 42 is very different than doing
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.540]   it at 72.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.680]   What's your big picture financial plan for how you're going to provide your income off
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.160]   of your nest egg?
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Sure.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.680]   Some of that, right now, we do not have any rental homes, so we're looking at getting
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.560]   some rental homes, be able to have some passive income from that later on in life.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   We've accumulated enough and invested enough and done enough smart things.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.200]   We've lived way below our means.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.760]   I've been married for 10 years, and I say, "So we."
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.200]   I'm talking about my wife and I.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.400]   We've always lived way below our means from the income that we've had over those years,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.240]   been able to save it up.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.880]   So really, we can live off what we have for a really, really long time and not have to
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.280]   tap into that for decades if we didn't want to.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.780]   During the time you've been married for 10 years, so you would have been partway through
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.840]   this journey of building these businesses, did your wife have money when you married?
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.720]   No, she did not.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:26.760]   Myself, when we met, I was working full-time at a corporate job, and then I was building
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.160]   my business on the side.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.240]   Right before I met her, I decided I was going to go full-time on my own business, and I
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.340]   took a 65% pay cut in order to do that.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.400]   So when I met her, I was actually not making hardly any money at all.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.800]   I mean, it was making really not much.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.200]   And then she had just graduated from college.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.240]   Her grandparents paid for her schooling, but she had an auto loan.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   Other than that, she didn't come into the relationship with any money either.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.720]   So we're kind of starting it with not much when we got married.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.560]   Did you have money at that time?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.400]   Did you have savings, or you were still in the, "It's all in the business, and maybe
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.760]   I'll sell these things one day"?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.880]   I had an emergency fund because I had been listening to Clark Howard for probably a couple
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.360]   years at that point.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.900]   So I had my six-month emergency fund.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.640]   When we got married, she had a townhouse.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.680]   I owned a house, and we decided, "All right, I'm going to sell my house, and I'll move
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   in with you," so she could be closer to her work.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.520]   From the sale of that house, I had a good chunk of money that came in from that because
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.760]   the housing market was huge at that time.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.280]   People were overpaying for houses, kind of like they are now.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   It was prior to the housing bubble burst.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.800]   Did she share the financial independence vision with you?
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   What was it like working through that?
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.160]   Because I just know that even in talking with my wife, as we talk about our financial plans
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   and goals, it's unusual that couples share the financial independence vision, at least
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   in the beginning.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.680]   Usually, it's often one person, and then we're going to do it.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   There's a lot of work involved.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.960]   I mean, you've been working your tail off for two decades, or at least a decade and
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.280]   a half, once you kind of started to get things established.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.200]   It's not easy to live a life where all your friends are going out every night, and everyone's
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.920]   hanging out, and here you are working 40 hours, and then at this time, you quit.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.000]   But here you are working morning, noon, and weekend.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.680]   What was that like as far as your relationship?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.760]   Part of what helped us is we had similar backgrounds and upbringing.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.600]   We both came from small, rural towns, population 2,000, each of us different parts of the country.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.440]   Our parents were generally middle class.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.480]   My wife's dad was a pastor.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.640]   My dad worked for, we called him the road boss.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   He worked for the town for a number of years, so very modest backgrounds.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.840]   Neither of us grew up with a lot of money.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.240]   We had beater cars during high school.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.640]   So from that standpoint, we came from a background of we don't have fancy clothes, we don't have
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.600]   fancy cars, and we're used to not going out to eat or going on expensive vacations.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.360]   And that's the mindset we had when we came into the marriage, very similar backgrounds.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.000]   We're kind of comparable.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   Now after I sold my house and we were combining incomes, we did have a pretty good chunk of
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.960]   savings from that.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.400]   I think my wife, we won't call it that she nagged me, but for several months she said,
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.320]   "We need to get somebody to help us with this.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.280]   We need to get a third party involved to help us, guide us, and manage our finances."
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   And at that point we met with a certified financial planner who agreed to take us on
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.280]   even though we were nowhere near the income level that they typically require, the level
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.640]   of wealth that people want to manage.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.880]   He was fairly new to his company as well, I think that helped with the situation.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.000]   And we sat down with him.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.400]   He really helped us lay out our goals, say, "Here's what you can do with your money."
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.960]   I learned about nesting, how women need to nest and make the house look nice.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.880]   So he said, "You can afford to give Katie $1,000 to decorate."
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.520]   I was like, "All right, well, we can keep this ugly looking couch and why do we need
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   pictures on the wall?
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.840]   We don't need pictures on the wall."
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.320]   I think how you learn that when you move into a place and you're settled there and you learn
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.000]   that it's not all about how many dollars in the bank account.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.320]   It's also about how beautiful your house looks and that the level of contentment that comes
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.160]   in a marriage from that is worth far more than a thousand bucks.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.280]   Happy wife, happy life.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   Absolutely.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.680]   If you were going back, what's your message?
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.840]   What's your core message now?
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.840]   You're moving into this space of talking about finance.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.760]   What do you have to share that you think is missing out there?
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.360]   I'm trying to educate the people that were in my position early on.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.760]   They don't know about money.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.920]   They don't know about debt.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.020]   They're not familiar with interest rates, how to go out and buy a car.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:01.080]   I got into trouble with car loans, so I try to teach people, "Pay for a car with cash
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.600]   if you can, but if you're not, here's how to at least get the best interest rate."
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.300]   I'm trying to reach out to the younger Scott Turners that are out there that might be listening,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.480]   but they don't want to hear from a guy who's wearing a suit and tie or a collar shirt and
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.620]   jacket, which is just not my style.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.640]   If you were going to go back and speak to the 18-year-old you, what would be the specific
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.780]   steps that you would give them to say, "Do these things to achieve financial independence
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.440]   by 40"?
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.500]   The first thing I like to tell people is you've got to have goals, and they've really got
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.920]   to be written down.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.220]   Our financial planner asked us to do this when we first got married.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.640]   He said, "Write down a bunch of goals.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   What are your five-year goals?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   What are your 10-year goals?"
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   We did.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.840]   It wasn't until a couple years ago, I actually went back and pulled them out and realized,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   "Holy cow, we've actually achieved these goals."
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   Isn't that the craziest thing?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   I know.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.960]   Some of them were just off the wall.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.600]   I had always wanted to go to Egypt, and I had completely forgotten about it.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   I'm pulling out this thing.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.760]   It's like, "Oh, we actually went to Egypt."
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   Writing down goals, and there's been studies about when you write down goals, you review
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.240]   them, you're more likely to achieve them.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.040]   I know it's hard for everybody because it seems like such a weird concept.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.520]   "What do you mean I've got to write stuff down?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   Why can't I just do it?"
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.400]   There's this strange power in doing that.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.160]   It does something in your mind.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.840]   The chemicals do something.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   Whatever happens.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.760]   When you're writing it down, you look at it periodically, even if it's once a month, every
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   six months, you're more likely to accomplish those things.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.200]   Number one is just write down your goals.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.880]   Number two is, and it's thrown around all the time, it's really spend less than you
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.000]   earn, live below your means, don't wipe out every paycheck as it comes in.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Do it.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.040]   Automate your savings.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.400]   If you've got a 401(k), put money in your 401(k).
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   If not, go out and set up an individual retirement account.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.720]   Get started with a Roth IRA.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.960]   You don't have to have the nicest clothes.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.560]   You don't have to drive a BMW as soon as you get out of college, or a brand new Toyota,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.280]   or a brand new car at all.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.520]   You can drive your Beater for a number of years.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.960]   If you do just those couple things, that puts you ahead of half the country, half the world,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.680]   who just blows all their money.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.000]   Did you shoot for a specific percentage of your income to save?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I did.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.600]   When I first started listening to Clark Howard, his message was, "Save 15% of your income."
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.520]   That's what I tried to set aside, 15 to 20%.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.880]   As I got bonuses or raises, I would try to increase that because I had a very modest
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.440]   level of living when I was single.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.680]   I did have a home and a mortgage, but I brought my lunch to work every day.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.120]   I didn't go out to eat a whole lot.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   Part of that ties into working all the time.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.780]   I didn't have a ton of friends, but really, from the time I got out of college, throughout
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.600]   my entire corporate life, I can count on two hands the number of times I actually went
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.480]   out and bought lunch.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.320]   I brought my lunch to work every day and it allowed me to save thousands and thousands
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.200]   of dollars.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.400]   Your life sounds absolutely miserable to many people.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.760]   How do you answer them?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.200]   It may, but I always did what I loved.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.740]   I loved to program.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.760]   Even though I was working 60, 70, 80 hours a week, I never considered work.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.600]   If you think, maybe you're a musician and you love playing music, and you play music
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.400]   and get to practice that all day long, is it really work?
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.160]   If you're in a symphony or something, if that's your job, or whatever else you may happen
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.680]   to do, a lot of people are stuck in jobs that they hate.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.880]   For you to say, "Well, you got to work 60, 70, 80 hours of work."
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.120]   Yeah, if you're in a miserable job, it does sound miserable, but if you're doing what
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.560]   you love, it's not miserable at all.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.160]   It's not work.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.840]   To me, it was never work.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.560]   When I started these companies on the side, and I would not make any money for years at
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.400]   a time, I didn't care because I was doing what I loved.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.800]   I was sitting at a computer, writing code, which is not for everybody, but I have the
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.440]   mindset of, to me, it wasn't work.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   I was solving puzzles.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.400]   I was playing games.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.320]   I was making creative things, using my creative mind, which is what I was wired for.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.900]   Like what I'm doing now, I spend my days writing blog posts or working on podcasts, tweaking
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.140]   my website or doing the graphics around social media.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.140]   It's not work.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.140]   If I thought it was work, I wouldn't do it.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.360]   I'd go sit on a beach and drink margaritas.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.040]   Scott, thanks for coming on.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.480]   This has been awesome.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   Give everyone your website, your podcast.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.480]   Give everyone any info that you want to share with them.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   Sure.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:39.040]   My website is ScottAllenTurner.com, A-L-A-N, and I can be reached on Twitter @ScottAllenTurner
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   as well.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.680]   So, it is @ScottAllenTurner on Twitter?
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   Yes, it is.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   Cool, man.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   Thanks so much.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.000]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.720]   Mix a little hard work with a little entrepreneurism, entrepreneurialism, entrepreneurship.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.520]   I'm not sure of the right word.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.700]   But mix a little hard work in with some entrepreneurial endeavors.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.400]   Mix a lot of savings and some careful spending decisions in and you can set yourself up in
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   a pretty cool place.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.720]   I'll tell you, I'm 30 years old.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.120]   I wish I'd done it when I was 20.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.920]   I wish I was sitting here financially independent.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.280]   Plan is by 40 or sooner, I think I'll be there.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.360]   But right now, I'm not there.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.800]   Kind of wish I were.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.680]   So if you're 20 years old and you're listening to Radical Personal Finance or if you're 13
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.480]   and I'll have one 13-year-old listener who emailed me or shot me a message one time and
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.160]   said they listened, pay attention to stories like this.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   And hey, guess what?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:45.040]   If you're 30 or 60 or 70, pay attention to stories like this.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   You take it from there.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.960]   I guess paying attention isn't the only step.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.320]   You got to actually do something.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.160]   But hey, do something, would you?
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.700]   I'll let you decide today what you want to do.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.160]   Thank you all for listening to these interviews.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.840]   We'll be back from the Interview Blitz starting in October.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:09.440]   It's the Interview Blitz while I am away out of town at XYPN and FinCon.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.560]   Also while I'm working with my family and kind of getting some things caught up with
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   the show.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.400]   My plan is October we should be back to the more normal ebb and flow of the show with
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.880]   fewer interview shows.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.680]   We'll see if that happens, but that's the plan as this is being pre-recorded.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   It's going to happen.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.720]   Of course, no good plan survives contact with the enemy.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.240]   So I guess tune in in October and you'll see.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.680]   Thank you to each and every one of you who support the show.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.760]   Please consider if you're not, please consider going to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.160]   signing up to be a patron of the show, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:46.560]   The big goal around here is 250 patrons total by the date of September.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   By the way, in case you think that your contribution there doesn't matter, you might know that
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.480]   fewer than 5% of you listening actually support the show.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.200]   So most of you just listen, which is fine, but very few of you support the show.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.640]   So each and every one of you who does makes a huge difference for me and my ability to
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.000]   continue to bring you in-depth, high-quality content.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.520]   I'd really love to keep doing that.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.080]   So please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and support the show.
