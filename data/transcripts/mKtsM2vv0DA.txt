[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind Ethereum and cryptocurrency, perhaps
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:16.200]   it'd be nice to talk about the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.760]   You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.960]   actually invent?
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.760]   Maybe you could say who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:36.440]   Sure. So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.640]   with Bitcoin. So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is an anonymous
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:51.160]   fellow who has shown himself to us only over the Internet, just by first publishing the
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.480]   white paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.680]   talking to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and interacting with them
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   and helping the project along for a couple of years.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.960]   And then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011, he disappeared. So Bitcoin is a fairly
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   unique project in how it has this kind of mythical, kind of quasi-godlike founder who
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.720]   just kind of popped in, did the thing, and then disappeared and we've somehow just never
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.800]   heard from him again.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.040]   So in 2008, so the white paper was the first, do you know if the white paper was the first
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   time the name would actually appear, Satoshi Nakamoto?
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   I believe so.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.280]   So how is it possible that the creator of such an impactful project remains anonymous?
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's a tough question.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.960]   There's no similarity to it in history of technology as far as I'm aware.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.160]   So one possibility is that it's Hal Finney, because Hal Finney was also active in the
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.320]   Bitcoin community as Hal Finney in those two beginning years.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.280]   Who is Hal Finney?
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.320]   He is one of the people in the early Cypherpunk community. He was a...
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   So he was a computer scientist, just one of the first...
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   Yeah, computer scientists, cryptographers, people interested in technology, internet
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.240]   freedom, like those kinds of topics.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.760]   Is it correct that I read that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   or the first transaction of Bitcoin?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.120]   Yes, the first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and Hal Finney.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.200]   Do you think he knew who Satoshi was?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.080]   If he wasn't Satoshi, probably no.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.600]   How is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560]   about their fundamental identity?
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.240]   Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.840]   If we were to think about it, because you and I just met now, there's a depth of knowledge
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.400]   that we now have about each other that's physical.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.960]   My vision system is able to recognize you.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.240]   I can also verify your identity of uniqueness.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.640]   It's very hard to fake you being you.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.240]   So the internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   Can you maybe talk to that?
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   This is definitely interesting.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.480]   I definitely just know a lot of people just by their internet handles.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.520]   To me, when I think of them, I see their internet handles.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.240]   One of them has a profile picture as this face that's not quite human with a bunch of
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.320]   psychedelic colors in it.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   When I visualize him, I just visualize that.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.640]   That, not an actual face.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.240]   You are the creator of the second, well, at least currently the second most popular cryptocurrency,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   Ethereum.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.760]   So on this topic, if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer, you may
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.960]   be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.240]   about.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   Your identity is known.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   Yes.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.480]   I've just verified it.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.280]   But from your perspective, what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   anonymous?
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.880]   If we can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto, is there something interesting there?
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.080]   Or is it just a peculiar quirk of him?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:47.480]   It definitely helps create this image of this neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.920]   You created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also disappear or as unfortunately
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.800]   happened to help any, if that is him, he ended up dying of Lou Gehrig's disease and he's
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   in a cryogenic freezer now.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:13.520]   But if you pop in and you created and you're gone and all that's remaining of that whole
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.640]   process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:30.920]   behavior and try to understand like, oh, this person wrote this thing in some essay at age
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.560]   16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so because of that, this project is a statement that's trying to do this specific
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   thing.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.360]   Instead, it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.720]   It doesn't have the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.840]   So now that we're sitting with you, do you feel the burden of being kind of the face
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   of Ethereum?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.560]   I mean, there's a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, is there like
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   a burden associated with that?
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.200]   There definitely is.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.960]   This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.280]   to become more decentralized in many ways.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.520]   Just encouraging a lot of kind of core Ethereum work to happen outside of the Ethereum foundation
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.720]   and of expanding the number of people that are making different kinds of decisions, having
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.360]   multiple software limitations instead of one and all of these things.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.160]   There's a lot of things that I've tried to do to remove myself as a single point of failure
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.560]   because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.120]   So if you look at the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems that it's
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.560]   like a sad reality when I think about it.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.480]   It seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor often, if you look at Linus for
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   Linux, for the kernel.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   That is possible.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.360]   I'm definitely not planning to disappear.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:22.040]   That's an interesting tension that projects like this kind of desire a single entity and
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.440]   yet they're fundamentally distributed.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.600]   I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.720]   about the future of cryptocurrency.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   Does there need to be a leader?
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   There's different kinds of leaders.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.560]   There's dictators who control all the money.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   There's people who control organizations.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   There's high priests that just have themselves and their Twitter followers.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.360]   What kind of leader are you, would you say?
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   These days, I'm actually a bit more in the high priest direction than before.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.080]   I definitely actually don't do all that much of going around and ordering Ethereum Foundation
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.360]   people to do things because I think those things are important.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.280]   If there's something that I do think is important, I do just usually say it publicly or just
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.080]   say it to people.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.000]   Quite often, projects just start doing it.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Thank you.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Thank you.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Thank you.
