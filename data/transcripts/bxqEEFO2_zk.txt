[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   On Wednesday, we were in Holland.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.700]   Today in Brazil.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.600]   We're blessed with many friends in Brazil
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.200]   and today's email comes from one of them,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.040]   a man named Kawa, spelled C-A-U-A
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   with a tilde on the last day.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.060]   Kawa, Kawa lives in Rio de Janeiro.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.720]   Hello, Pastor John, I have been debating
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.180]   the following question in my head for a long while.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.800]   Does God command our praise because it glorifies him
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.160]   or does he command our praise
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   because he wants us to be happy?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.080]   Does he command our worship for himself
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.200]   or for our good or for both?
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.660]   Can you help me understand this please?
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.800]   Well, I will do my best because this is what
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.260]   I've been trying to do for more or less 50 years.
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120]   I think the answer to this question
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120]   is just about the best news in all the world.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.920]   At least in my own experience to see the relationship
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.840]   between God's command for praise
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.600]   and my experience of happiness
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.240]   was one of the most important discoveries
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.100]   that I ever made in my life.
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.160]   So I hope I can bring some clarity to it.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.640]   I don't think there was any biblical text
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.500]   that my parents spoke to me or wrote to me
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.920]   after I left home more frequently
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.840]   than 1 Corinthians 10 31.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.400]   So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   That command, that duty was imprinted on my soul
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.260]   from as early as I can remember
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.480]   and I am so thankful that it was.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.520]   It was a wonderful thing.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.000]   Whether you're young, whether you're old,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.200]   to have a short pithy summary
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.480]   of the purpose of human existence.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.240]   What a gift to know why you exist,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.080]   to know why you are on this planet.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.240]   Indeed, to know why there is anything at all in existence.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.060]   What a gift, what a privilege.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.560]   And it became obvious over time
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.340]   that this wasn't simply my duty
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.600]   to glorify God in everything I do,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   but this was God's design for his own action, all of it.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   He does everything.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.960]   He does everything he does to the glory of God.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   He predestines to the glory of God.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.800]   He creates to the glory of God.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   He guides history to the glory of God.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.320]   He sends Jesus to live and die for the glory of God.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.220]   He sanctifies his church to the glory of God.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.480]   Jesus is coming back to be marveled at
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   and glorified among his people.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   Everywhere in the Bible, God is glorifying God.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   He does what he does to make God himself look as beautiful
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.960]   and glorious and great and wise and just and good
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.520]   and loving and gracious as he really is.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   So the duty that I grew up with expanded
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.620]   into a full-blown view of the universe.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120]   I think that's really there in 1 Corinthians 10, 31,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.280]   because text after text pointed
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.240]   to the ultimate purpose of all things,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.720]   namely God is committed to glorifying God.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   And I remember seeing, this was in I think 1976 or so,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.800]   I remember seeing for the first time
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.120]   those three verses in Ephesians 1,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.680]   verse 6, verse 12, verse 14,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.680]   all three of them saying unto the praise of his glory,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   unto the praise of his glory,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.120]   unto the praise of his glory,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960]   as if Paul were to say, hey, to get it the third time,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.200]   if not the second, if not the first time,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.880]   God does everything and he saves especially,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.720]   unto the praise of his glory.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.600]   So there's absolutely no question
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.160]   how to answer the first part of Cowan's question.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   Does God command our praise because it glorifies him?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.720]   Yes, you are chosen, destined, adopted, redeemed
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   unto the praise of the glory of God's grace, Ephesians 1, 6.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.200]   God plans for our praise, creates for our praise,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.680]   rules the world for our praise,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.440]   saves us through the death of Jesus for his praise,
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   and that praise is specifically praise ultimately
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.680]   for the glory of God's grace.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.160]   Now that vision of God's God-centeredness
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   in creation and redemption, salvation, all of history,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   that God-centeredness of God himself
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.740]   left me for a long time perplexed
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.840]   about the place of my happiness,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   my happiness in this overarching divine purpose.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.540]   My perplexity was compounded when I heard preachers,
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.840]   for example, during a call to missions,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.400]   say things like, "Seek God's will, not your own.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.440]   Seek to please God, not yourself."
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.640]   And I knew there were texts in the Bible
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.360]   that said things like that, but it left me wondering,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.000]   well, will it always be the case
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.840]   that when I'm acting in obedience,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   I'm acting against my will and against my pleasure?
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.720]   That seemed hopeless to me.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200]   As if you were to grow in your obedience
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.220]   and be condemned to unhappiness the rest of your days
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.840]   or eternity even.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.000]   Then came the great discovery.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.480]   It came from several sides,
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.280]   but the most shocking and compelling statement
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.840]   of the discovery was in C.S. Lewis's book,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.280]   "Reflection on the Psalms."
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   He not only nailed my confusion, my perplexity,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.560]   but in doing so, he gave the answer to it.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.620]   So I want you to hear what I heard.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   So I'm gonna read the whole section, a couple of paragraphs.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.240]   And remember, what he's dealing with here
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.280]   is that parts of the Bible, especially the Psalms,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   sounded to him when God commanded his own praise.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.040]   He said it sounded like an old woman seeking compliments,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.940]   and that really bothered him.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.520]   So here's what he wrote.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   And this was life-changing for me.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.840]   "But the most obvious fact about praise,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.200]   whether of God or anything, strangely escaped me.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.760]   I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval,
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.440]   or the giving of honor.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.640]   I had never noticed that all enjoyment
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.560]   spontaneously overflows into praise,
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.120]   unless, sometimes even if, shyness
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.100]   or the fear of boring others
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.460]   is deliberately brought in to check it.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.880]   The world rings with praise,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.720]   lovers praising their mistresses,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.960]   readers their favorite poet,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   walkers praising the countryside,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.320]   players praising their favorite game,
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.000]   praise of weather, wines, dishes, actors,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.320]   motors, horses, colleges, countries,
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.880]   historical personages, children, flowers, mountains,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.960]   rare stamps, rare beetles,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720]   even sometimes politicians as scholars."
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.760]   I think he's laughing.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.600]   (chuckles)
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.480]   "I had not noticed how the humblest,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.800]   and at the same time, the most balanced
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.580]   and capacious minds praised most,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.580]   while the cranks and misfits and malcontents praised least.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.120]   I had not noticed either that just as men
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.700]   spontaneously praise whatever they value,
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.280]   they spontaneously urge others to join them in praising it.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.780]   Isn't she lovely?
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.540]   Wasn't it glorious?
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.480]   Don't you think that magnificent?
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   The psalmists, in telling everyone to praise God,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.040]   are doing what all men do
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.660]   when they speak of what they care about.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.640]   My whole more general," I'm still quoting,
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.620]   "My whole more general difficulty
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.620]   about the praise of God depended on my absurdly denying to us
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.680]   as regards the supremely valuable,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   what we delight to do,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.360]   what indeed we can't help doing
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.580]   about everything else we value.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.600]   I think we," and here's the nub of the matter,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   "I think we delight to praise what we enjoy
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   because the praise not only expresses,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.840]   but completes the enjoyment."
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.900]   Whoa.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.940]   It is, it's appointed consummation.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.520]   It's not out of compliment
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.200]   that lovers go on telling one another
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.520]   how beautiful they are.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   The delight is incomplete till it is expressed.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   That's Reflections on the Psalms, 1958, pages 93 to 95.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.740]   Do you see where that led me?
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.740]   Every time God commanded me to praise him for his glory,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.200]   he was commanding me to bring my pleasure in him
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.940]   to its fullest delight.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.800]   That's what he was commanding.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.120]   My pleasure in God is not complete
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.080]   unless it overflows in praise,
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   and my praise of God is not glorifying to God
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.460]   unless it is the overflow of pleasure in God.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.060]   God is not an egomaniac when he commands me to praise him.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.900]   He's acting in love because my praising him
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.820]   is the apex of my pleasure in him.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.100]   What a discovery.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.860]   So the answer to the question is,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.720]   we should not, we dare not choose
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   between praising God as an expression of the glory of God
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.640]   and praising God as an overflow of our pleasure in God.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.420]   We dare not choose between those or separate those.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.880]   And after 50 years of pondering this,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.840]   I don't know any better way to say it
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.480]   than God is most glorified in us
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.560]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   If we try to choose between glorifying God
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.160]   and being glad in God, we will fail at both.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.980]   The great discovery is that God has bound them together
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.100]   in his children forever.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940]   - Amen.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.840]   An essential discovery with ramifications into all of life.
