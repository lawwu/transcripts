[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Enjoying God and glorifying God.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Are those different things or are they the same thing?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's a really good question for you today, Pastor John, who joins us remotely over Skype today.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Here's the question as it comes in to us from a listener named Roland.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. I have a question about enjoying Jesus versus glorifying Jesus.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   It seems like enjoying Jesus Christ would look like fellowship and communion with Him,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   a relatively private matter between Jesus and me,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   but glorifying Jesus Christ sounds more like observable works and words that show the watching world His worth.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   These two things seem to feed one another rather than being the same thing.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But I've listened to APJ long enough to suspect that you'd reach a different conclusion,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   but I can't seem to piece this all together. Can you help me understand their relationship?"
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Well, not an entirely different conclusion. (laughter)
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Let's start with a quick clarification about everything else that follows, just to preempt a misunderstanding.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   When I speak of enjoying Jesus or glorifying Jesus,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I mean in both cases enjoying Him for who He really is and glorifying Him for who He really is.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I don't have in mind an enjoyment or a glorification of some popular notion of Jesus that is not who He really is.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So there, that's the beginning clarification.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Now, with that set up clarification behind us, let's begin with a hearty affirmation of Roland's thoughtfulness here.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Roland is right that glorifying Jesus and enjoying Jesus are not identical.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He's also right that enjoying Jesus is in its essence a private experience of the heart
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and glorifying Jesus in its essence is the offering of evidence to others that Jesus is glorious.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Now, given those two definitions, there is nevertheless at least one situation in which
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   enjoying Jesus and glorifying Jesus become one thing,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   namely in the situation where my heart can be seen by someone else, even though my body is totally inactive.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   For example, I might be a paraplegic with no muscles working at all, not even my facial muscles.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   If someone could see my heart in that situation and see my heart experiencing joy in Jesus,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   that joy at that moment would be an instance of glorifying Jesus,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   because my definition of glorifying Jesus was offering evidence to others that Jesus is glorious,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   and they'd be seeing that, and it would be evidence to them.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   My goodness, there's joy in there, and he can't move a muscle.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   How great must Jesus be?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And there are at least three others, three other persons who can always see my heart,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   namely God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So, if my heart is enjoying Jesus, at least three other persons see evidence that Jesus is glorious,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and glorious to me, because enjoying Jesus for who he really is,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   especially in times of suffering, is real evidence that Jesus is glorious,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   if someone can see it, and someone can always see it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   At least three persons can see it.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   There's another reason why enjoying Jesus and glorifying Jesus need to be distinguished.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   That is not treated as identical, and it's because there are ways that God is glorified,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   or Jesus is glorified by a person's existence, even when the heart of that person is not enjoying him.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   For example, Pharaoh was raised up by God to glorify God's power, which he did,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   but not by enjoying that power, but by simply being the object of God's powerful and righteous wrath.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So, Exodus 9, 16, God says, "For this purpose I have raised you up,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   to show in you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So, Pharaoh glorified God's power and name, but not because he enjoyed either of them,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   but because his destruction became the evidence of God's glorious power.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So, when I say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I'm not saying that God is glorified by a person's existence only when that person is satisfied in him.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   God was glorified by Pharaoh's existence. His life was an evidence to others that God is powerful.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But Pharaoh was not satisfied in God or his power.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So, the words "in us" are very important when I say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I realize, every time somebody asks me a question, I get more clarity about this.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I realize that with the words "in us," I have created a confusion, at least for Roland,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   namely that glorifying God might be something totally private in us,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   without giving any evidence to anyone outside of us that God is glorious.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And I'm trying to clarify, that's not the case. That's not what I mean.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I want to say glorifying God or glorifying Jesus always involves giving some evidence to other persons
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   that God is glorious, beautiful, valuable, great, satisfying.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Now let me make one more clarification, or take our clarification one step further.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I said earlier that enjoying God and glorifying God are not identical.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yet, the whole burden of my theology, Christian hedonism,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   is that any attempt to glorify God that is godly or spirit-guided or gracious or faith-rooted or pleasing to God,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   any attempt to glorify God must come from a heart that is at least in possession of a mustard seed of being genuinely satisfied in God.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   If our hearts are totally devoid of enjoying God, our hearts cannot attempt to glorify God in a way that pleases Him and makes Him look beautiful.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And the more fully our hearts are satisfied in God, the more fully God will be glorified in our outward behavior.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now when I say that, I'm thinking of Matthew 5.16 by way of illustration.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before others so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Now that fits perfectly with Raymond's comment that glorifying God sounds more like observable works and words
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   than a private inner experience. And that's what Jesus is saying here.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   People will see your good works and glorify God. Your good works will give visible evidence that God is glorious.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Now what Christian hedonism points out, relentlessly points out,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   is that good works done from a heart with no satisfaction in Jesus are not God glorifying good works.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They are not putting God's glory and God's worth on display.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Because the heart that is doing them feels no glory, feels no worth in God.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Thousands of unbelievers do that kind of good works, the kind that Paul described in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   "If I give away all that I have and deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing."
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Jesus did not admire these kinds of good works.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, you clean the outside of the cup."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   That means you do lots of good things. They look really good, squeaky clean good things.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And the plate is clean on the outside, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   So this outside veneer of good works is not coming from the enjoyment of God,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   but from greed, for money, for human praise.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And right here in Matthew 5, there is evidence that the good works which glorify God in verse 16,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   come from a heart satisfied in God.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Remember, Jesus had just said, what, four verses earlier,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And then he says this absolutely crazy and glorious thing.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So, your heart can rejoice in hardship, in persecution, because of the promise of heaven.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   You will be with God and you will be overwhelmingly rewarded and satisfied.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And then he says, "You're the salt of the earth. You're the light of the world."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Which I think means the world desperately needs the flavor and the brightness of people so satisfied in God,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   they can rejoice in suffering. That's a weird and glorious, beautiful kind of human being.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And then he says, "Let that salt be tasted. Let that light shine in your good deeds."
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That is, let the taste and the brightness of your God-satisfied heart be seen in your...
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Then your good deeds will have the flavor that really makes God look valuable.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So, God is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied in him means,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   both that the heart itself, when satisfied in God, is good evidence to God,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   who sees the heart, that he is glorious in your eyes.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And it means that the heart satisfied in God will produce a public brightness
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and a taste in the way it responds to suffering and in the way it does good deeds.

[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   This is a really important point Pastor John draws out of the text,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   a point we all need to see and embrace.
