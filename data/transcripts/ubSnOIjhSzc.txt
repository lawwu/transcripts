[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, happy Memorial Day for those of you who are listening in the States and hopefully
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.260]   enjoying a nice long weekend.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.560]   And thanks for joining us again on the Ask Pastor John podcast as we enter our week number
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.820]   280, week 280 in the life of this podcast.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.820]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.540]   So thank you for listening and being a part of this project.
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.180]   Thank you for your sustained interest over these years.
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.460]   Well, I recently ran a quick search of the APJ inbox for the words anxiety and anxious.
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.600]   And what I found is that these terms appear in 620 different emails, Pastor John.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.820]   Anxiety questions arrive for us every single week and they come in many different forms
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.420]   from many different people with many different stories.
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.060]   And I know Pastor John, you have some general thoughts on anxiety that you want to share
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.060]   here in the podcast.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.780]   So today I'll simply hand off the mic to hear from you on this theme more broadly about
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780]   anxiety.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.580]   Well, let me tell you a story with a twist, which really happened, happened to me about
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.820]   35 years ago, but it's a parable.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.340]   It really happened, but it's a parable.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.740]   It made such an impact on me that I remember it to this very day.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.140]   And it's intended, I believe, for me, and I hope for you, by God, to be instructive
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:37.860]   about anxiety and to help us live more free from the crippling and witness damaging effect
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.180]   of anxiety.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.100]   So back when Noel and I were in our mid-30s with three children at the time, we eventually
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.460]   had five, finances were really tight, and we were going over our budget at the end of
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.220]   several months.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.940]   And I knew I had to take some initiative here to do something.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.160]   So we attended a seminar that was held at our church, and we discovered that the culprit
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.240]   was the MasterCard, which we had in those days.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.220]   We couldn't stay on top of what we were using it for, so we cut it up into pieces.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.900]   Actually we saved one, and actually it worked.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.420]   We just absolutely stopped using a credit card, paid everything with checks and cash,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.860]   and therefore we could tell what was in our account.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.980]   Now I still carried this MasterCard, though I never used that, and we took it to California
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.320]   on vacation with the family, and I lost it.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.960]   And I had no idea where it was.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.420]   Could have been at the Seal Show in Sea World, or it could have been in a fruit shop in Tijuana
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.680]   where we had crossed the border to visit.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.880]   It could have been in who knows how many McDonald's, goodness gracious, and on the beach in Coronado,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.120]   California where the sand really is gold, and the condos sell for a one and a quarter
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.180]   million dollars.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.160]   We were swimming, not shopping.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.600]   But the wonderful thing is that this time I felt no worries at all, none.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.400]   Now mind you, this is not natural for me.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.280]   I am by nature a short-term pessimist.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.440]   Ask my wife.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.120]   And under ordinary circumstances, I would have concluded that someone had already charged
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.560]   the limit on my card, and we were in deep trouble, and I would usually get mad at myself
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.880]   or the family, take it out on somebody with frustration indirectly, and I would, yes,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   try to find some divine purpose that God was working through this, all the while struggling
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.000]   to be happy because I'm a Christian hedonist and I'm supposed to be happy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520]   This time it was different.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.440]   I felt no worries at all.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960]   I didn't get angry with anyone.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   I never felt any frustration.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.120]   I was happy the whole way through.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   What a victory.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.840]   The whole time it was lost, I went about my business as usual, trusted God, loved my family.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   And when I got back from vacation, there it was, in an envelope from Dr. Fuller, my former
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.720]   teacher, whom I had visited.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.080]   He had found it on the floor of his car and had dropped it to me in a letter.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.960]   Now you know what the secret to my happiness was?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.920]   I didn't know I'd lost it.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.360]   I never even looked in my wallet.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.160]   I didn't know it was gone.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:58.520]   And I stood there holding it in my hand and smiling, and I thought, "Just think of how
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   feisty I would have been if I'd known I'd lost it.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.600]   Think how depressed I would have been and worried and angry and frustrated and irritable."
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.360]   And the whole time, God was covering for me, and the card was safely on its way to Minneapolis,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.640]   and all my anxiety would have been useless, and all the damage I would have done to people
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   would have been absolutely unnecessary because everything was quite under control.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   Now I ask, "Is there not a parable in this for me?"
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   It's this.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   As soon as we discover we have a problem, God has already been working on it, and the
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.600]   solution is on the way.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.960]   Not always with this much ease and freedom from difficulty, but God is always at work
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.160]   with a solution, and it's already on the way.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.080]   I have seen it happen again and again in my life.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   A letter arrives with the solution to some problem, but just the day before, I had been
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.380]   discouraged and downcast, not knowing that the letter was already in the mail.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:32.280]   If we believe in the God of Romans 8:28, that all things—this sovereign God—works all
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.040]   things together for good for those who love him and are called according to his purpose.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:46.440]   If we believe in the God of Romans 8:28, we will remember that by the time we know a problem
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.400]   exists, God has already been working on it, and his solution is on the way.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.280]   And yes, he is already working on it before it happens.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:09.320]   It is fitting into a plan for our good, and therefore don't fret.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.640]   Cast all your anxieties on him.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.360]   They are as unnecessary as mine would have been for the lost MasterCard.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.600]   Thank you, Pastor John, for sharing this story with us.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.760]   This I think is now our tenth episode we've released on the theme of anxiety.

[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.760]   Until next time, we're going to talk social media and ask, "How can we tweet to the glory
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   of God?"
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.880]   Surely, we all have a lot to learn in using our new media for eternal purposes.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.360]   And John Piper always has challenges for us as we think through stewarding our social
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.040]   media to the glory of God.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040]   I'm your host, Tony Rank.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
