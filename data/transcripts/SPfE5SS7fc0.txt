[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   almost everyone in the AI space that I see with a microphone in front of them says,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   the US has to win the AI war. I don't know what that means. And if I guess as to what it means,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.400]   I don't think it's possible. Because it's an infinite game.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.120]   It's an infinite game. And no one that I talked to would argue, we're going to somehow prohibit
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.220]   them from moving forward in AI. Let's not forget, it wasn't that long ago that OpenAI,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.680]   they'll say borrowed or copied the innovation that happened at Google and DeepSeek. Like,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.400]   this is how innovation works.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:53.080]   Bill, great to be back in person. Good to see you, sir. That was fun last night. We have to give a
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.980]   little shout out to our friends Vinny and Bill Lee and some others who we got together with in Austin
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.120]   last night for some poker. I think you did all right last night. You had some winnings. And you
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.660]   had some more winnings. In fact, I brought you some flowers. This is for your Florida Gators.
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.640]   You bring you your flowers.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.120]   Thank you. I'm sure the listeners are tired of hearing. I started the last two podcasts,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.180]   one before the Sweet 16 and one before getting into the final four. And then,
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.360]   of course, everyone knows the Gators went all the way. I had a bunch of friends out. We spent the whole
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.980]   day month, the Monday of the game day on the river walk outside the team hotel, saw a bunch of old
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.420]   friends. I know fandom is a weird thing because you don't actually do anything. You just go along for
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.700]   the ride. But it creates a very special experience. And I'm super proud of what they did in that team
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.400]   and how they won. I had talked about it before. And it was dramatic, too. But it was a great time.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.980]   Just a great time. What have you been up to?
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.020]   Speaking of games, that was an exciting upset by the Warriors in game one over Houston the other night.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.560]   I hope our guys make a run at it this year. Certainly looks like they're a totally different
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.100]   team with Jimmy Butler on the team.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.860]   No doubt.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700]   I think they're 25 and four or something like that since the Jimmy Butler trade.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.240]   Completely.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.520]   I'll tell you, man, I'm thinking a lot. In fact, this is something you really drilled into me
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.200]   ages ago about thinking about just complex systems. When I look at all the things this new administration
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.940]   is trying to change simultaneously, you and I talked three months ago. I said I was worried about the
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.600]   markets. Discount rates had to go up. There was more uncertainty in the world. But when I start
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.860]   thinking about what's going on, what this administration is trying to accomplish, all at very large scale.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.580]   So think about this. Whatever you think about each one of these individual things, they're trying to
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.740]   totally transform global trade. So that's trade negotiations with 100 countries. We effectively
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.560]   have an embargo between us and China today. 140% tariff, export controls. And so we have to renegotiate
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.720]   that deal. Besant said today it really hasn't even started. That's going to be a slog. On top of that,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.540]   we have taxes. If we don't lock in the tax bill, it doubles at the end of the year. We have this
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.520]   reconciliation package. We have doge and deficit reduction. We have questions around the 10-year
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.780]   and whether or not deficit is going to actually be larger this year. We have the war in Ukraine,
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.720]   right, and lots of back and forth there. We have dealing with the volatile situation in the Middle
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.640]   East. I mean, it sounds like we were on the verge maybe of seeing an Israeli attack on Iran. And all
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.600]   of these things are happening simultaneously. And so one of the things that's just on my mind,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.100]   if you look at the discounted rate of dealing with any of them successfully, and then you multiply those
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.700]   discounted rates together, right, the probability that you're going to land this plane and just a really
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.460]   smooth landing, I think is challenging to see, right? We're going to have some wins. We're going
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.420]   to have some losses. And so today, I know we want to revisit some of these conversations around
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.420]   tariffs and free trade and these export controls and kind of where we are in the market. But I would
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.840]   just say, we're attempting something very high difficulty level. And if this administration is
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.120]   able to land the plane on all these, it will be quite an accomplishment.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.580]   Yeah. And you bring up complex systems. This is the reason I spend so much time down at the Santa
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.720]   Fe Institute because that's all we talk about. But a couple of features of those things that relate to
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.600]   exactly what you said. First, it's very hard to know which variables are dependent in a complex
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.380]   multi-variable system. And there may be one you don't know about that it flips and the whole system
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.820]   takes on a different shape. And this makes these things very hard to predict, which is why I don't
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.840]   like talking about macro for that exact very reason, that there's so many variables, it's very hard to be
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.380]   accurate and correct. And even if you are, it might just be by happenstance because you might not know
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.080]   the exact variable that caused it. So it is, it's difficult. And unfortunately, and I'll state again,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.540]   I don't like talking about macro, but we're kind of forced into it because the market and even the
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.420]   destiny of many of the high-tech companies that we would prefer to focus on seem to be caught up in
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.880]   this whole thing. For sure. For sure. I mean, I just saw a random tweet before we came in here,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.460]   you know, somebody estimating that the revenue hit to Meta this year from reduced advertising by
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.040]   the merchants, Chinese merchants on Meta like Timu is like $7 billion. Wow. Now think about that.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.360]   That's pure profit, right? There's no incremental variable costs against serving those advertisers.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.260]   So if that just disappears, you know, it's very, very high margin business. And so again, just the
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.540]   downstream consequences of small changes. It's a little less because they'll backfill with something
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.440]   else that may not pay as much credit. Yeah. You know, perhaps, but, but I think,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.600]   you know, what it reminds me is, you know, it feels like there's news every hour. It's pretty exhausting,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.800]   but we got to lock in, you know, there's a super busy calendar ahead. So why don't we start with
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.420]   just maybe updating where we are on, on, on tariff negotiations and revisiting, I think some important
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:22.320]   arguments about free trade. So last time we were together, we really framed this by saying on the one,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.080]   it seemed there were two different, you know, kind of sides in this administration. On the one side,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.740]   we had kind of a more tactical, narrow view of tariffs, maybe the Besant consensus, I called it,
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.540]   which was a fully loaded gun, rarely discharged, you know, and have targeted tariffs to re-onshore
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.580]   critical national industries. And on the other side of this, we had what I described as more the nuclear
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.000]   Navarro approach. This is that we generate trillions in tariff revenue.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.720]   That we tariff everybody, high structural tariffs, we replace the internal revenue service with the
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   external revenue service. And this is much more structurally different, not, not, not tactical at
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.260]   all. Well, where are we now? Markets are now down 15% during this period since, quote unquote,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.600]   liberation day on April 2nd. The markets are clearly worried about a global trade war.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:23.340]   We now have export bans. So China implemented an export ban on rare earths on April 5th.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:30.000]   We retaliated or at least implemented an export ban of our own last week on NVIDIA chips we'll get into.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.720]   And all of these bans and tariffs are quite controversial, even among Republicans. Remember,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.800]   the Republican Party on Capitol Hill has historically been against tariffs. And so I think there's an increasing
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.740]   concern on Capitol Hill about where all of this is headed and what it means for the economy.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.520]   And so many people are saying this is feeling quite chaotic. They're nervous about the tenure. They're
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.960]   nervous about the impact on the dollar. Besant's saying it's going to be a slog and this is going to
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.740]   take a while. But the president says on Friday, he thinks it'll all, you know, we'll have it resolved in
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.780]   the next three to four weeks. So what is your reaction to all of this? What I want to do is
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:14.020]   take it up a level because I think there's an important conversation. Republicans have historically
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:20.960]   been a party of free trade and lower taxes, right? I think of Reagan or Milton Friedman. And yet today,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.300]   there seems to be this growing consensus around tariffs. So let's just go back, make the case for
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.340]   steel man the case for why this may be a misadventure in the first place, Bill.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.300]   When we were talking at the beginning of this podcast journey about skilled immigration, we played
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:44.220]   a short clip from Ronald Reagan, which was one of his last speeches that he gave in office. And this week,
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.460]   with all this tariff discussion, there was another Reagan clip floating around that I think does just
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.620]   this great a job of kind of summarizing something in a very efficient way. So if you don't mind,
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.260]   let's play that clip real quick. And today, many economic analysts and historians argue that high
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:09.920]   tariff legislation passed back in that period called the Smoot-Hawley tariff greatly deepened the depression
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.340]   and prevented economic recovery. You see, at first, when someone says, let's impose tariffs on foreign
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.100]   imports, it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:29.220]   And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.420]   first, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:40.500]   They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.340]   to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:53.060]   High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.780]   The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:05.220]   So soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.060]   government, people stop buying. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:17.220]   and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. The memory of all this occurring back
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.740]   in the '30s made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.940]   legislation that destroys prosperity.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.340]   So, I mean, for me, you know, everything I learned up until this point in time
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:39.940]   is congruent with what Reagan said. You know, tariffs lead to increased inflation. They lead to reduced
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:47.220]   innovation. Putting a protective blanket over our companies in our country lead to them being less
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.660]   globally competitive. And then fourth, which you mentioned, you know, it leads to retaliation.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:59.780]   And, you know, I've just been kind of revisiting a lot of my priors. One of my favorite economists who
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:05.380]   spends time down at Santa Fe, Ricardo Hausman, put out a great piece who said, "We're not adding up
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.940]   everything the right way. We're only looking at physical goods, their services and intellectual
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:16.260]   property and net income that comes from companies like Metta operating around the globe." You know,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.740]   Neil Ferguson did an incredible hour with Barry Weiss that I would just tell everyone to go listen
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.980]   to. And every one of these things takes me back to what I learned over 20 or 30 years,
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.700]   that these things aren't going to work out in the long run. And so, I'm skeptical. I mean,
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.060]   I'm always open-minded to revisiting my priors. And if someone wants to put out an argument why this is
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:47.060]   all going to work. And you and I were talking earlier, but I find there's a lot of conflation
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:54.820]   going on, you know, about different reasons arguing for why different actions are happening. You know,
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:01.700]   the tactical, you know, we need to have these specific technologies, you know, be resilient so
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.820]   we're not overly dependent on one country to this bigger thing where we're going to replace all of
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.540]   tax income. And I think you could do a little bit of the first. The latter is just violates all my
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:20.900]   priors. So I'd have to start fresh and I'd have to be convinced that all these great thinkers that came
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:26.660]   before us were wrong. Right. You know, so if our friend David Sachs were here, and I think he brought
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:32.820]   you up on the All In Pod last week, if he were here, he would say, okay, free trade is all well
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.900]   and good. Very Jeffrey Sachs. But he'd bring up John Mearsheimer. And he would say, you know,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:44.980]   the reality is we're in a great power struggle. We have a peer rival in China, you know, today,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:51.780]   and that national security must take priority over free trade and might make the argument,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:59.380]   I think, that in particular, creating resilience in these industries, rare earths, you know, chip fabs
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:06.340]   in the United States, auto manufacturing, steel, aluminum, et cetera, are essential to our national
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.660]   security. And so therefore, it's not inconsistent with free trade. What would you say to that?
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.500]   Well, you know, we talked in the past, I think, to the extent you were doing something very tactical,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:24.260]   it could be proposed as such. The tone and the bravado of the description of what we're doing
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.460]   isn't consistent with that. There's also, if you're using the word resilient, you know,
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:35.220]   that can include other countries that are allies. It doesn't have to be on the shores of the U.S.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:40.500]   And I know people who, in the first Trump administration, were told to diversify away
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.540]   from China, and they built, you know, supply chains in Vietnam, and now they're, you know,
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.740]   worried about tariffs there. And so there's, there needs, we talked about this, but there needs to be
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.500]   a consistency in order for people to adjust to those things. Right.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.060]   One more piece I would mention, and we'll put links to all these things, is Thomas Friedman has
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:05.380]   an op-ed in the New York Times that says, "I just saw the future and it was not in America." You know,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:12.660]   he takes it further. He believes that in advanced manufacturing, we're not just not doing it here,
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:20.020]   but we're not on the cutting edge of what it would take to do here. If you recall back in a day and age,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:27.700]   when Japanese manufacturing and just in time was this huge thing where all of America was convinced
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.020]   Japan was ahead of us in auto manufacturing. And he says, "We need to adopt that philosophy about
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:42.980]   manufacturing in China." And he goes to the point of saying, "Look, we need to force them to do JVs here,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:49.540]   so we can learn from them." Yes. Now, no one's talking that way in the administration because
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:55.460]   there's so much vilification, there's no recognition of where they might be better than us. But, but
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:01.540]   those problems, I guess, the point I'm making is those problems are worth solving. But I, I'm still not
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:07.300]   convinced that we have a, I think we have a huge labor problem trying to be competitive in manufacturing.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.740]   Right. Neil makes a great point about the argument that, "Oh, we shouldn't have done this. We,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:20.900]   we regret global trade." That argument takes, you're allowing yourself to imagine, you're taking
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:27.780]   where we are today and competing with an imaginary version of how things evolved if we didn't embrace
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.900]   global trade. Right.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:34.420]   And assuming that we would have manufacturing and be in a better place. And I think that's,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.020]   he used the word fanciful, which I would agree with.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.500]   I mean, I might also argue, you know, in response to Mearshamer, it was an incredible debate last
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.940]   year at the All In Summit between Mearsheimer and Jeffrey Sachs, you know, that, and he comes
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:54.420]   out of the realist school of political international relations. And I think there's a lot of truth to
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.740]   it, right? I mean, you can't stick your head in the sand and pretend that we don't operate in an
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.860]   international system. In the middle of the Cold War in the 1970s, right, we had all sorts of embargoes
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:10.660]   on, on Soviet Russia that were probably smart embargoes. A lot of people think that what, you know,
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:17.140]   the historical telling is that what brought the wall down ultimately against Soviet Russia was
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:23.620]   that our economy was triumphant. And so I look at the situation today and I think what part of the
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:29.540]   problem is that it's not clear out of the White House what the goal and objective is, right? If the
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:36.740]   goal and objective is Navarro, then I think there's broad opposition within not only, you know, the
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.260]   Democratic Party, but also the Republican Party to the scale of tariffs and disruption that that's
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.140]   going to have on the economy. But I think it's fairly non-controversial that we should have tactic,
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:54.340]   narrowly tailored tariffs and tax subsidies and incentives in order to re-anshore some critical
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.940]   capabilities. You know, I mentioned a few, chip fabs, some pharma, critical rare earths in production.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.300]   I mean, we don't want to be dependent on the Chinese for whether or not we can produce an automobile or
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   whether or not we can produce a phone, you know, etc. And so I think that, I think that some of that makes a
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:19.140]   lot of sense to me. What doesn't make a lot of sense to me is that we launched what was kind of
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:26.820]   this nuclear-style tariff war against every country on the planet, right? And so just the sequencing of
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:34.500]   events here, I think is a bit confusing. It should not be this McKinley-style multi-trillion dollar
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.100]   tariffs if what your objective is, principally where the agreement is, is to re-anshore some of these
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.660]   critical industries. And what I think is missing from this, all we're talking about is tariffs,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.700]   right? We need to be talking about what is the accelerationist agenda that we're going to put
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.740]   together in order to get these chip fabs. There's a lot of things we can, we can put together AI funds,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.500]   we can put together tax incentives and other packages to get people to build, you know, to build here.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.980]   I think that gets lost in the conversation. If we think that this alternative path is all about this,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:13.380]   this re-anshoring bill, is that consistent, do you think, with the Reagan and Milton Friedman view
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.220]   of free trade? Like if it was, if it was more tactical like that?
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.420]   I think if it were more tactical, I'm, I'm, I'll probably push back on you and disagree. I don't think
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:29.620]   our current, um, democracy is set up in a way that's really good for, um, the country to deploy dollars to
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:36.020]   help industry. And I gave this speech at the original all in summit about regulatory capture.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:36.180]   Right.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.540]   And I just, I can't imagine that if our, well, first of all, the, the AI boom in the US has attracted more
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.780]   capital dollars than I've ever seen accumulated in the history of mankind. So why sprinkling a little
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.580]   more on would be helpful, but also you get into this game of picking winners and losers. Now,
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.020]   Friedman highlights, and I, and I think this is true, you know, the, the Chinese government
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:08.580]   is just much more successful at, at state involvement in innovation. And if you maybe
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:15.620]   go back to the space race or the Manhattan project, um, we were capable of kind of mustering forces in
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.980]   that way, but I haven't seen it done recently, like the past 40 or 50 years.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.540]   In many ways, in many ways, the private sector has done a more efficient job of, uh, you know,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:31.140]   of taking on the Manhattan, uh, project, you know, style projects. I mean, you look at what's going
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.820]   on in Abilene, Texas and Denton, Texas, you know, around, uh, building out incredible
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:42.500]   supercomputer clusters all done really without government involvement. And I think that's,
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.020]   you know, an efficient and preferred mechanism, uh, you know, where a lot of,
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.940]   to your point, there's a lot of capital available.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:53.220]   But there are areas where I don't think we will move forward much without government involvement.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:20:00.020]   A great example would be in energy. So, so, you know, as we talked about many episodes ago,
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:06.740]   you know, Korea and China are delivering fission nuclear at one fourth, the price we are.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.260]   And I think that Korea example, South Korea is very important because that is a democracy.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.860]   So here's one country that's, that's authoritarian, one that's a democracy, and they're both achieving
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:26.100]   it. Uh, and we are 4X over that. That's gonna require some type of government involvement to figure
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:32.100]   out why we can't build that better and faster. And to be fair, there's a lot of movement around
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.340]   the country, mostly at the state level about removing red tape as a, uh, as something in
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.020]   governor celebrate, which, which is helpful and, and may move us in this direction. So those,
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:50.100]   I tend to, if we're going to help something along, I think, I think figuring out why our
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:57.380]   government's become friction and mud and changing that is probably going to be more impactful than
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.820]   the government doing the work themselves or picking winners with capital.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:07.700]   We're, we're, we're quick to blame others around the world for our challenges, right? But I, I think
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.220]   we need to spend at least as much time accelerating ourselves. And part of that acceleration is getting
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.740]   rid of needless regulation. It's looking at our own systems and asking that question. Why does it cost
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.220]   4X more to build a fission reactor today in the United States than it does in South Korea?
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.020]   Hey, yeah, totally. And, and by the way, I, one thing you just spurred in my brain,
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.580]   I was listening. Friedman also did a podcast with, with Ezra Klein and yeah, I'm just going to steal
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:42.260]   his story. I don't know that it's true, but he says that when China attacks a new industry these days,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:48.420]   that they encourage a ton of startups. I didn't know this. He said, so when they went after solar powers,
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:53.220]   they encourage like a hundred startups. So rather than pick a winner, they give money to
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:59.780]   everybody. So in a, in a thousand flower bloom kind of way, and that those hundred compete their
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:07.540]   way down to five. And he said, there's a lot of fraud and grift and waste for the ones in the losers.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:14.260]   But what you get out of the five are, is something that's actually honed by a market force. And I
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:20.900]   don't think anyone that thinks about authoritarian China thinks about the state using market forces
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.500]   to get to a higher level of, of efficiency and production. But if, if what Thomas said is correct,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.140]   they're actually using this kind of competitive market force to hone the better players in these
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.780]   industries. Let's talk a little bit about, you know, I think a lot of things get conflated when
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.740]   we talk about tariffs. And one of the most important is export controls. You know, so an export control
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:51.060]   is effectively a license requirement that acts almost as an embargo on all trade in a particular good.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:57.700]   So on April 5th, China implemented this rare earth ban. And then we reciprocated last week with
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.660]   the ban on all Nvidia H20 chips, uh, going to China. So when you, when you look at the rare earth ban,
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.860]   and I have a list here of the materials that were banned on April 5th, and you have things,
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:17.620]   you know, that go in critical elements into magnets, samarium, terbium. And so these are
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:25.140]   about 60% of these materials are mined in China. Okay. So you do have other places on the planet that
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:33.220]   are, that are, uh, mining these rare earths. The problem is 90% of them are refined in China. When
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:40.820]   they banned those rare earths, um, these are the magnets that go into EVs, phones, computers, machines,
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:48.180]   of all sorts. This was called by some in and around the white house as a kill shot, a kill shot against
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.580]   the U S economy, um, that causes massive problems in industrial production. You know, when I think
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:03.300]   about, um, again, the destabilization that comes from over dependency on something like if every magnet
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.580]   that goes into every machine in the United States is coming from, from China, and now we've effectively
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:14.020]   banned it, even though the ban was in response to the tariffs by the United States, right?
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.860]   What is the off ramp to this? You know, I now see just this afternoon while we started recording the
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.780]   pod, Trump has said that, you know, he doesn't expect, uh, the, the tariffs to stay anywhere close
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.540]   to where they are in China. He doesn't think they're going to be zero, but they won't be anywhere close
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:36.260]   to where they are. You know, he's, and we see kind of a unilateral walking down of these tariffs,
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.940]   but these export bans are really dangerous, Bill. So what are your thoughts about an export ban,
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.580]   perhaps just compared to, uh, the tariff itself? Well, I mean, I go back to the Reagan video,
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:52.020]   right? He says this will eventually lead to retaliation and escalation. And, and
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:25:00.500]   the fact that this video was recorded, whatever eighties, what is that? Uh, 45 years ago, like,
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:06.020]   like, like this isn't a new perspective. So you could argue, oh my God, I can't believe this
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.580]   happened. Or you could say, well, if you studied history, you should have expected this to happen.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.460]   Right. In fact, there's this Milton Friedman video going around and he talks about retaliatory tariffs.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.620]   And he says, okay, let's say that somebody shoots a hole in the bottom of your boat.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:26.020]   Right. And so, you know, it's taking on water. A retaliatory tariff would be like you shooting
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.260]   another hole in the bottom of the boat. And then they shoot a hole in the bottom boat just sinks faster.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:37.140]   Yeah. Right. And he's saying, uh, you know, but in fact, what we did last week is the U.S. did ban
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.380]   H20s going to China. And this was a pretty controversial move. And in fact, I was, you know,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:49.460]   looking at some of the analysis that was done this week and the newly launched Huawei cluster matrix
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:57.860]   384 is China's competitor to the GB 200. So semi-analysis is out with, you know, an assessment of this and
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:05.140]   many others. And basically what they concluded is that Huawei is already on the frontier or near the
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.820]   frontier with respect to chips. In fact, one of the analysts on CNBC this week said, to be honest,
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:18.020]   we basically just handed the China AR market to Huawei anyway. Right. And as Bernstein analysts,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:24.660]   because they said what it effectively does is clears the decks for Huawei to have monopoly profits in
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:30.340]   China. They no longer have to compete with CUDA and NVIDIA in China, even though we were sending
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:36.900]   them the H20 was a nerfed chip, right? It was a chip that was two or three generations behind what we
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.420]   have in this country. But it was, you know, some people think of retaliation to the rare earths.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.620]   Other people think it's just part of, you know, the AI strategy to try to win the AI war against China.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:56.500]   Well, and let's just take the argument that it was a retaliatory move. How good must it feel to be
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.260]   NVIDIA and Jensen and the executive team there that you become a pawn in these games that you had
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:09.380]   nothing to do with creating, you know? And in fact, you designed this product specifically to meet
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:16.020]   the expert control rule that was in place before this one, which is very similar to this Vietnam thing
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:21.940]   that we were just talking about. So you can't be happy with that. I reposted when this all happened,
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:29.860]   a great video that Deirdre did over at CNBC, um, about how this will be good for Huawei. And I think if you
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:36.020]   asked Jensen, he would say, yeah, this is great for Huawei. And it's not just that you get an isolated
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.740]   market where everyone, but, but every participant in the AI market in China may have been working with
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:49.300]   NVIDIA. Now they start working with this and they all collectively help improve it over time. And,
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:56.180]   you know, there, I read one article that said that China's, you know, getting some of their very first
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   commercial planes off the ground. One of the reasons is they became reliant on Boeing and Airbus.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:09.220]   And so by, by denying your exports to a market, you increase the incentive they have to develop
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.340]   their own technology. Well, particularly when they have the capability of China. I mean,
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:17.140]   the fact of the matter is if they had no capability to develop it, it would be one thing, right? I think
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.900]   more like the, the, the race around nuclear arsenals, if you will. There's some countries that will never
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.900]   have the capacity to build said nuclear arsenal. But the fact of the matter is China is so close
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:34.100]   in this regard with respect to the H20s. From my perspective, it's a very close call. I don't
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:39.140]   think we should be sending GB 200s or cutting edge chips to China. I think that there's a legitimate
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:45.460]   national interest in, you know, quote unquote, staying out in front on AI. I think there's a debate
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.540]   to be had about that. That's where I come down on that side of the issue. But the H20s, it seemed to me,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:59.460]   was a very self-defeating way. I think that the competition with CUDA in China distracted the
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.500]   competition, denied the monopoly profits within China for these Chinese internet companies. There
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:11.460]   was some insinuation last week that Jensen was intentionally, right, skirting all of this,
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.140]   you know, these rules around China and that there was, you know, maybe 30 or 40% of all their sales were
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.660]   going into China. You know, as I look at this, I think we have to be really careful.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:32.100]   You know, I think that these tariffs all of a sudden, right, can find us in a place where we're
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:38.820]   demonizing. I think Nvidia and Jensen are national heroes for the work that they've done and the
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.100]   leadership they've given us in global AI, right, American success stories. Totally agree.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:52.980]   And this idea that somehow they comply with the exact attributes of the H20 prescribed by the US
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.940]   government. Prescribed, and I want to go back to that. You know, and then they sell those in China,
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.340]   and then after the fact we go back and somehow start demonizing them, I think is a very dangerous thing.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.380]   So when I gave that speech a while back on regulatory capture, I made the argument that
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:12.020]   when in America, inside of America, when we want to accomplish something through policy,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:17.380]   we gather a bunch of people and we get a bunch of ideas, and then we write some complex piece
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:24.100]   of legislation. And what I highlighted is that in many cases, it fails. And in some cases,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:31.860]   it spectacularly fails. So what does that mean? You get the exact opposite outcome from which the policy
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:39.060]   is intended to create. Now, the fact that this happens all the time inside of America is an
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   interesting fact, because in some ways, expert control is external regulation. So we're trying
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:52.740]   to implement a policy now, not just in a place where we control most of the pieces, but in a world where we
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:31:00.500]   we don't control many of the pieces. And then we expect that policy to work perfectly. And the
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:07.460]   problem is, you know, borders are porous, money finds a home, right? You know, I always tell people
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:13.860]   that try and build internet businesses, internet arbitrage is undefeated. And global markets kind of have the
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:19.940]   the same thing. Like we're just coming off of a remarkable, I would use the word spectacular again,
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:29.540]   spectacular failure of Russian sanctions, economic sanctions, right? So why do we think, oh, that didn't
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:35.620]   work, right? But I'm going to go do this and make it work. I heard people who said we have to ban
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:44.660]   H20 saying, oh, well, the Biden rules didn't work, they failed, right? So oh, so you mean global expert
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:50.500]   controls didn't work. So we're going to redouble them and see if they work again. And I just, you know,
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.940]   I think if there were a piece of technology, like, say, a fighter jet that you're giving to maybe one other
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:02.180]   country or two, that's a super deep ally. That's one thing. If you're going to sell something in 120
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:08.420]   countries around the world and try and tell one country they can't have it, there's no way that's
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:14.500]   going to work. Like, and especially these goods have digital attributes. I mean, you know, it's just,
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.460]   it's going to, it's going to work around. And, you know, I think it's going to get worse before it gets
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:27.860]   better. I have seen hints that the same people that push the H20 want to, you know, put even more
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:35.300]   restrictions on ASML, which is a Dutch company, or fine TSMC for building Huawei chips. That's a
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:41.620]   company that's headquartered in Taiwan. Right. So I'm sure Jensen's miffed that his company's become a pawn
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:48.260]   in this game. How do you think these companies, we talked about ASML in the past where the management
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:55.300]   there has already expressed some reluctance to be our, you know, whipping, whipping post or whatever.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.460]   But like, I don't know that we just are allowed to start grabbing pieces of chessboard that we don't
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:07.140]   even own and bringing them into this competition. And you said earlier that the way we implemented
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:13.620]   tariffs, we've, we've alienated many of our allies and partners. You know, I won't be surprised at all
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:18.420]   if we wake up one day and one of these companies tells us no. Right. Yeah. You know, again,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   it comes back to defining the objectives narrowly enough that you don't end up in this big retaliatory
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:34.100]   and escalatory posture. Again, I think it's a reasonably close call around H20s. My sense is
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:43.060]   that Nvidia understands and is on board with not selling leading edge chips to China, right? Like they didn't
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.660]   fight the fact that they weren't selling GB 200s to China. And the H20 is, if you just looked at the
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:54.500]   facts on the table, the Huawei Ascend 920s, the number of these that they're now producing, the
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.620]   way that they're interconnecting these things together. Yes, they may be slightly less efficient. It may
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.580]   take two or three times the number of chips and amount of power in order to end up at the exact same
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.700]   place. But we just talked about there are a hundred nuclear power plants under construction in China.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:15.140]   Power is not their limit. Well, and they produce those plants at one-fourth the price we do. So if it
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.620]   comes down to power, and many people in the AI world like to say it's going to come down to power,
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.540]   well, I guess they're going to win. Well, I mean, so there's an interesting question here. If you think
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:29.220]   about the off-ramp on these for President Trump, again, there's a lot of suggestions over the weekend
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.460]   that, you know, if you think we're going to land the plane in three to four weeks, Bill, the only way
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:39.140]   you do that is basically through unilateral concessions, right, that you define as victory.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:44.100]   So, you know, all of these countries are calling us, they want to do deals. And so we're going to walk
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:51.700]   the Chinese tariffs back to 30 or 34%. And we're going to suspend maybe for 90 days, the H20 ban in the
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:57.860]   hopes that they will reciprocate by suspending the rare earth ban or something like that. So I don't think
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.940]   we've seen the end of this when it comes to this NVIDIA ban. But, you know, the flip side of this
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:10.820]   is NVIDIA just had a big announcement, right, with the White House, about a $500 billion investment,
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:18.020]   right, in combination with a bunch of other companies, Foxconn, TSMC, etc., building fabs in
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:24.660]   the United States. I know the first GB200 is rolled off the assembly line out of those fabs in Arizona.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:32.180]   To me, again, we need to rebalance and focus on accelerating, right, and re-onshoring these
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.140]   critical industries in the United States. I think the distraction that we can keep China
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.580]   away from frontier level AI, that will be a losing strategy in my mind. I don't think we need to go
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:48.420]   out of our way to make it easy on them. But I think the obsession and the time spent and the distraction
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:54.500]   for US CEOs to try to how to how they comply with all of this, I think is not particularly great.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.860]   And I'll just give you where, you know, maybe the next frontier where this is going. I've heard,
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.980]   you know, increasing chatter that somehow we're going to try to ban DeepSeq models.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:13.220]   Right? And somehow prevent US hyperscalers or cloud companies from integrating DeepSeq models into
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.220]   their stack.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.100]   I've heard the same thing.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.140]   So talk to me about that and the slippery slope associated with that.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:25.940]   Before I go deep on DeepSeq, which I want to do, I want to mention a couple of things from a very
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.300]   broad level. You know, one is, back to this Friedman post, he mentions a quote from a book,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.940]   "How, Why, How We Do Anything Means Everything." And the quote is, "Interdependence is no longer our
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:42.900]   choice. It's our condition. Our only choice is whether we forge healthy interdependencies and
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:50.660]   rise together or maintain healthy interdependencies and fall together." And, you know, there's a book
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:57.220]   that I've been rereading that the Collison's talked about once called "Finite and Infinite Games" by James
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:04.740]   Carrs. And there's a reality that a lot of our strategy that we think about and how we compete in
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:10.340]   the world comes from finite games. A finite game is a game that has a beginning and an end and a winner.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.700]   So a football game, a basketball game, that kind of thing. Infinite games are different. They just go
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.340]   on forever. Stock market, you know, most large companies, they're infinite games. Like,
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:28.020]   there's no clock that ends. There's no one that declares a winner. I fear that a lot of the attitude,
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:36.260]   the vitriol, the language, the tone that's used between us and China is borrowed from finite game
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:43.220]   thinking. Like, that we're some, you know, win the AI war. What does that mean? Like, is there someone
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.740]   that's, is the clock going to end, like the Warriors versus the Rockets? And they say, "Oh, we won." Like,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.340]   there's no chance of that. And, and, and most of the people that are even the biggest China hawks,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:00.500]   I said, I say to them, "Do you think you're going to prohibit China's long-term AI development?" And they
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   said, "No." You know, and I, I just think we, we, there's a lot of zero-sum thinking going on. Win,
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:14.180]   lose. I totally believe in this interdependence. I, I think there's zero chance that you're going to stop
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:21.060]   China or somehow like, I even, I use the phrase, increase the gap. There's, there's a lot of
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:27.140]   arguments that the AI gap has been shrinking, not, not rising. Eric Schmidt had a big interview today
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:33.620]   where he said it was shrinking or this week. We'll put show notes on that. And a lot of people are
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.620]   saying they're catching up. That semi-analysis thing says Huawei's getting there. And so this argument that,
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:45.860]   "Oh, we've got to do everything we can. We have to act now to win the AI war." That's like almost this
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.260]   belief that we're going to increase the gap and that it's a finite game that's just going to end one
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:56.020]   day. And I don't believe in either of those things. Right, right. And so I think the tone's wrong. I think
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:02.100]   you got to get out of this enemy threat. Like all those words allow you to hate. You know, there's
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.300]   a great, great quote from the Godfather, which is, "Don't hate your enemies. It clouds your judgment." Yeah.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.820]   One of my favorite quotes ever. The whole piece of this Friedman article, which I think everyone has
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:19.460]   to read, he just went over there and spent time. It's not what you think. Like they are way ahead
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.820]   in a lot of different areas. They're super smart. They're not, you know, I think a lot of people
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.660]   thought, "Oh, we have a democracy and capitalism." And people get confused between those two. And they
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.140]   think, "We've got the perfect American exceptionalism. We're the only place where you can
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:42.260]   have innovation." And because we talk about, "Oh, they steal, they steal." We don't ever spend the time
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.820]   to go see if innovation's happening over there. It is happening over there. You know, and these people
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.660]   are educated in the same schools and universities. Like the thought that they couldn't, you know, be
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:00.500]   educated or can't innovate is going to lead you to a lot of really bad policies.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.620]   And worse yet, and worse yet, right? If you believe they're on the frontier and they're
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   going to have a frontier compute stack with frontier models, whether we help them or not, which I think
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:19.300]   even those people who are more China hawkish agree with that statement, right? And if you wanted the rest of
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:25.460]   the world to run on U.S. compute and U.S. models, what's the number one thing you would not do?
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:32.340]   You would not anger the rest of the world by launching a tariff assault on them simultaneous
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:39.460]   with your tariff assault on China. And so it is a mysterious policy. And when you look at all of
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:45.460]   these headlines that are coming out, the EU now negotiating directly with China, right? We now have
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:51.060]   Japan and South Korea and Vietnam negotiating with China. You have the Middle East, you know,
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:57.460]   entering into, you know, deals with China. I'm not sure again, that we're advancing our cause,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:03.380]   right? By making it harder on everybody else in the world and telling them they are the cause for the
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.380]   demise of the U.S. middle class.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:12.740]   Well, and I'll go even further. Like, the tone they're adopting is more statesman-like than us.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:19.700]   If you read the tone in those discussions, and they highlight that they haven't invaded anybody
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:25.860]   in a very long time. The U.S. has been involved in a lot more wars around the globe. So our ability,
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:31.460]   and I brought this up a few podcasts ago. I, you know, I think you're, you mentioned DeepSeek. So,
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:38.820]   so we all believe that there's a imminent DeepSeek ban, the level of which I don't think we fully
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:44.100]   know right now. But, you know, my immediate reaction is, oh, I guess Europe and South America will run
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:52.340]   on DeepSeek. Like, because the minute we start vilifying even that, you know, it, it is, I believe,
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:58.180]   right now, the best performing, most open, you know, if you had a quadrant, the one that's,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:04.740]   it's on the upper right on performance and openness, you know, and if we ban it, boy,
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:10.740]   it's just kind of, one, you know, even more people working with Huawei chips and DeepSeek
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:17.140]   trying to optimize it. But two, you know, in this world we've created where there's so much animosity,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.260]   I think people would be glad to use it in these other countries.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.820]   Well, the first thing it dawns on me is I ultimately don't think, you know, somebody
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.780]   asked me on CNBC, you know, they, I said, your decision as to whether be in the market
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:35.620]   comes down to whether you think the president is more, you know, kind of tactical free trader in
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:41.540]   the spirit of the Besant consensus, fully loaded gun, rarely discharged, or whether you really think
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:48.180]   he wants to reorient the world in the way Navarro discusses it. I still believe the president is
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.940]   fundamentally a free trader, that this really is about making the US more resilient. And he has to,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:58.900]   he has to bring us back there, right? Because if we, if we head in the direction of Navarro,
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:05.540]   it's quite clear to me that we're going to so anger the rest of the world, that the chance that the rest of
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.660]   the world is going to run on US compute. I think, I think what we do in that instance is you move
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:16.660]   everybody in the direction of China, it backfires. We don't widen the gap with China with respect to AI
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.140]   or global trade or anything else. In fact, we, we shrink the gap.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.580]   By the way, by the way, there's one, I think, hilarious irony with the, with the Navarro point of
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:34.340]   view and combined with the, with, with the export control, which is, if we're gonna, if we're upset
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.700]   that there is this trade imbalance, you know, the worst thing, the last thing you'd want to do is start
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:45.460]   penalizing our best creators, our best manufacturers, our best companies. Right.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.660]   How are you going to solve the trade imbalance if we tell people they can't buy our best stuff? Right.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:56.020]   We're going to make them buy our stuff. Which is just an example. I, I, I think, I think Nvidia sold,
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:02.820]   you know, 12 or $15 billion worth of H20s. So if you ban those, then your trade deficit with China
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.300]   goes up by $15 billion. That's my point. That's my very point. And let's not, let's not wash over the,
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:13.380]   I think Nvidia is such a high performance companies worth so much money, such a large market cap,
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:19.700]   so much cash, no liquidity issues that this $5 billion write-off they're going to take is kind
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:25.700]   of NBD move on. You know, it didn't affect stock that much, but a $5 billion write-off, they're just
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.180]   going to throw a bunch of inventory in the trash can. Well, I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:35.300]   remarkable. Think about that, Bill. Right. Some of the people who are arguing, right. Including some
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:42.100]   USAI companies that they shouldn't be able to sell the H20s to China. Right. If Jensen or the team at
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.580]   Nvidia turned around and said, great, you buy them. Nobody would buy them because they're so
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:53.780]   underperforming. Right. And yet it makes the point for them. But think about this 15 billion in sales
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:45:00.900]   of H20s. Right. That probably results in, you know, eight, $9 billion of, of earnings, you know,
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:06.740]   back to Nvidia. You tax that at a corporate rate, that's two or $3 billion to the U S treasury. Right.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:14.260]   We are effectively taxing the Chinese on a nerfed product to provide profits to Nvidia to further
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.620]   distance the lead, uh, you know, against Huawei and to put money in the U S treasury. And we just
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.260]   unilaterally disarmed around that in a way that doesn't even advantage us against Huawei because
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:30.020]   their chips are already surpassing the H20. And that leaves out, and I agree with a hundred percent of
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:37.460]   that. And there's even more because of escalation. So, so, you know, it's, I, I, once again, I go back
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:46.100]   to this finite game mindset. I, I think people are evaluating a decision on an expert, export control,
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:54.260]   or a tariff or a ban, um, without totally in isolation as that one decision. And what will
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:46:00.420]   its impact be? But any one of these decisions and certainly the combination of them could lead to
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:08.660]   escalation that could go as far as leading to a hot war. And so you have to accept responsibility
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:15.860]   of making any one of these decisions that there are, you know, butterfly effects and escalatory effects
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:21.700]   that you may wade into. Right. By doing that. Right. I mean, you can think about it this way.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:28.980]   We define, some people define artificial intelligence as existential, right? Like that is absolutely
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:35.620]   essential to your national security. It's essential to your national economic security. Now, if you are
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:41.220]   firing a shot at somebody that says, I'm going to deprive you of being able to build your national
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.900]   security or your national economic security, right? Like it's, it's a serious, it's a serious thing.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:53.700]   I, um, I, I want to go on record as saying like almost everyone in the AI space that I see with a
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:47:00.260]   microphone in front of them says the U.S. has to win the AI war. Yeah. I don't know what that means.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.340]   Yeah. And if, if I guess as to what it means, I don't think it's possible. Right.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:10.180]   And so. Because it's an infinite game. It's an infinite game and no one that I talked to would
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:16.580]   argue we're going to somehow prohibit them from moving forward in AI. Let's not forget it wasn't
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:23.700]   that long ago that open AI, they'll say borrowed or copied the innovation that happened at Google and
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:30.100]   DeepSeek. Like this is how innovation works. Ideas spread like the wind. They move fast. People study what
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:36.820]   other people do. It happens all the time. And when only when we apply these labels of theft or copy or
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:42.180]   steal, do we start vilifying, but, but it happens all the time in our own ecosystem. Right. Right.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:48.740]   It's how these things evolve. And so, yeah, I don't, I don't think there's a finite game to win. You know,
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:53.940]   it's funny. I was, I did some research on something because I was very curious. I went back and studied,
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:48:00.340]   and it's so easy with AI, I went back and studied the space race. And when, when the space race was
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:07.060]   underway, if you go back and look at the quotes from all the senators and, and President JFK and
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.420]   everything, one of the reasons, maybe the primary reason they said, we got to win the space race,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:22.180]   is they all believed that the entire globe would be covered in this mesh of rockets and satellites that
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:29.860]   would be used to control the military of the globe. And whoever got to space first was going to have this
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:37.380]   control. Now that never played out, but I see a very similar vein in AI where people, especially
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:43.380]   people that believe in AGI and ASI and magical AI think that it's just going to explode. And then
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:51.940]   whoever controls this uncontrollable force will control the globe in a zero sum way. And I, I, I just,
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.500]   I don't buy it. Like, I don't think that's going to happen. If that does happen, we're going to have
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.660]   a much bigger problem. I think you and I would maybe find a point of agreement here.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:06.420]   Like what is the North star that should guide us? And I think the, the point of agreement,
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:12.820]   if we were giving advice would be that the re-onshoring of critical national industries
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:20.660]   through, you know, some tactical means is an important objective. Okay. But I, I think you and
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:27.540]   I would also agree that we need to shift the focus radically on accelerating our own race,
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:33.780]   right. And, and refocus from spending all of our time trying to slow down everybody else.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:40.260]   And the objective should be the KPI should be, do we widen the gap, right? Do American companies,
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.540]   are they as successful in AI as they were in the internet? Like, I think anybody who looks back at
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:53.220]   the last 20 years would say that the United States has won both in terms of, of, of free trade and in
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:50:00.660]   terms of the global internet competition, one as defined by improved the standard of living,
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.700]   driven the growth, the, the, the economy in the United States, uh, in a way that was successful
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:11.220]   for the United States. You know, I, I, in one argument with someone, I used the, the simple
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:18.740]   metaphor that comes from swimming, any, anyone that becomes a competitive swimmer within a year or two,
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:23.860]   you know, a coach tells them don't look to the side, you know, cause that's wasted energy and
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:29.300]   someone might pass you just swim as fast as you can. Just look ahead. And I feel like, you know,
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:35.380]   it's, it's almost worse than just looking to the side. We're trying to intentionally inhibit the other,
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.340]   other player now going back to fight since, since I'm trying to deflate the football.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:47.300]   Yeah. Yeah. It's exactly. Imagine if you were just watching a finite game and one team insisted
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:53.060]   that the other team have a technical disadvantage, what would your reaction be? How would you think
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:51:00.500]   about that player? Right. You, you would probably assume they're scared that they're unsure of themselves.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.780]   Right. Like, like, well, and also if you told your team at the start of the season, don't worry,
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.260]   you don't have to train very hard because I've handicapped the other team. They don't even know
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:15.460]   what I've done to them, but I've, you know, I've tainted their system. So they're not going to be very
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.140]   good as opposed to just focusing on your own training and winning the game.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:24.100]   But I might, I might, I might end by going back to, uh, you know, this argument from the Friedman
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:32.020]   police that, that it's an interconnected world. And there are a lot of very smart, successful,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:39.700]   capable, innovative engineers, researchers, founders in China. And if you think you're going to like,
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:47.140]   keep them down or permanently, you know, prohibit them from playing in AI, I think that mindset is
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.140]   going to lead to some spectacularly problematic policy.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:57.860]   Yeah, I agree. Well, maybe talk about, we can wrap Tesla reported tonight. Um, and,
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:04.900]   and the markets are clearly struggling down one day, 4% up the next day, 4% clearly struggling,
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:10.420]   trying to get their hands around, uh, you know, where we are. So since we were here last time,
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:17.300]   you know, the S and P's down 10% NASDAQ, I think as of yesterday was down 20% peak to trough.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.860]   And the question people ask me all the time, is this all priced in? How many units of risk
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:27.540]   do you have in the market? We have Besant doing a talk tomorrow morning on the financial system.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:33.860]   The VIX is still over 30. There are fears and rumors out there about is our 10 year, you know,
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:39.780]   do we have demand for it on a global basis? The dollar is under assault here. So-
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.380]   And many of these conversations weren't happening five months ago.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.020]   Right. Exactly.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.260]   We were just talking about AI and Nvidia and-
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:53.300]   I mean, I go back to this Stan Druckenmiller quote, where, you know, after the, you know,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.780]   the president's election, he said, this is the most, this is the biggest shift from an anti-business
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.500]   administration to a pro-business administration in my 50 years of being in the business, right?
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:09.780]   That is how CEOs generally felt at the beginning of January, moving in, uh, to this new presidency.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.420]   And it's really mind boggling to think in nine, you know, in a few short weeks,
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:20.260]   how quickly we went from that level of optimism to this level of concern. And I was just looking at a
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:28.820]   chart, you know, Apple's down 21%, Nvidia's down 25%, Google's down 20%, Tesla's down 40%, right? We have
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.580]   major moves in the market.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:35.780]   Well, and look, I mean, in both Tesla and Apple have a huge amount of revenue in China.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:35.860]   Right.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:42.980]   And when you sense that this thing may be escalating or that there are ripple effects going back and
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:48.020]   forth, what one, one plausible thing that could happen is either one of them get kicked out of
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:48.580]   the country.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.300]   Right, right.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.180]   That could happen.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:50.580]   Yes.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.980]   And so, of course, you have to discount this stuff.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.940]   Of course, of course.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:54:00.420]   And the question now, of course, is, is enough discounted given where we are? And so, you know,
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.500]   I said at the end of January, early February, when you and I did the pot, I said, we've taken
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.980]   down our units of risk because there's just more uncertainty in the world. Discount rates need to
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:13.620]   come up. Multiples are coming down. And we did. And I would say over the course of the past several
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:19.140]   weeks, we've had very little risk on directional risk along the market. You can like Nvidia,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:23.620]   but if you wake up one morning and 12 billion of their sales are gone because they can no longer
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:29.060]   sell, you know, chips in China, that's something again, that, that is the macro that is hard for
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:29.700]   you to forecast.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.940]   You know, going to Nvidia, I've heard rumors that they, that they want that the government,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:39.540]   US government, US government, and I, but not to sound like a victory lap, but I said a few episodes
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:45.860]   ago, the biggest risk on Nvidia was the government and that turned out to be true here. And they may
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.980]   not be done. I've heard arguments that they want to do
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.260]   a customer audit. I don't know what that is or involves.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:57.380]   Well, they were suggesting it last week. I think even on, uh, even, even on our, our, our friends
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.900]   pod where, you know, maybe you should look into all these shipments or all these sales that are,
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:08.100]   that are, that are going to Singapore or whatever. And again, I, I welcome all, all of that. Like,
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:13.540]   I think all companies should have to comply with us rules and regulations. I suspect that they do.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.780]   But again, if I just step back here, gold's outperforming, uh, the S and P so far this year
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:25.140]   by about 40%, right? What does that tell you? People are moving into safe havens. They don't
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:29.460]   know where this is all going to land. Here's one of the things that really concerns me, Bill.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:36.420]   If we look at consensus earnings expectations for the S and P so far this year, we started the year,
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:44.660]   we expected 15% growth. We expected the S and P to do $273 a share. Now the consensus is 12%
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:51.780]   growth. So $265 a share. So consensus earnings expectations for the S and P have barely moved
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:58.420]   down. And when I think about the chaos of the last eight weeks, every CEO that I talked to says,
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:02.900]   we're on hold, we're tightening our belts, we're taking a more cautious approach to the year. We
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.900]   can't make decisions. We don't know where tariffs are going to be. We don't know where this is going
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:12.820]   to be. It's hard for me to think that you can literally wipe two months out of the year in terms
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:19.380]   of, you know, where, uh, decision-making is going on in these companies and only have a 3% adjustment,
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.420]   uh, to S and P earnings. Now, what are we seeing this, uh, over the course of the last two weeks? Well,
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:30.340]   Scott Kirby from United airlines comes out. He gives two different guides and he says, you know,
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.980]   if there's a recession, which we may have, you know, then earnings are going to be seven to eight
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:39.140]   bucks. And if there's not a recession, earnings will be 12 bucks. So you have companies that are
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.220]   doing highly unusual things in terms of saying, we don't know that we don't know the future.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:47.540]   So we're either not going to give you a guide at all, or we're going to give you this wide dispersion
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:54.420]   and a guide. So I think for most managers, people are looking at this, they're at max caution. I think
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:59.060]   from an altimeter perspective, we were pretty cautious. And now we're looking at again, leaning
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:05.380]   back into markets on some of these down days where it's big risk off, because I think ultimately the
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:11.300]   president is going to make deals. You know, Besant is going to get deals done. I think we're going to
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:16.980]   probably land somewhere in this kind of five to 10% tariffs for the rest of the world, right? If you add
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:22.020]   that up, that's going to be somewhere order of magnitude $200 billion of tariffs. And you're not
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:27.460]   going to end up at 140 on China, we're probably going to get rid of these export bans and embargoes
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:34.820]   and land the plane somewhere around 25 or 30%. Now, mind you, that's still a three to four X increase
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:39.780]   over the tariffs from last year. But I think what the world needs is predictability, and they need it
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:44.820]   soon. I think if we're still having this conversation in eight, 12, 16 weeks,
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:50.100]   with this level of uncertainty around tariffs, I think it's going to have a much bigger headwind
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:55.540]   to those S&P earnings for the year. And as those earnings come down, we know that the market's going
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:00.980]   to have to come down with it. So the S&P as of end of the day today is only down about 10% for the year.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:05.140]   And if you think about all the things that have changed, that feels to me like just the air coming
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:10.420]   out of the balloon in terms of like the certainty and the uncertainty that we have in the market,
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.220]   I think the next move down, if we have it, is going to be around growth. And we really haven't
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:20.660]   got a lot of growth earnings. Tesla's out tonight. And even though earnings came in a lot lower than
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:26.100]   expected, I think people are looking through that as kind of one time. But by the time we get another
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:33.860]   month or two into the next earnings season, if we continue to see this level of uncertainty and drifting
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.580]   down, I think we're going to have problems and further problems in the market.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:45.540]   I admire your hopeful optimism and the data points that I see in the past 24 hours about how soon
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:52.740]   something might come together. I think there was an announcement that India, we had finalized the
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:57.940]   terms of reference. I don't know what that means, but it doesn't sound like you're very close to being
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:02.660]   done. Right. That was J.D. Vance today in meetings with Modi, came out of the meetings,
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:10.100]   said we had a big breakthrough. We came to terms of reference on what the trade deal will be,
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.820]   but it will still take months in order to hammer out the deal.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.660]   Right. So months, I think months is too long.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:20.420]   I think the, you know, the reflexivity already starts to take place, everything you just described.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:27.540]   And once it does, some of it is certainly self-reinforcing. So you start decommitting
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:36.340]   CapEx, you start decommitting, you know, basic capacity on different manufacturing lines, planes,
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:41.860]   whatever, and it will become self-reinforcing. You raise prices when you decommit because you have
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:48.340]   less land, like that's inflationary. Everything starts, the fear of it starts to become the reality.
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:55.380]   Right. I guess, you know, a thought experiment. If I described everything to you that has happened
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:01.780]   thus far this year, and I asked you, should the market be higher or lower from the all-time highs
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:07.460]   where we started the year? You would say, of course, it should be lower. Right. And I don't think that
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:15.460]   down 10% on the S&P sounds to me like irrational, given the level of uncertainty that we've injected in a
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:21.780]   very short period of time. And so to me, if you're, you know, if you're thinking about units of risk,
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.900]   you know, it still feels to me like you're in that bottom third, right? Of whatever your normal
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   exposures are, you're in kind of that bottom third, you know, everybody wants to buy the dip and go all
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:38.500]   in. And, you know, I think we need a lot more certainty as to where this is going. I do think that
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.820]   it would be very helpful. And it sounds like the president is starting to make some of these comments
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:50.260]   just this afternoon to disavow ourselves of this, you know, Navarro style, replace the internal revenue
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:56.540]   service. If we can just get a four-year forecast that it's about re-onshoring a few industries,
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.740]   land the plane on China or on Japan and India, and then on China, I think that gives us what we need to
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.600]   plan, you know, but there are a lot of other things that have to come together in order to keep the
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:14.120]   market moving forward. So, you know, we didn't even get to talk about the impact this is going to have
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.300]   on startups and on, you know, what we're seeing in kind of the startup ecosystem. We'll come back and do
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:27.520]   that next time. But I think that, listen, I'm kind of tired of talking about tariffs, but it is the most
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.800]   important thing and it is impacting everything that we're looking at, both on the public and on the
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.920]   venture side of the business today. So, you know, it's unavoidable. We have this really important
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.200]   divergence, I think, in terms of points of view. And what's interesting to me is kind of the free trade
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.220]   side of this argument has largely been drowned out. And, you know, so I appreciate you steel manning that
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:58.900]   side of it. I mean, look, I assume most people that have at least had a finance class have studied
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:06.320]   comparative advantage, but it's very mathematical. Like, it's very deterministic. Like, doing stuff
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.880]   you're good at and letting other people do stuff they're good at is a win-win-win-win-win. And you
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.900]   start backing that up and you're going to get lose-lose-lose. I'm certain of it.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.600]   Yeah. Here, here. Here, here. Let's land the plane and get back to building America.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.840]   Okay. Take care, man.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:36.180]   As a reminder to everybody, just our opinions, not investment advice.
