[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.760]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.360]   Today, our asset protection planning series comes back from vacation.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.520]   It's been hiding out down in the sunny climes of the Caribbean, sitting on the beach, laying
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600]   low, waiting for all of the storms and investigations to pass.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   But now, it's time to come back and get back to work.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.400]   So we begin today with part eight, called Annuity Values and Annuity Payments, Exemption
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   Planning.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320]   So for context, we're talking here about asset protection planning for mere mortals.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   And my goal in this show is to give you a lot of low-hanging fruit, some exposure to
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.660]   a number of strategies that are available to mortals.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.640]   Not to somebody with $10 million, but to any person who's just simply building assets,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.000]   accumulating capital, and thinking about how to protect that capital from the unique risks
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   that you face.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.540]   And so I'm trying to make everything very accessible.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.200]   And annuities are an important component of that.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.400]   We've been talking about exemption planning for the last few shows.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   And of course, exemption planning involves assets that are specifically exempt from the
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.040]   claims of creditors based upon US federal or state law.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960]   Apologies to my international listeners, but some of these concepts will come over.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.760]   But you'll have to, of course, do the detailed research for your country, as well as listeners
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.760]   in each state.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.600]   You have to research your own particular state.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020]   But we've talked about retirement account exemptions.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.200]   We've talked about life insurance exemptions.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   We've talked about homestead exemptions.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.080]   And today we continue with annuity exemptions.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.240]   Now annuities are interesting creatures.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.720]   I really love annuities.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   Not everybody does.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280]   I always chuckle.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.440]   Clark Howard, a well-known financial broadcaster, just done a great job.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.080]   I really enjoy his work.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.240]   But Clark Howard calls annuities a four-letter word in his show.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.640]   And I always chuckle when he says that.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.840]   Because in a way, he's not wrong, but he's certainly not right.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.800]   He's right about that statement in the same way that I'm right in making a statement like
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   this.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.520]   A dog is a totally worthless creature.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080]   I repeat, a dog is a totally worthless creature.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   Now is your dog worthless?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   Well, of course, that depends a lot on the context.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.040]   A dog really is worthless.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.440]   Of course, if you went out and tried to sell your dog, you really wouldn't be able to sell
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   your dog.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   So of course, it's worthless.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.560]   Except that you say, but that's not why I have the dog.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.200]   I really love my dog.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.480]   I like a lot of the things that I get from my dog.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   I get love.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   I get affection.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.040]   I get plenty of licks around the head and shoulders.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.280]   And so I like my dog.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   My dog is not worthless.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.200]   It's an important part of my life.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.760]   Well, your dog isn't worthless, but yet it still is worthless.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   Except, you know, some dogs actually can be sold.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.200]   So they're not worthless.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.000]   But even if you have an expensive dog that's not worthless, because you could actually
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   sell it for money, the owner might still call it worthless, because it's just not doing
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040]   its job well.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.720]   So for example, you go out, buy an expensive guard dog, pay a lot of money for the training.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.440]   You could sell it for a lot of money.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.940]   Guard dogs are not cheap.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.320]   But the guard dog prefers to cuddle up by the fireplace and is not too interested in
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.120]   ripping out an intruder's throat when you give it its attack commands.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.680]   So that worthless dog sits around for years and you just say, man, that worthless dog,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   I spent $15,000 on that thing and it is totally worthless.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   Until one day that dog jumps out of its bed and saves your daughter's life by protecting
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960]   her from a kidnapping attempt.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.720]   Now, of course, it was bleary eyed and stumbling around from a little too much sleep by the
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.840]   fire, but it still came through in time of need.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.400]   So your worthless dog turned out to be worth something after all to you.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.440]   But because it won't attack on command, you can't sell it anymore because no one wants
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.400]   to pay top dollar for a bleary eyed guard dog that sits by the fire all day.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.520]   So it's worthless after all.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.960]   Now, it's maddening, isn't it?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.380]   A statement like that, dogs are worthless, is a maddening statement because there's so
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.960]   many different directions that you could go with it.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.520]   I've just scratched the surface on all the permutations that I came up with on that particular
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.320]   statement I made up.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.800]   So let's save our dissertation on the relative worthlessness of dogs for another day.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   I just want you to think of that statement in the same way that you think of the statement
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.920]   annuities are a four letter word.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.040]   It's expressing a truth.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.400]   A statement like that is expressing a truth that's important for you to understand, but
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.160]   it's not a true statement.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.760]   It's obviously not objectively explicitly true because annuities has 11 letters in it.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.920]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine letters, not four letters.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   So it's obviously not true.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   And it's not true that they're a four letter word in the metaphorical sense, but yet it
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.400]   is.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.000]   And this is the problem with annuities.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.880]   So let's start back to the beginning to add a little context so that you can figure out
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.260]   whether your annuities might be worthless or extremely valuable.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.260]   What is an annuity?
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.680]   Well, you can think about an annuity in multiple ways.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   You can think about an annuity in terms of a pot of money and or a stream of payments.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.340]   Usually when talking about annuities, we define an annuity as a stream of payments, a stream
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.580]   of payments that comes into somebody and it often comes in for something approaching life
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.320]   expectancy.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.080]   In many ways, we talk about annuities as the opposite of life insurance.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.060]   When you buy a life insurance policy, you make premium payments into that policy until
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.560]   the moment of death and then when the death claim is filed, that life insurance policy
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.840]   pays out a large lump sum of money to the stated beneficiary.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   So that's life insurance.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.960]   Now annuity is the opposite because you can take a large sum of money and you can give
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.120]   it to an insurance company and they can make out a series of payments that come in each
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   month until the moment of death at which time the payments stop.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.280]   So one useful way of thinking about annuities is as a way of disposing of a large amount
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.900]   of money over the course of somebody's lifetime.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.420]   But of course there are many types of annuities.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.520]   There are immediate annuities and there are deferred annuities.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.200]   There are annuities that come in for a fixed term.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.580]   There are annuities that come in for a lifetime.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.480]   There are annuities that come in for a lifetime and or a fixed term.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.040]   There are annuities that come in for, that are calculated based upon fixed interest rates
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.740]   that are guaranteed by an insurance company.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.480]   There are annuities that are based upon variable rates.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.160]   And I don't want to go into a whole discourse on all the different types of product versions,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.600]   but I want you to think about this in terms of concept.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.240]   So back to corpus or stream of payments.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.560]   With specific regard to asset protection planning, annuities that are a sum of money are valuable
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.640]   and also annuities that are a stream of payments can be valuable.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.980]   Both of these can be valuable.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.680]   You can take a million dollars and you can go to the commercial annuity marketplace and
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.000]   you can say to a commercial insurance company, here is a million dollars.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.480]   You can deposit that million dollars into an annuity contract.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.840]   It's an insurance contract.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   You can deposit the million dollars into the annuity contract.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.480]   That annuity contract can sit there and then five years, 10 years from now, you can go
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.920]   back to that contract and you can take out your million dollars plus interest and do
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.180]   whatever you want with it and yet have it inside that annuity contract.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.520]   That is one way of thinking about an annuity.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   I think of that as the corpus, the body of money that's just sitting there.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.520]   And sometimes you don't have to decide in advance what happens with the money.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.980]   You can just simply put the money into an annuity contract.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.480]   Now on the flip side, you can think about an annuity in terms of a series of payments,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.840]   a stream of payments.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.640]   You can take that same million dollars to an insurance company.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.320]   You can say, here insurance company, make payments to me for the rest of my life.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.720]   And they'll say, okay, well based upon your life expectancy, we'll make payments to you
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.120]   of $800 every month for the rest of your life.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.740]   That's also an annuity.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.040]   But in that case, once you have that series of payments, you no longer have access to
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.400]   the million dollars.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.040]   You have now the series of payments.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.120]   It's important to point out, however, that both of these are valuable.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.400]   It's valuable to have a body of money, a corpus of money.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.880]   It's also valuable to have a stream of payments.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.480]   Now when you think about your net worth, you usually think in terms of the body of money.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.400]   And so you usually think in terms of that value, that corpus of money.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.000]   But is that really the most important thing?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   Or are annuity payments more important?
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Ask a question.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   Who's richer?
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.400]   A 30 year old with a million dollars in the bank and no income, or a 30 year old with
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.440]   no assets, but a guaranteed $100,000 a year income for the rest of his life?
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.040]   Which 30 year old is richer?
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.680]   I repeat, a 30 year old with a million dollars in the bank and no income, or a 30 year old
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.160]   with no assets, no money in the bank, but a guaranteed income of $100,000 a year for
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   the rest of his life?
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.160]   Which is richer?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.520]   I should probably adjust those numbers a little bit because a 30 year old couldn't buy a million
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.160]   dollar with a million dollars, couldn't buy $100,000 a year.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.080]   So let's just say it's $60,000 a year.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   Which is richer?
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   You get the point.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.840]   The point is that you can't answer the question because sometimes the body of money is valuable
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.000]   and sometimes the stream of income is valuable.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.440]   Now here's why that's so important.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   When we come to asset protection planning, both of these strategies can be appropriate
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.120]   ways of protecting money.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   For example, if you have a million dollars in a bank account and you move that million
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.800]   dollars into an annuity contract, and if annuity contracts are exempt from the claims of creditors
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:04.280]   in your particular state, you have effectively protected the million dollars.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.220]   And that can be very helpful in your overall asset protection scheme.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.800]   Sometimes however, you can't do that.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   But you can take a million dollars out of your bank account and you can purchase a stream
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.000]   of payments that comes in for the rest of your life.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   And those payments can either be legally protected from the claims of creditors or simply functionally
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.860]   protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.280]   If you're trying to convert a non-protected asset into a protected asset, you can do that
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.560]   with an annuity.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.200]   If you're facing problems, you can take a million dollars from your bank account.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.960]   You can go to a commercial insurance company and you can say, "Here's a million dollars.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.880]   I want you to pay me a stream of annuity payments beginning 20 years from now."
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.720]   You can make that an irrevocable contract where they'll start 20 years from now.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.520]   Well now practically, what is a creditor going to come after?
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.920]   Are they going to sit around and wait for 20 years for this stream of payments that
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.560]   they can then legally come after?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.840]   That would be a very rare creditor indeed.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.960]   And so annuities can be very useful in many ways in asset protection planning.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   You have to study the laws of your state.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.320]   You have to look at the laws of the specific situation.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.920]   This is very detailed planning where specific legal knowledge needs to be applied.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.520]   But conceptually, annuities can provide for a lot of benefits.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.600]   Why did I go into so much about the corpus and the payments?
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.400]   Well some states protect the corpus.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.980]   Some states protect the stream of payments.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.600]   So we'll talk more about that in just a moment.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.360]   Now here are a couple of points.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.000]   You already own an annuity.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.360]   You're already contributing to an annuity if you are a US person.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.540]   That annuity is called Social Security.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.120]   Now Social Security is a unique asset because it is exempt from the claims of creditors
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.160]   when you receive the income.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.760]   It's also exempt from bankruptcy court.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.640]   Any listener of the show for two or three episodes would know I'm not a fan of the
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.800]   Social Security program for many reasons.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.300]   But it can be a useful form of asset protection.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.200]   One thing that might hopefully make you feel a little bit better about throwing all your
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.560]   money into the Social Security program is that at the very least, those payments that
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   you're making are going to be protected from the claims of your creditors.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.160]   If you're making a contribution each month through your payroll deferrals or your self-employment
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.800]   taxes that you're contributing, if you're making a contribution to the Social Security
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.120]   administration, and then in retirement you take that in distribution out, those income
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.520]   streams, the assets that you are accumulating in the Social Security system are protected
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.960]   from the claims of creditors.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.840]   There are other kinds of annuities that also function like this.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.740]   So for example, you might be enrolled in a defined benefit pension program, some system
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.280]   where when you retire you receive a certain amount of money.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.920]   You receive a retirement stream for the rest of your life of a specific amount, a specific
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.760]   dollar amount or a specific dollar amount that's calculated based upon a formula.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.780]   That asset is protected from the claims of creditors, primarily because it's a retirement
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:37.200]   program and it falls in under those retirement exemptions, but functionally it's an annuity.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.040]   That's what it is.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.760]   So you could have a 401k account, which is a sum of money that is protected from the
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.720]   claims of creditors, but what we're talking about is a stream of payments in the form
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.940]   of a pension program that is protected from creditors.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.360]   Now annuities have their exceptions.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.700]   For example, commercial annuities are not protected against the IRS making a charge
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.700]   against you.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.580]   They're not protected from criminal judgments, just like most of those other assets.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.820]   So if you're up against the IRS, your million dollar commercial annuity is not going to
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:17.020]   protect you, but they are protected from many different, more everyday creditors.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.120]   They are protected.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.080]   Or I should modify that to say they often are protected.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.140]   You need to check on the specific rules of your states.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.580]   I'm going to give a couple of state examples in a moment.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.580]   I could go over so many states, but it just would be maddening to go through the 50 United
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.420]   States and talk about what's protected and what's not protected.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.900]   And there is a wide range.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.540]   Florida, of course, being where I have the most familiarity of having done financial
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:47.260]   planning on the ground, Florida protects annuity values the same as life insurance cash values,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.360]   which means that Florida protects 100% of the value of annuities.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.140]   That's protected 100%.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.160]   So if you had a lot of money in Florida, you have lots of tools available to you.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.340]   You can buy a house that is protected from homestead exemptions.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.880]   You can purchase life insurance and accumulate cash values.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.300]   You can put your money inside of annuity contract.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.900]   You can fund your IRAs.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.500]   And then we'll talk in the next episode on college exemptions.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.380]   You can fund things like five to nine accounts, and those will all be protected from the claims
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   or creditors.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.520]   Now, there are other interesting states, states where things are not protected at all.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.880]   For example, if we go to the state of Massachusetts, Massachusetts doesn't protect annuity cash
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.840]   values, and it does not protect annuity payments.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.000]   So Massachusetts, annuities would not be useful to you.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.760]   Now, there are some states which are a mixture of these things.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.040]   For example, some states protect the values, and some states protect a monthly payment.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.320]   We went to Delaware, Massachusetts' neighbor.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:58.340]   $350 per month in annuity payments is protected, plus an amount needed for reasonable requirements
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.120]   of the debtor and dependents.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.380]   That's different than a huge amount, and many states have a specific stated sum.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.960]   We could go throughout all the states.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.300]   Now, there are some states which are interesting in the difference between annuities and life
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.600]   insurance or annuities and IRAs.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.980]   For example, the state of Georgia does not protect life insurance cash values beyond
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.240]   about $2,000 from the claims or creditors.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.160]   But in the state of Georgia, annuities are protected, based upon my understanding of
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   the state law.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.400]   Consult with an attorney in the state of Georgia who would be an expert on that.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.440]   So you can look at your state and try to figure out how to put these tools together.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.240]   So let me give you just some basic planning ideas.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:45.960]   In annuities, think about protecting a sum of money just through simple exemption planning.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:53.760]   If your state, the laws of your state, protect annuity values from the claims or creditors,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.840]   consider purchasing an annuity to shelter the money that would otherwise be exposed
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.440]   to the claims or creditors.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.000]   Now, if you do this, you will have to consider a few things.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.520]   First, you'll have to consider the investments that will be represented by the annuity.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.960]   You'll also have to consider the costs that will be incurred by the annuity.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.480]   Let's start with investments.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.720]   Functionally, annuities fall into two different categories, what are called fixed annuities
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.920]   and what are called variable annuities.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:29.060]   A fixed annuity is like a contract, is a contract with an insurance company, like you can sometimes
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.700]   purchase an investment contract with a bank.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.300]   In a fixed annuity, an insurance company guarantees a stated rate of return on the money.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.180]   They guarantee that return and it's backed up by the full faith and credit of the insurance
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.180]   company.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.080]   Think of this like a CD from a bank.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.920]   If you purchase the annuity, you'll get this particular interest rate.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.800]   Now those interest rates will vary depending on the interest rate environment.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.000]   In a low interest rate environment, they will of course be fairly low, but they do have
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.680]   a high degree of safety, of certainty.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.320]   Yes, you're going to get a low return compared to a riskier investment, but you're going
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.940]   to get certainty.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.960]   And that may be useful for you, especially if you were entering into a period of time
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.760]   at which you thought you might need to make sure that a certain amount of money is protected.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.560]   We will deal very lightly in this show with the Fraudulent Transfers Act.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   Annuities are interesting in that they are generally not a transfer without value, but
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.920]   as in anything, the best time to do asset protection planning is before you need it,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.480]   before a claim arises.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.000]   What I mean when I say before thinking about something like this, let's say that you had
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.600]   a good amount of money and you were getting ready to start a business enterprise that
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.760]   might expose you to a higher amount of liability, or you were getting ready to make some particular
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.200]   move in your personal life that might expose you to some kind of liability.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   Well, it might be wise for you to look and say, "Where can I stash the money?"
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.560]   So that if some circumstances that give rise to a claim occur two or three years from now,
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.520]   I would be protected and my money would be protected.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   Annuities can do that.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.280]   And you can purchase an annuity contract, a fixed annuity contract, and it's functionally
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.360]   similar to purchasing a CD.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.640]   You can purchase the contract, you can keep the annuity for 10 years, 5 years, whatever,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.720]   and you'll get a fixed rate of return on that contract.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.360]   Now the difference between a fixed contract and a variable contract has to do with the
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   investment.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.560]   In a fixed contract, the insurance company will be taking your money and investing that
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.960]   with their general portfolio of investments, paying you your interest rate based upon their
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.360]   earnings from that portfolio, and they're guaranteeing it.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.900]   Different annuity contracts might have some flexibility.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.600]   For example, you might buy a fixed contract, which has a certain rate that's guaranteed
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.200]   for a certain time, but that rate can adjust.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.600]   There are all kinds of options available.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.360]   Now that's different than a variable contract.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.960]   A variable contract works like a variable life insurance policy where you're purchasing
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.400]   what are called subaccounts in the language of insurance companies.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.840]   A subaccount is functionally a separate investment account.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.960]   Usually it's just simply a mutual fund.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.920]   Usually it's a mainstream mutual fund that has been slightly reorganized to be a subaccount
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.200]   for an annuity portfolio, and you're purchasing credits in that subaccount.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.960]   What that means is you can go and you can purchase your mutual fund that's invested
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.440]   in the stock market, and your annuity in that case will receive the same rate of return
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.000]   that the mutual fund holders own.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.200]   So you'll be exposed to the potential for profit from the market, or you'll also be
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.560]   exposed to the potential of loss of value due to declines in the market.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.500]   So you can purchase a variable annuity and be exposed to market risk with a potential
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.500]   for market upside.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.880]   Now at the very high end, if you have enough money, you can purchase a private annuity,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.680]   an annuity issued by a commercial insurance company where even your account is individually
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   managed.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.880]   So it is possible, if you have enough money, to have an investment manager individually
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.200]   managing your personal $5 million portfolio, but that's being managed inside of an annuity
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.960]   contract.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.040]   Pretty high end, it's possible.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.200]   We talked about fixed versus variable annuities.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:20.640]   You could see how, if you're trying to invest money, an annuity can bring you useful protection
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.020]   because of the creditor protection.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:31.120]   If you're going to own mutual funds that are just simply open-end mutual funds, you can
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:38.560]   just simply probably own those same mutual funds inside of an annuity.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:46.640]   And you move those mutual funds from an unprotected class to a protected class.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.280]   So in your investment options, think carefully.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.760]   And if you want to own something with those investment characteristics, look at annuity
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.120]   contracts, shop the market, see what's available.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.520]   Now the other thing that you want to ask questions about is what about the expenses in an annuity?
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.800]   Because any investment will feature some expenses.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.280]   Your very cheapest way for you to invest in something like a company is for you to go
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.560]   to the company, purchase shares of stock directly, and hold those shares of stock yourself with
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.400]   individual registration with that company.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.200]   You'll have no investment management fees, you'll get the full dividend, you'll have
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.680]   the cheapest option.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.120]   But any layer of investment management that you put on top of that is going to feature
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.880]   some amount of expense.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.040]   Those expenses range from very small, for example if you're purchasing index funds from
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.960]   the large low-cost providers, they'll allow you to hold large numbers of investments at
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.000]   a very low expense, to very high.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.040]   If you're paying an individual investment advisor a percentage of money to manage and
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.000]   purchase individual stocks in your portfolio, then your expenses are going to be relatively
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.080]   high.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:56.880]   And with annuities you have two sets of expenses that you have to pay attention to.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   Now in a fixed annuity contract, the expenses are basically non-existent in the sense that
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.280]   they're already calculated and taken out before your investments are guaranteed to you.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.960]   So in a fixed annuity contract, it's not that there are no expenses, but those expenses
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.760]   are largely blind to you because they're dealt with prior to the guarantees that are made
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   to you.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.920]   But with a variable annuity contract, that is not the case.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.520]   With a variable annuity contract, you need to look at the investment expenses as well
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.200]   as what's called the mortality and expense charge.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.000]   Investment expenses are relatively straightforward.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.400]   Investment expenses are simply the money that's paid to the investment managers of the investment.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.360]   So if you're purchasing a variable annuity that has sub-accounts that are made up of
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.520]   mainstream mutual funds, you're paying the mutual fund manager, the mutual fund management
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.200]   company, the same fees that are going to be paid if you were purchasing that mutual fund
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.360]   on the open market with an open-end mutual fund account.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.460]   And you weren't simply paying them within the context of an annuity count.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:04.120]   So if you're with the BlackRock XYZ fund or the Vanguard ABC fund or whatever, the same
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.640]   investment expenses that you would pay if you owned that mutual fund separately are
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.580]   going to be paid if you have that as a mutual fund sub-account, as a variable annuity sub-account.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.720]   So here, your expenses will range from very low to very high.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.840]   And you have to do the same investment analysis that you do with a mutual fund to see whether
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.320]   those mutual fund expenses are in your best interest.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:34.500]   You can purchase low-cost investments in an annuity just like you can purchase low-cost
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.720]   investments in a mutual fund.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.840]   And in general, you should always look for low-cost investments because one of the most
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:48.240]   reliable predictors of investment performance is low expenses and low costs.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.140]   But in an annuity, that's only one component of the costs.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.180]   It's only one component.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.880]   The other component you have to look at is what's called the mortality and expense charge.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:03.620]   The mortality charge is the insurance company's assessment of the cost of providing you with
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.380]   insurance that's related to your life expectancy.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.160]   The expense charge is the insurance company's charge of the expenses necessary for them
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.520]   to manage the investment contract.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.400]   Together, these mortality and expense charges can be low, they can be moderate, or they
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.040]   can be high.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.200]   Depending on the specific choices that you make.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   In most annuity contracts, you will have a number of choices.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.960]   For example, you will usually have a choice of what kind of death benefit you would like
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   to purchase.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.160]   Let me use a very simplified example.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.120]   You could purchase a death benefit that guarantees that any amount of money that you invest into
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.320]   an annuity contract will be paid out to your beneficiaries no matter the value of the contract
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.880]   at the date of your death.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:54.520]   If you invest $100,000 into an annuity contract, go forward eight years, your investment contract
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.560]   has declined in value to $50,000 due to bad performance in the stock market, and then
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.380]   you die, the insurance company would pay out $100,000 to your beneficiaries.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.500]   That's basically a form of life insurance, and that's calculated by the insurance company
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.360]   in terms of their overall risk and included in the mortality and expense charge.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.720]   Now, usually you can purchase some form of enhanced death benefit.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.360]   There are simple forms of enhanced death benefits that are available with annuities, such as
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.560]   a ratcheting death benefit.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.520]   You invest $100,000 in an annuity contract each year on the policy anniversary.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:36.800]   If the portfolio value is higher than $100,000, then that becomes your new death benefit.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.560]   If it's lower than the previous ratcheted death benefit, it gets ignored.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.640]   So the policy values increase, fast forward five years, your policy values have increased
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.100]   to $150,000 because of good investment performance.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.480]   Then you have three years of decline, so the actual account value of the annuity has declined
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.520]   from $150,000 to $100,000 back.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.960]   And then you die, well your beneficiaries will receive the $150,000 instead of the $100,000
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   account value.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.520]   These are some of the benefits of annuities that are not available with things like open
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.240]   and mutual funds, and they involve this form of life insurance.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.640]   But that comes with a cost, it comes with an expense that's associated with it.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.720]   If a company is offering a difference between a standard death benefit and an enhanced death
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:27.480]   benefit, they're going to also list for you the specific charge that you'll face for that
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.040]   annuity contract.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.440]   This can be an extremely valuable form of a financial planning tool.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.020]   For example, if I have a client that does not have the health necessary to be able to
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.400]   purchase life insurance in the open market, one of the tools to try to make sure that
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.720]   their family is going to be protected is a tool like an annuity death benefit.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.960]   Because when you purchase an annuity, that particular form of life insurance is not medically
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   underwritten.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.320]   So I could have a client where I said, "Hey, let's take this $100,000, it's in open and
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.920]   mutual funds, let's put it into an annuity contract."
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.000]   You can't qualify for life insurance, but if we invest the money aggressively and we
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.060]   choose a ratcheting enhanced death benefit, then that money will be either it'll grow
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:12.080]   a lot and you'll have the money to spend, or if it goes down, at least it'll be available
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.800]   as an enhanced death benefit because there's a good chance that you're going to die early
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.600]   and that'll help your family to have a little bit more money.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   But you would have to assess if that's worth it to you, a feature like that.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.960]   Now there are other features as well that you can purchase in an annuity contract.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.000]   I've seen annuity contracts that have guaranteed increases in the death benefit.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.880]   This was very popular about 10 years ago.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.960]   I haven't looked or analyzed the annuity market contract in the last few years, but this used
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.160]   to be very, very popular where there was a death benefit amount that would grow by a
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.280]   guaranteed amount.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.840]   And that can have its place.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.480]   It also can be very expensive.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.640]   So it's tough to know whether it's worth it to you and a lot of individual consideration
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.020]   is important.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.880]   Back to my dog example, should you buy a $15,000 dog?
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.380]   Well, that depends.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.080]   Should you buy an annuity?
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.720]   Well, that depends.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   And you'll have to go through a careful analysis of the risks, the benefits, and the costs.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.360]   I don't want to go any deeper other than to simply say you can purchase high quality commercial
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.480]   annuities that give you good investments with low expenses.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.540]   You can purchase those and use them to protect money.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.600]   And if you use them, you can also purchase them and own them in a low cost way and you
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.540]   don't have to be committed forever.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:41.160]   You can take several hundred thousand dollars, you can purchase a commercial variable annuity
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:47.740]   from a low cost provider that has modest mortality and expense charges, and you choose investment
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:53.000]   sub-accounts that are modestly priced, and you can have a good investment, which brings
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.540]   me to now sales charges and taxes.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.060]   So the other thing you have to be careful of with the purchase of an annuity is the
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.220]   sales commission that is charged.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.180]   Those sales commissions, most annuities have a sales commission because they're sold by
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.620]   an insurance agent.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.860]   I think there are companies out there that will sell annuity contracts that don't have
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.240]   commissions, but I have not ever worked with those companies, so you'll have to research
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.360]   that yourself.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.900]   But most annuity contracts will have sales commissions.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.980]   Those commissions will usually, can either be paid on what's called a front-end commission
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.260]   or a back-end commission, back to our different shares of mutual funds.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:37.980]   In a world of no-load or no-commission mutual funds, most people have forgotten about A-shares,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   B-shares, C-shares, etc.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.820]   But functionally, with variable annuities, you can either purchase a sales commission
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:51.060]   up front, where you have a lower expense that's deducted from the contract in exchange for
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.980]   a specific commission that comes out of the money up front, or you can pay what's called
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:00.860]   a back-end sales commission, where you don't see any money deducted from your account up
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:05.260]   front, but you pay a higher mortality and expense charge for a period of time.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.780]   That period of time with some companies is a specific period of time, such as six years,
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.980]   eight years, a period of time for other companies is forever.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.380]   But the way it works, if you're paying an up-front sales commission, you take your $100,000
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.940]   to the insurance company, they deposit it, and you're charged a 3% sales commission up
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   front.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.540]   So your account value only shows you $97,000 to begin with.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:36.020]   But your mortality and expense charge may be 1.8% instead of 3.2%.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.760]   On the other side, you could take your $100,000 to the insurance company, you could invest
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.280]   your $100,000, and all $100,000 would flow right to the contract, but you'll be charged
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.940]   a higher expense ratio, a 2.6% for the first eight years, and then it'll change down, something
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.980]   like that.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.260]   And what's better or worse would depend largely on what you thought the investments were going
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:01.740]   to happen, and it'd also depend on what was going to happen with your overall plans for
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.180]   the contract.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:11.500]   If you choose a contract where the sales commission is not charged up front, then you're going
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.860]   to incur a series of surrender fees, where if you surrender the contract within a short
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.360]   amount of time, a surrender charge will be charged to the contract.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.960]   Those charges range from reasonable to unreasonable, to egregious.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.320]   And there'll usually be a sliding scale.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.440]   With some companies it might be 6, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.160]   With some companies it might be 10%, 10%, 5%, 5%, 0.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   You get the idea.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.240]   You have to look at the actual contract, but all of that is spelled out very specifically.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.600]   The point is, if you hold an annuity for an extended period of time, then you can keep
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:54.740]   that annuity and take it back, and you won't pay any expenses on the contract, other than
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.280]   what you paid each year with your management charges.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:05.580]   The reason I'm going into this is because of asset protection planning.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.220]   If you're trying to protect a lump sum of money, you have a million dollars, you're
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:14.820]   getting ready to start a business that you think might expose you to risk, you could
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.360]   easily move that million dollars into an annuity contract.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.280]   And then, fast forward six years, you close that business, eight years, whatever, you
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.140]   could take the money back out of the annuity contract if you no longer want the annuity.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.600]   That's important to know.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.480]   So that's why I'm going into this with such detail, so that you can understand, hey, I
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.840]   can choose something.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.020]   I can choose money that's safe, I can choose a fixed annuity, I could choose money that's
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.360]   more aggressively invested, I can choose to expose myself to the potential of surrender
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.640]   charges or not surrender charges, and meanwhile, if the laws of my state protect it, this annuity
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.560]   can be very valuable to me to protect a lump sum of money.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   Which leads me now to the final thing, which is taxes.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   One of the important things to know with annuities, if you're purchasing annuities, there is a
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.600]   unique system of taxation that's applied to them.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.800]   Functionally, it's similar in some ways to the system of taxation that's applied to retirement
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.840]   accounts.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:19.720]   The money that grows within an annuity contract is not taxed as it grows.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.600]   When you purchase an annuity, unless you're purchasing an annuity inside of a retirement
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.280]   account, which we'll talk about in a moment, the purchase of that annuity is always made
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.880]   with after-tax dollars, money that you've earned and already paid taxes on.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:40.240]   But the inside buildup of values inside the annuity is not taxed, which means you can
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.220]   get a helpful tax deferral on the contract.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.480]   That's very, very useful.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:54.720]   Now when you take the money out of the annuity, the profit on the annuity will be taxed.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:01.720]   I repeat, when you take the money out of the annuity, the profit will be taxed.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:07.680]   If you take it out after, what is it, 59 and a half, I guess, also, then it's taxed like
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.680]   an IRA.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.320]   It's just taxed to you as income.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:18.400]   If you take the money out prior to that age, 59 and a half, then you will be paid tax.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.720]   If you take the profits out of the annuity, then you'll pay an additional 10% penalty
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.080]   tax, like an IRA tax can be.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.560]   Annuity taxation is important for you to think about.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.840]   One benefit to annuities is they can be rolled over from annuity to annuity without incurring
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840]   taxation.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:45.160]   If you've taken a lump sum of money, you've invested it into an annuity contract, then
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:52.480]   10 years from now you decide you want a different annuity contract, you can do a 1030, I always
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   get it messed up, either 1035 or 1031 exchange.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.880]   One of those is for like-kind real property and one of those is for annuity and insurance
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   contracts.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:07.680]   You can do a 1031 exchange, I think, from one annuity into another annuity contract.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:14.160]   You can also do a 1031 exchange from an annuity, I got to make sure I get this right.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   I was wrong, it's 1035, sorry.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.360]   One of those details that has bedeviled my mind for the last 10 years that I've been
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:26.200]   a financial planner is I always get confused which is real property and which is with insurance
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   contracts.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:33.600]   A 1035 exchange is an exchange of annuities, life insurance contracts, and long-term care
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   contracts.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.800]   A 1031 exchange is for real property usually used for real estate to avoid taxation on
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   real estate.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.120]   So, with an annuity, you can do a 1035 exchange from an annuity contract into another annuity
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.780]   contract without incurring taxation.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.760]   You can also do an exchange from a life insurance contract into an annuity contract and there
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:02.080]   are a couple different permutations of going between life and long-term care annuity, etc.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.840]   But 1035 exchanges can be very useful because as those values grow in annuity, you can exchange
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.820]   them from one annuity to another annuity if there's an annuity that better fits your circumstances
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.600]   and better fits your situations.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   You should know that.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.400]   However, if you don't keep an annuity and if you surrender an annuity before 59.5, you
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:27.200]   will pay ordinary income taxes on the gain plus, if it's before 59.5, a 10% penalty tax.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.720]   If it's after 59.5, you'll just pay ordinary income taxes.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.280]   Those taxes are assessed if it's a lump sum, they'll be assessed as a lump sum.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.720]   If you're receiving a series of annuity payments, you'll pay taxes based upon an exclusion ratio,
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.360]   which represents the amount of the annuity contract that was your contribution versus
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.120]   an amount that was your taxable profit.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.860]   Notice the words that I said a moment ago in this long stream of tax words, which was
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.580]   ordinary income.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:58.880]   One of the disadvantages of purchasing annuities is the growth on an annuity is ordinary income,
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.920]   which is usually the highest taxed category for most people.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.840]   This means that although you could purchase variable subaccounts that have investments
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.320]   in them, that's useful, but what you don't get is you don't get the treatment of those
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.440]   accounts as long-term capital gains, which are usually, at least in the current US tax
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.760]   code, a lower tax rate.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.720]   You need to do a tax analysis when purchasing an annuity as well.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.880]   That covers basically taking money, putting it into annuity for the purpose of protecting
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.400]   that money.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.640]   It is a valuable, useful strategy.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.440]   It's also not quite as simple as some of the other strategies we have discussed, but it
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.880]   is a valuable, useful strategy.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.860]   You can take money that is exposed to the claims of creditors because you are holding
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:51.120]   it in just open investment accounts and open bank accounts, and you can purchase an annuity
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:57.160]   that is suited to your investment objectives, and that annuity value can be protected from
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   the claims of your creditors.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:07.200]   Additionally, you can take an annuity and you can protect a sum of money by simply turning
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.960]   it into either a present or a future income.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.520]   I repeat, first long series of planning that took the last 35 minutes to cover, which is
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.760]   to be taking an annuity and putting it into a contract, keeping it as a body of money
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   altogether.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.160]   Now, I'm saying you could take a sum of money and you can protect it by turning it
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.680]   into an income, either a current income or a future income.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.000]   That can be an extremely useful thing.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.800]   Again, consider you're heading into a potential situation where you think in the coming years
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.400]   you'll face increased liability risks.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.680]   You have a sum of money right now, $100,000, $1 million, whatever.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.400]   You have a sum of money and you say, "You know what?
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.200]   I'd like to protect this sum of money.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.640]   I don't think I'm going to need this sum of money now, but what I'll do is I'll
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.600]   go ahead and I will turn this sum of money into a future income stream."
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.540]   You go and you purchase an insurance contract.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.040]   That income stream can come in right away or it can come in in the future.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.440]   You can use that money to purchase an annuity that creates the income stream that's there
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   for you.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.720]   Now, here's what's cool about that.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.800]   Sometimes that income stream will actually be completely protected from the claims of
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.880]   creditors because it is an annuity stream.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   Sometimes you just get a functional protection of that stream of income because the creditor
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.840]   wants a lump sum now.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.320]   They don't want a stream of income, especially if you purchase a deferred annuity.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.360]   You're 40 years old.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.880]   You set up an annuity that's going to pay you an income stream at 65 years old.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.600]   You're sued when you're 43.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.120]   That creditor is going to want to sit around and wait 22 years to receive this stream of
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.440]   payments from the insurance company.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   You can set up the annuity in such a way that's just not available to them.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.280]   This can be really valuable because you still are going to have a death benefit on that
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   contract.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.360]   If you die before you can collect the money at 65, no problem.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.920]   It's just part of your estate and you can direct the beneficiary of that.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.080]   But if you live, you'll just receive it as retirement income.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.680]   That can be very, very useful and it can be very useful to help a creditor to settle for
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   less.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.560]   When you put this together with other asset protection planning techniques, you have some
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.680]   liability insurance that uses to give them a small settlement and you use the power of
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.420]   the fact that, hey, all your assets are locked up, they're unavailable, then you can get
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   a smaller settlement.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.520]   You can settle with them, clear your judgment creditors and be on with your life.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.800]   Annuities can be useful just simply by turning them into a future income stream.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.040]   Don't let the simplicity of that concept make you think it's not useful.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.200]   It can be useful.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.360]   All depends on what your needs are for a sum of money, what your intended purposes are,
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   etc.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:55.140]   Next, annuities can be useful by helping you to protect money that is otherwise exposed
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.460]   to the claims of creditors.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.520]   One of the biggest examples here would be money that's in a retirement account.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:06.200]   There are some states that explicitly protect the money that's in a retirement account from
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.920]   the claims of creditors.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.900]   We talked about that in the retirement exemption program.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:16.120]   There are some states, however, that do not protect the money that's in a retirement account
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:24.080]   from the claims of creditors, but that do protect the money that is in an annuity contract.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.960]   The most important of these states that I've looked into is Georgia.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.880]   Georgia does not protect money that's in an IRA, but they do protect money that is in annuity.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.280]   So if you have money in a Georgia IRA, you should seriously consider using an annuity
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.640]   contract inside of that IRA instead of just simply mutual funds if you are concerned about
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.260]   creditor protection.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.760]   There aren't many other states that I'm aware of that are that way, and you would need to
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.480]   ask a Georgia asset protection attorney.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.640]   Perhaps they'll know problems with that plan that I don't know, but I think that that strategy
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   could work perfectly well.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.760]   There are other states such as Wyoming.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.320]   Wyoming doesn't protect IRA values, but they do protect annuity payments.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.160]   So I think that could work in a state like Wyoming as well.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:13.480]   But the idea here is you can fund in an IRA, you have certain investments that you can
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.760]   put in there and certain investments that you can't.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.440]   So when it comes to asset protection, you can't put a life insurance contract in an
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   IRA.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.640]   That's a prohibited investment.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.400]   But you can put an annuity contract inside of an IRA.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.040]   Usually you will hear the advice that you should never fund an IRA with an annuity.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.360]   It's one of the ones that amateur financial advisors are most confident in.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.560]   Never fund an IRA with an annuity contract.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   And the reasoning is that you don't get any tax benefits from the annuity.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   That is absolutely true.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.160]   You don't get any additional tax deferral or additional tax benefits with an annuity
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.860]   contract that you wouldn't otherwise get with having money inside of an IRA or a Roth IRA.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.400]   You don't get any additional tax benefits.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.240]   The taxation of the IRA supersedes the tax deferral of the annuity.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.600]   And so you're getting additional costs and expenses of the annuity, is usually how the
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.440]   logic goes, additional costs and expenses of the annuity that are unnecessary.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.800]   Just purchase mutual funds.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.440]   However, there are exceptions to that.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.720]   And here are just the meaningful exceptions.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:22.800]   First, the exception can be with regard to asset protection, as I'm describing.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.840]   If you have the protection of an annuity inside of an IRA, then now you have to confront that
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.480]   insurance law in addition to the IRA.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.200]   And that could be a useful way of your protecting a large sum of money that you've accumulated
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:39.160]   in an IRA just simply by putting it into an annuity contract.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:44.760]   Second thing would be benefits of the annuity, such as lifetime income that are useful to
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:50.280]   you, and/or benefits such as those death benefits, enhanced death benefits, things like that.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.760]   And there are financial planning circumstances in which those things could be useful.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.600]   So no problem with the general advice.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.800]   Don't generally put annuities inside of IRAs.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.240]   I think that's good general advice.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.240]   Totally fine.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.880]   It's not good in all circumstances.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.800]   And that's an example of why it's not good.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:14.440]   Next, one of the most useful things of annuities is they are a contract, and they allow you
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:22.240]   to get money out of your probate estate and allow money to pass via beneficiaries.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.480]   And this can help you to protect the claims, can help you protect you against the claims
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.960]   of creditors that would otherwise be assessed upon your estate.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.400]   Now here I'm specifically talking about your estate, which means you will die.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.880]   Some people, some types of asset protection planning are important when we come into planning
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.040]   while you're alive.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.680]   How do you keep control of your money?
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.640]   But remember, if you die and you owe money to people, your creditors will file a claim
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:59.280]   against your estate, and your estate has to stand good for the claims of your creditors.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   How does this work?
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.080]   Well, when you die, some of your assets will be included in what's called your probate
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:10.160]   estate, the assets that will pass through the probate court, and some of your assets
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.960]   will pass outside of your probate estate.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.000]   They pass simply via beneficiary designations.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.060]   The most important one here is to compare something like a life insurance contract to
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.140]   money that's in your bank account.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:30.640]   If you have $100,000 in your bank account, and you die, and you owe your creditors $100,000,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.480]   your creditors will file their claims against your estate, and the executive of your estate
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.960]   will pay your creditors their claims.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:43.580]   And so therefore, the beneficiaries of your estate by will will not receive any money,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.600]   because if you only had $100,000 in your bank account, and you willed that money to your
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.080]   brother or your children, whatever, they won't receive any money because the creditors come
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.680]   ahead of the beneficiaries.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.000]   The beneficiaries have no claim.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:06.260]   Now, differently, if you had $0 in your bank account, you owe $100,000, but you also own
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:12.920]   a life insurance contract with a beneficiary designation on it.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.560]   Now, a life insurance contract is worth $100,000.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:27.600]   When you die, the life insurance company will pay the beneficiary of your contract $100,000.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.860]   Your creditors will file their claims against your estate.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:37.020]   The executor will simply say to those creditors, "The estate has no money.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:42.500]   We have no money to pay you with, and so therefore, your creditors will be unpaid, and the beneficiaries
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.860]   of your life insurance contract will still receive their money."
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.140]   The beneficiaries of a life insurance contract do not owe your debts.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.780]   They do not owe your...
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.780]   They didn't borrow the money.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.240]   They don't owe the money.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   And so they have no connection with your estate.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:02.220]   They're simply the beneficiaries of your life insurance contract, which is not part of your
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:06.260]   probate estate.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.620]   That can be useful.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:13.500]   It can be useful because similar things happen with annuity contracts.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.300]   An annuity contract is an insurance contract that has a beneficiary designation, which
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:23.020]   means that the annuity will pass outside of your probate estate.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:30.720]   If you own $100,000 in an annuity contract and then you die, your executor does not have
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.400]   any function, cannot do anything with that annuity contract.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.040]   It's not part of your probate estate.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.240]   It doesn't get submitted to the probate court.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:43.780]   It passes outside of your probate estate.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:49.160]   Don't mix up your tax planning here with this discussion.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.400]   The life insurance, the value of the contract, and the annuity contract is still part of
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.940]   your taxable estate with regard to settling your debts with the IRS.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.340]   It's still part of your taxable estate.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:06.220]   But with a $10 million estate tax exemption for an individual now, there's really very
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.480]   few people who are going to face that situation.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.820]   I'm just talking about normal, ordinary claims of creditors against your estate.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.900]   This can be very useful as part of retirement planning for people, especially people who
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.260]   are concerned about the risk of long-term care expenses, especially when we talk about
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.500]   Medicaid planning, which we'll talk briefly.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   That's next.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.140]   I'm going to briefly mention Medicaid planning.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:34.620]   But annuities can provide a useful tool for you because they can allow you to establish
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:40.540]   an account where your assets will pass via beneficiary designation outside of your probate
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540]   estate.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.740]   You cannot accomplish that with money in a bank account.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.500]   You cannot accomplish that with individually owned mutual funds.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.100]   You can accomplish that with annuities.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:55.380]   I hope your brain can think of the situations and the financial planning examples in which
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.380]   that would be a useful feature of an annuity.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.300]   Now let's talk about Medicaid planning.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.880]   Annuities can provide an interesting way to impoverish yourself or your estate specifically
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.340]   and especially with things like Medicaid planning.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:14.580]   So Medicaid planning, if you're unfamiliar with this particular idea, Medicaid is a way
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:19.060]   of paying for health expenses for the indigent, people that don't have money.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:24.160]   It's also a way of paying, Medicaid does have long-term care expenses that can be paid.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.220]   So Medicaid will pay for nursing home care for somebody who doesn't have money.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:34.420]   And of course, one of the biggest risks that retirees face is how do I pay for the potential
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:38.660]   expense of a nursing home in my particular circumstance?
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.900]   If I don't have, nursing homes can be very expensive and how do we afford that?
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:47.340]   But the only way that you get any kind of government payment for nursing homes in the
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:53.980]   United States is through Medicaid and to be eligible for Medicaid, you have to be basically
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.060]   broke and bankrupt.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:51:00.100]   You can't have any money and there are very stringent rules on Medicaid as far as how
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.980]   many resources you can have and just a couple of thousand dollars.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.780]   If somebody applies for Medicaid, they can't have more than about $2,000.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.260]   So that's a big, big deal.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.260]   So what do you do?
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.260]   How do you provide for this?
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:17.340]   Well, annuities provide a useful tool for people who are planning for Medicaid expenses
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:23.540]   because they can be set up and allow you to take a sum of money and pay it to the community
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.540]   spouse.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.540]   How does this work?
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.540]   Okay.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:34.700]   Most states, again, require a Medicaid applicant to have no more than $2,000 to their name.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:41.900]   But the states consider the total assets of both the spouse, both the person that needs
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:46.060]   Medicaid and also what's called the community spouse.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:54.140]   If I'm married and I need Medicaid and my wife is alive and living with me, she's the
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.600]   community spouse.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:01.380]   And so because the property of husband and wife is considered to be the property of each
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:06.780]   person fully, then Medicaid says, "Well, listen, all of my wife's assets should go to pay for
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.540]   my long-term care expenses."
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.300]   But what do we do in that circumstance?
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:15.100]   If my wife spends all of our money paying for my long-term care expenses and then I
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.860]   die, she's fully impoverished and now she has no money.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.220]   So what is she going to live on at this point in time?
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   So an annuity is one of the standard ways that you can solve for this because although
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.780]   the resources owned by either spouse are taken into consideration, and the community spouse
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.020]   does have a specific allowance of what they're actually allowed to keep.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:38.380]   It's called the community spouse resource allowance, which is half of all the couple's
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.860]   countable resources, not exceeding a certain limit.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:46.720]   It comes out to about $123,000 according to the federal law, and each state can have a
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   lower limit.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.900]   Some states are very, very low.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:55.300]   But if a couple has too many resources to qualify for Medicaid, then the Medicare rules
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.500]   require the money actually be spent before the applicant qualifies for Medicaid.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.580]   It's called spending down the assets.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.020]   So Medicaid doesn't care what the money is spent on.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.420]   They just have to be spent down and the money has to be spent down.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:11.640]   So you can pay for your housing, your medical bills, the long-term care expenses, whatever.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.620]   But when the money is gone, then Medicaid will step in.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:23.500]   However, income for the community spouse is not counted in the Medicaid rules.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.580]   Income is counted to only if it's received by the Medicaid applicant.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.860]   And so that's a really important thing.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:36.420]   The community spouse's income is exempted from the Medicaid formulas.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.380]   And so you can use an annuity as a way to deplete an asset.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.540]   Because if you take an amount of money and you purchase an annuity with it, and that
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:51.940]   annuity stream of payments goes to the community spouse, and the community spouse's income
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:59.180]   is not counted towards Medicaid eligibility, then basically that asset disappears from
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.540]   the Medicaid planning circumstance.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:05.700]   It doesn't cause someone to be ineligible for Medicaid, which means that the assets
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:10.820]   don't have to be spent down on other things, and those assets are now available to the
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.780]   community spouse for -- that stream of income is available to support the community spouse.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.020]   Now there are some detailed rules that need to be followed on that.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:25.260]   The annuity payments have to be completed before the end of the community spouse's
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.760]   life expectancy.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.860]   So it can't be purchased as a gift to heirs.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:33.420]   It has to come in for the life expectancy of the community spouse based upon the Social
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.940]   Security life expectancy tables.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.420]   It has to be a single premium immediate annuity.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.660]   It has to pay out in a series of substantially equal payments.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.380]   It can't be irrevocable.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.820]   It must be non-assignable, non-transferable.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:55.460]   And the Medicaid agency has to be designated as the primary beneficiary of the annuity
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.740]   after the death of the community spouse.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.860]   So that way if there are any unpaid funds that were expected to go to the community
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:05.260]   spouse, then they actually go to the Medicaid agency.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.780]   But this is an example of how annuities can provide an interesting way of basically impoverishing
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:17.640]   yourself and/or your estate, but yet -- on paper, but yet not actually impoverishing
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.340]   yourself in reality.
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.340]   So consider that.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.300]   Now, let's talk about annuities and bankruptcy.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.300]   One of the important parts of asset protection planning is always to consider bankruptcy
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.900]   and bankruptcy law.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:34.500]   And these two things flow together in a very tight way.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.380]   If you disconnect them, you miss out.
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:43.140]   And one of the ultimate reasons is basically the last-ditch effort of a creditor is to
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.960]   force you into bankruptcy, to force you into an involuntary bankruptcy.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.980]   So you can be in a situation in which you never borrow money.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.980]   You have assets.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.020]   You never borrow money.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:59.560]   And because you never borrow money, then you're not at a high risk of bankruptcy.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.500]   No one's going to foreclose on your house if there's no mortgage on it.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   Nobody's going to repossess your car if there's no car payment.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.060]   Your credit card company can't sue you, and you have to declare bankruptcy if you
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.840]   don't have any credit card debts.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:16.060]   But you've still faced some kind of legal liability or legal judgment, and you lose
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.060]   that lawsuit.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.620]   You lose that lawsuit.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.460]   Your creditors come after you.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:25.980]   They can't get anything because all of your assets are owned in exempt asset classes.
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.220]   And because of this, you're still protected.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.340]   But their ultimate recourse is, if they can follow all the rules, to force you into involuntary
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:41.100]   bankruptcy and then file their petition in bankruptcy court and be paid out by the bankruptcy
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.100]   trustee.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.380]   And so that's one of the reasons why we always think about bankruptcy.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.860]   Then, of course, the more practical reason is we always think about bankruptcy because
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.180]   it's always possible that you could go bankrupt.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:53.060]   So let's talk about annuities in bankruptcy.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:57:02.620]   In annuities, depending on whether your annuity is counted, whether your state uses the federal
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:09.180]   bankruptcy codes or its own state-specific codes, your annuity can be an exempt asset.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:16.740]   According to the federal bankruptcy exemptions, your exemption for an annuity in an IRA is
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:21.300]   going to be the same as, or other non-qualified retirement plan, is going to be the same $1.2
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:26.500]   million that is protected by the federal bankruptcy exemption.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.620]   Each state has their own particular annuity exemptions as well.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:35.300]   So you can look into the bankruptcy exemptions, and you should, because remember, that's always
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:41.420]   one of the key points, one of the ultimate last case ways that a creditor can collect
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.460]   against you is force you into involuntary bankruptcy.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.780]   One other component of annuities that I want to talk about, though, is in terms of one
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:57.260]   of the exceptions, especially in bankruptcy court, one of the exempt income streams.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:04.900]   So annuities that are providing an income stream can usually be exempted from bankruptcy
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:14.580]   court if the annuities are for managing insurance proceeds, the payout of an insurance policy,
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.700]   or annuities are the rollover of some kind of pension account, IRA, 401(k), retirement
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:24.980]   account, or are sometimes lottery winnings or a structured settlement from a lawsuit.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:29.220]   And so one of the useful things that you should always consider is if you're going to receive
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:33.300]   a lump sum of money, and you want that lump sum of money to be protected from the claims
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:38.980]   of creditors, perhaps you should receive that lump sum of money as an annuity payment.
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:44.260]   That's really important, especially when it comes to things like life insurance payouts.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.700]   Many people have this idea that with life insurance, the best thing to do if you're
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:52.860]   going to be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is that you should just automatically
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:55.980]   take the money and run, take the lump sum and run.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.100]   That might be fine.
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   That might be wise.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.780]   You maybe should take that lump sum of money, take the $2 million, call up your investment
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.280]   manager and invest it into a portfolio with your investment manager.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.340]   But if there's any kind of possibility of a contentious situation with a creditor, or
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:15.660]   if there is an active situation of a contentious situation with a creditor, you should be very,
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:16.660]   very careful.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:22.120]   Remember back to the example that I talked about where an estate has creditors.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:27.700]   What would you do if you are in a situation where you know that when you die, your estate
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:31.780]   is going to have many, many creditors, those creditors are going to file claims against
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:37.660]   your probate estate, but yet you're still seeking to care for your spouse and your children?
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:41.700]   Well, if I were in that situation, if I had a lot of creditors that were coming after
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.820]   me, basically the instructions I would give to my wife would be very, very simple.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.780]   Number one, honey, we've got plenty of life insurance.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.900]   The life insurance proceeds are going to be protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.340]   Doesn't matter how all this stuff works, shakes out with regard to all these claims
[00:59:55.340 --> 01:00:00.260]   of creditors of our estate, my probate estate is going to have to be settled, it's going
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.080]   to pay for the claims of creditors, but the life insurance contract is protected.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.100]   Number two, honey, keep the money with the insurance company.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.100]   Do not co-mingle the money.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.280]   Do not take the money and put it in a bank account.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.500]   Even if it's ultimately protected based upon its origin, based upon its provenance, even
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.860]   if it's ultimately protected, that doesn't mean that it's practically protected.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:30.820]   And all of a sudden I start mingling the money with the other assets, and all of a sudden
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.300]   creditors start taking out judgments, they file claims against bank accounts.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.380]   Don't co-mingle the money.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.140]   Keep the money with the insurance company.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.260]   A good insurance company is happy to have the money, they'll pay you a good interest
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.820]   rate out, they'll keep it totally separate, and you'll never have any problem whatsoever
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.620]   of proving that the money is with the insurance company.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.100]   Take a small sum of money from the insurance contract.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.480]   You can usually, with most big insurance companies, they will send you a checkbook.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.900]   They'll send you a checkbook, you have a million dollars sitting with them, they'll
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   send you a checkbook.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.220]   You could write one check for one million dollars, take it down to your bank and you
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.220]   can cash that check.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.500]   I would tell my wife, "Do not do that."
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.980]   You can also take that checkbook and you can stroke individual checks to the funeral home,
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.300]   you can stroke individual checks to the landlord, you can stroke an individual check to yourself
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.860]   and you can cash it and use that to buy groceries, whatever you want to do.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.020]   Use the checkbook and take a little bit of lump sum of money out in order to pay for
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.020]   expenses.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:27.380]   Then, I would very seriously charge her, "Consider just taking an annuity from the insurance
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.380]   company."
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:33.980]   Now, obviously the insurance agent and the insurance company have an incentive to sell
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980]   you an annuity.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.060]   The insurance agent wants to make their money.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.660]   But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing for you to have the annuity.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.620]   And annuity payments that are as received as insurance proceeds are protected from the
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.740]   claims of creditors due to their original characterization and due to the federal bankruptcy
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   laws.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.020]   So those annuity characterizations are really, really important.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.920]   You can take an annuity for some of the money, you can take an annuity for all of the money,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.220]   you can take an annuity payment that comes in for life, you can take an annuity payment
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.180]   that comes in for life with benefits.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.700]   There are dozens and dozens of options and you can set it up properly where the spouse
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.060]   and the children are taken care of.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.500]   And you can do this and keep all the money protected from the claims of creditors.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.620]   You can take an annuity payment, you can purchase a life insurance contract.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.220]   My wife could purchase a life insurance contract on her life with the kids as beneficiaries.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.780]   Again, we've got everything outside of the probate estate, everything outside of even
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.380]   the taxable estate if we set it up separately.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.460]   It's a powerful, powerful tool.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:36.740]   So don't ignore the value of annuities, especially for things like insurance proceeds from a
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.460]   death claim.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:44.040]   It's one of the best, simplest, cheapest ways to provide for a spouse, especially if my
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.760]   estate is embroiled in all kinds of problems.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.620]   Maybe I started a big business, I've got financial problems all over the place, I've got creditors
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.460]   calling left and right, I've got legal judgments against me, I've got, who knows, civil judgments
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:59.340]   against me, same thing, I've got criminal judgments against me, I've got problems all
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   over the place.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.820]   That life insurance policy is a very, very useful tool.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.420]   Turn that life insurance policy into a stream of payments for my wife, she's going to be
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.580]   cared for even as the lawyers deal with the mess of my estate.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.820]   That's one of the reasons I love life insurance so much.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:25.900]   Now let's talk about a couple of really kind of top end ways that annuities can be used.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.540]   This is going to go with some really high end financial planning.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:33.020]   I know we're going long, I know we've got the lawnmowers going in the background, forgive
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.700]   me it's the challenge that Florida podcasters face, is figuring out how to have a quiet
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.740]   place away from the lawnmowers.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.620]   But I feel like this is worth it.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:45.420]   This will not apply, this is no longer dealing with mere mortals, so if you're a mere mortal
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.980]   and you don't care about this stuff, just skip on past.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.620]   But if you're dealing with the higher end stuff, there are some other interesting ways
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:56.620]   that annuities can be used at the very, very high end.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:02.020]   Thus far in this show, when I have been using the term annuity, I have been referring primarily
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:07.540]   to commercial insurance products, annuities that are purchased from commercial insurance
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.540]   companies.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.260]   But the use of the word annuity is not exclusive to commercial products.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.860]   So I'm going to deal with one example here from going offshore and how annuities can
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:23.900]   be a useful component of going offshore, especially if you're already in an antagonistic situation
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:29.140]   and you're trying to plan in the middle of dealing with the uniform fraudulent transfers
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.800]   provisions.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.380]   And then I want to deal briefly with annuities in an estate planning context, specifically
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:41.420]   grats and crats, and how these can be useful to you if you are dealing with a large estate
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.980]   and how you can still get creditor protection.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.260]   My source here, I'm going to read to you a short excerpt from perhaps one of the most
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:53.860]   useful higher end asset protection planning books written by Arnold Goldstein and Ryan
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.280]   Fowler called Asset Protection in Financially Unsafe Times, a guide for professional advisors
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.660]   and their clients.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:04.340]   It's one of the higher end books and it's fairly dense.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.580]   So if you're a professional financial planner, you'll find this useful.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:11.580]   If you are not interested in the dense, like if you're not comfortable with a lot of the
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:15.260]   terms, etc, this is not a good starting level book for you.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.400]   So listen and always listen to things that are beyond your current vocabulary, but this
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.900]   will not be a good place for you.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:27.900]   But I want to read a short excerpt from page 65 of the book, 65 and 66, wherein the authors
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:34.900]   are talking about how to plan against basically the uniform fraudulent transfers laws.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:40.860]   So quick reminder, when we get to offshore planning, which I'm probably not going to
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.740]   do in this series just because it's beyond my legal competence and it's better to talk
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.180]   to an attorney, but when you get to offshore planning, one of the biggest challenges that
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.300]   you face is the risk of being held in contempt of court.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:57.700]   If you go and talk to an attorney today and you start talking about asset protection planning,
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.380]   usually they'll jump first to exemptions.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:04.500]   Everything that I've been talking about here is in terms of exemptions, exemptions, exemptions.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.660]   The reason is because exemptions are solid.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.460]   They're well codified in law, they're well practiced, they're proven, exemptions work.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.760]   That's why I'm talking about exemption planning.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:17.460]   When you start to go offshore, then either sometimes you're trying to protect things
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:22.580]   based upon privacy or you're trying to get into some additional legal trickery.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.820]   And the risk is simply this.
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:29.380]   You can set up an offshore asset protection trust, but your risk is what if the judge
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.940]   just says to you, "Repatriate the assets."
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.400]   And you've got to prove to the judge that you can't repatriate the assets.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.960]   Because if you say to the judge, "Hey, judge, listen, I'm sorry.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.540]   This money's in an offshore trust.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.100]   I'm not the trustee of it.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.020]   I have no authority over the trust itself.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.260]   I just can't do it."
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.200]   Well, that's the idea behind good legal planning with an offshore asset protection trust is
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.060]   you basically put yourself in a situation where you say, "I can't do it.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.580]   I can't repatriate the money, judge.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.580]   I have no problems."
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:59.100]   If the judge doesn't believe you, what'll happen is the judge will find you in contempt
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.940]   of court and they'll throw you in jail and so you'll sit in prison.
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.980]   Yeah, your creditors aren't getting paid, but you'll sit in prison.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.260]   And there are plenty of examples of people who have faced that situation.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.340]   You're held in contempt of court.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   You're sitting in prison.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.460]   Judge says, "We can get out of prison whenever you bring the money back."
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.860]   And they just don't believe that you can't get the money back.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.500]   So it's not enough just to say that you can't get the money back.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.340]   You've got to actually not be able to get the money back.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:26.660]   And you can set it up in such a way with your offshore trusts that you can't actually get
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.420]   the money back, but yet you could still benefit from the trust.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.420]   It can be done.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:36.660]   And there are plenty of people who have won their cases against even regular creditors,
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.260]   against super creditors like the IRS.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.820]   You can set it up so that you can win the case.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.700]   It's beyond my ability to do that, but I'm convinced based on looking at some of the
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.460]   cases, looking at the writings by the attorneys, it is possible to do.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.660]   But you've got to do it right.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:53.540]   And one of the things about doing it right is you've got to do it in advance, but it's
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:08:01.460]   especially problematic if you're facing certain issues where circumstances have already arisen
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.400]   that are giving threat to the claim.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.300]   So listen to how an annuity can be used in an offshore trust.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:12.700]   I love this example here that the author gives here and how annuities can provide a useful
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.100]   component of offshore planning.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:18.380]   Again, reading from Asset Protection in Financially Unsafe Times, a guide for advisors and their
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.980]   clients by Arnold Goldstein and Ryan Fowler.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.060]   The first thing you need to know about offshore planning is not all offshore plans are immune
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.060]   from creditors.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.660]   In fact, most aren't because most aren't set up properly.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:33.440]   Several high-end, expensive offshore plans, all involving a straightforward transfer of
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:38.640]   assets to an offshore trust, have in actuality failed when put to the test.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.820]   The good news about offshore planning is your assets move outside of a US judge's jurisdiction.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:48.780]   Therefore, when implemented in a careful and proper manner, offshore planning may work
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.580]   even if the transfer is deemed fraudulent.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:57.180]   However, the bad news is while your assets are outside of a judge's grasp, you are
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.140]   in the judge's grasp while you remain in the USA.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:06.060]   A judge could order you to repatriate offshore assets, and unless you can prove your inability
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.140]   to do so, he can incarcerate you for failing to do so.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.340]   In light of the above, it is best to treat your offshore transactions as if they were
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:19.460]   still subject to US law, because you are, and I'll interrupt the commentary here to
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.560]   say, unless you aren't, which you should also make provisions to get yourself outside
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.500]   of the US and not be underneath the US judge's jurisdiction.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.820]   Go back to the text.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:32.380]   If the transfer is not voidable under US law, then you don't even test the offshore aspect
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.580]   of your plan.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.180]   In other words, you'll have other layers of defense that need to be breached before
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.700]   the offshore aspect kicks in.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:44.300]   This is what asset protection planners refer to as multi-layered protection, or defense
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.380]   in depth.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:49.620]   In regards to this strategy, it's usually not wise to use an offshore asset protection
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:54.380]   trust as a first line of defense, because under the laws of 42 states, the trust's
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.380]   assets are attachable by creditors.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.460]   This means a US judge might not look too kindly on your offshore trust.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.000]   The trick is to avoid badges of fraud as much as possible.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.420]   Make your transfer an exchange of equivalent value, use charging order protection, which
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.800]   is recognized under US law as opposed to a foreign jurisdiction self-settled asset protection
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.540]   trust law, which isn't, and have a valid economic purpose for your transfer so as to
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:23.040]   demonstrate your transfer was done with an intent other than to defraud a creditor.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.140]   After all the foregoing has been done, you still need to make sure your transfer offshore
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.420]   is done so that you can prove to a court it's impossible for you to repatriate assets, especially
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.380]   if you do offshore planning after creditor threats arise.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:41.420]   Thus, if your transfer is deemed fraudulent, you can't be held in contempt.
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.780]   With the above in mind, there is a provision of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, UFTA,
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.340]   that gives a proper offshore plan a lot of power.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:53.060]   This provision is so powerful that one may call it the holy grail of asset protection
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.120]   planning.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:00.540]   It may be the only way to fully protect your assets if a storm of the century lawsuit arises
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:05.620]   and you don't yet have an asset protection plan, which means anything you do is at risk
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:11.180]   of being deemed a fraudulent transfer under Section 4A1 of the UFTA.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.500]   This provision is Section 8A of the UFTA.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:20.620]   It states, "A transfer or obligation is not voidable under Section 4A1 against a person
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:27.440]   who took, in good faith, and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.780]   transferee or obligee."
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.660]   This is important to understand.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:38.780]   The UFTA gives one and only one situation where a transfer is not voidable, meaning
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:45.180]   the transfer won't be undone, even if the transfer was done with fraudulent intent.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:53.120]   The transferee must have given the transferor something of equivalent value for the transfer,
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.820]   and the transferee must have done the transaction in good faith.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:03.460]   Setting up an offshore trust or LLC by itself does not meet these criteria.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.560]   Transferring assets to an offshore trust almost always involves a gift, and therefore there
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.280]   is no exchange of equivalent value.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.180]   Although an exchange of equivalent value is present when you capitalize an offshore LLC,
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:21.500]   you get an interest in the company in exchange for giving the LLC assets, the LLC will probably
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.780]   not be considered a transferee in good faith if you are the one who set up the company.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.700]   For the good faith criterion to be met beyond dispute, the transferee must be a completely
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:37.260]   impartial party who does the transaction in their normal course of business.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:43.060]   Fortunately, there is such a transferee, an offshore insurance company.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.940]   Let's examine the following scenario.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:50.900]   An offshore insurance company manages $250 billion in assets and has been in business
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.820]   over 100 years.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.740]   A creditor threat materializes and you're caught unprotected or your asset protection
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.300]   plan is seriously flawed.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:06.220]   Consequently, you place your liquid assets in an offshore LLC, and you take the equity
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:11.940]   out of your real estate and other assets by setting up and exercising lines of credit
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.540]   with the hard assets as security for the lines of credit.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.940]   You then place the line of credit funds offshore as well.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.900]   Your offshore LLC then uses these funds to purchase a foreign annuity from the foreign
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.180]   insurer.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.100]   In doing so, you have accomplished the following.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:35.740]   One, you've transferred your assets to a non-insider for something of equivalent value,
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:40.540]   the annuity contract, that has little or no worth to a creditor.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.740]   After all, even if they could seize the annuity contract, which they couldn't, they'd have
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.740]   to wait years to receive enough payments to satisfy their judgment.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:54.960]   There is a viable economic purpose for this other than asset protection, and therefore
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.220]   you make it harder for a creditor to prove the transfer was done with fraudulent intent.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:06.420]   Two, because the transfer was made in exchange for an item of equivalent value and the annuity
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:12.020]   purchase was in good faith in regards to the transferee, the insurance company, the transfer
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:20.700]   is not voidable under Section 8A of the UFTA, even if the debtor did it to hinder, delay,
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.140]   or defraud a creditor.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:30.560]   Three, the foreign insurer is a large, reputable, and well-established, and is in a jurisdiction
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.140]   that not only does not recognize a U.S. court order, but forbids annuity contracts from
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.480]   being surrendered to creditors.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.580]   This is almost certainly ample evidence that the debtor is unable to repatriate assets
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.500]   if the transfer is voidable, which greatly reduces the chance of being held in contempt
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.540]   if assets are not repatriated.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:56.060]   We must note that you may be able to use this strategy by purchasing a domestic annuity,
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.500]   however there are some problems with the domestic approach.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.100]   Notwithstanding Section 8A of the UFTA, some states' laws, especially fraudulent conversion
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:08.500]   laws, may specifically set aside purchases of annuities or life insurance if done with
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.380]   fraudulent intent.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:15.660]   Also it is almost impossible to set up an annuity where payments are made to an LLC,
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.940]   or other entity the debtor could then receive distributions from, without that entity being
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.900]   subject to reverse piercing.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:26.060]   For example, if an LLC received annuity payments, this might not be considered a valid business
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:30.420]   purpose for the LLC, and thus the LLC could be reverse pierced.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:35.380]   In comparison, an offshore structure must be used in order to purchase an offshore annuity,
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:39.620]   as the foreign insurer will not do business directly with a U.S. person.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.380]   Consequently, if annuity payments are made to the debtor, or to an entity he holds an
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.820]   interest in, then a creditor may or may not attach those payments when they're made,
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:51.780]   depending on whether or not those payments are exempt from attachment in a particular
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.920]   state.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.620]   Offshore planning has the additional advantage of placing assets outside a U.S. court's
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.660]   jurisdiction, assuming we can prove it's impossible to repay trade assets of course.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.620]   Offshore annuities are much more flexible and typically have a much higher rate of return
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:08.660]   than domestic ones, and the offshore annuity may be exempt from creditor claims under foreign
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.660]   law.
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:16.540]   I give that to you with those two pages from Goldstein and Fowler's book, because you may
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:22.300]   need it someday, especially if you are a person of means, but don't rely on that, don't be
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.340]   in that situation, I beg of you, don't be in that situation where you are ultimately
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.060]   exposed.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.900]   Do the planning now, and your planning will be much, much stronger.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:37.380]   But if you're ever in a situation where you need it, you now know where to go for one
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:43.620]   idea that could possibly save your assets if you are facing a massive, massive problem.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:49.420]   I want to close with a brief discussion of a couple of estate planning tools that can
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:54.580]   also be basically formed as a form of annuity.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:17:00.100]   There are a variety of different estate planning tools that involve the use of the name annuity.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.700]   Remember, an annuity can be something that you purchase, but it's basically a concept
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.260]   which means a distribution of money for an expected period of time, sometimes based upon
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.860]   the life of a person, sometimes just a series of payments.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:17.740]   And so in estate planning, there are a number of estate planning tools that we use.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:21.300]   And usually you'll hear estate planners refer to these by their acronyms.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.460]   And the acronyms mean different things.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:30.340]   So for example, you can have a CRAT, a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, or a CRT, a Charitable
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:36.080]   Remainder Trust, and you have a CRUT, a Charitable Remainder Unit Trust, or a GRAT, or a GRUT,
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.220]   or all these different things.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:44.540]   But when you use the term annuity, then you can think about this in the context of exemption
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.540]   planning.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.460]   So let me just give you two examples here.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:52.060]   One example would be a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:57.860]   Now a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust, commonly referred to as a GRAT, is a way that you set
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.880]   up your assets to try to build estate tax savings.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.220]   And here it's usually an estate planning tool.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.260]   And the reason we're talking about this is asset protection draws from business planning,
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.300]   it draws from estate planning, it draws from tax planning.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.460]   But a GRAT is a way that you save on estate taxes.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:18.540]   You set up a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust and you make a large donation to that trust.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.140]   It's an irrevocable trust.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:25.420]   And then when you transfer money, you'd make the donation to the trust, the GRAT pays the
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:31.500]   original person, the trustor, an annual annuity payment for a fixed period of time.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:37.020]   And then at the end of the term, at the end of the time, then any remaining assets that
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.220]   are in the GRAT are passed on to the beneficiary as a gift.
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.500]   And the tax benefit comes from the idea that the principal donated to the GRAT will increase
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:54.460]   in value and that the interest that's paid back to the owner will be less than the appreciation.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:19:01.260]   So you're moving money out of your taxable estate into another, into a separate entity,
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.060]   a separate trust, which will then go on to your beneficiary.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:09.180]   And you take various exemptions, sorry, various deductions of value for that and you take
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.580]   various tax deductions for that.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.420]   Now you can do something similar with a Charitable Remainder Trust.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.900]   A Charitable Remainder Trust is the idea where you transfer property into the trust, you
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.660]   receive annual payments from the trust for your lifetime, and then when you die and the
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:29.380]   trust terminates and the money, the remaining assets that are in the trust go on to a charity.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:34.980]   And so you're allowed an income tax deduction when you make the contribution and you can
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:39.380]   take various discounts on the assets because of the controlled nature of it.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.780]   And so it can be a very useful thing.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.500]   But these can also be used as a way of your protecting significant assets from the claims
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.820]   of your creditors.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:51.980]   For the sake of brevity, I'm going to read two more pages from Goldstein and Fowler's
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.620]   book wherein they talk about Charitable Remainder Trusts.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:20:00.620]   And you can see how this can be used also with regard to asset protection and protecting
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:04.000]   assets, getting them outside of your estate, saving money on estate tax savings, taking
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.180]   an income for yourself, protecting that income from the claims of creditors.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:11.500]   And then also here they talk about setting up a wealth replacement trust so that your
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.140]   children are also cared for.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:18.260]   Let me read the text and then if I feel like it needs it, I'll explain any details.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.260]   Charitable Remainder Trusts.
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.580]   The Charitable Remainder Trust is defined by section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code,
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.300]   is a popular estate planning tool that provides for multiple benefits.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.560]   Essentially a grantor transfers property to a Charitable Remainder Trust and receives
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.740]   annual payments from the trust for his lifetime or for a designated number of years, after
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.760]   which the trust terminates.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.560]   Upon the trust's termination, all remaining assets, the remainder, pass to a charity or
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.500]   charities in accordance with the trust agreement.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.980]   Even though remaining trust assets do not pass to charity until the trust's termination,
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:55.540]   the grantor is allowed an income tax deduction the year the trust is created that is equal
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:58.580]   to the estimated value of the charitable remainder gift.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.760]   This deduction is often very significant.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:04.860]   For example, let's say Tim creates a CRAT, Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, CRAT,
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.640]   and funds it with $1,000,000.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.860]   The CRAT will terminate upon his death and in the meantime, he receives annual income
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.580]   payments of $100,000 annually.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:18.540]   In accordance with IRS-approved actuarial tables, by the time Tim dies, the trust should
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.860]   have a remainder of $500,000.
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:28.580]   This means in the year the trust is created, Tim may take a $500,000 income tax deduction.
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:34.840]   Assuming Tim receives $500,000 or more that year as ordinary income, then his tax savings
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.280]   will be more than $170,000.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.940]   There are essentially three types of charitable remainder trusts.
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:45.940]   The Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, CRAT, Charitable Remainder Unit Trust, CRUT, and
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:49.980]   the Net Income with Makeup Charitable Remainder Unit Trust, NMCRUT.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.020]   CRATs distribute a fixed dollar amount each year, whereas a CRUT has a percentage of overall
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   trust assets distributed each year.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.320]   The value of the CRUT's corpus is evaluated annually in order to determine the actual
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.140]   dollar amount distributed.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.700]   We'll discuss the NMCRUT later.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.060]   For a CRT to qualify, a Charitable Remainder Trust to qualify as such, it must meet the
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.420]   following criteria.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:12.260]   A CRAT must pay at least 5%, but no more than 50% of its initial corpus annually.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:17.600]   A CRUT must pay at least 5%, but no more than 50% of its corpus in accordance with its annual
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.060]   valuation amount.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.220]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder to charity.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:28.460]   A CRT may last a maximum of 20 years or for the lifetime or lives of the grantors.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.320]   When the grantors die, all remaining trust assets must pass to a charity that meets the
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.420]   criteria set forth in Section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.700]   CRTs are ideal for almost anyone who plans to give away some of their estate to charity
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.380]   when they die.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:46.780]   This is because a normal charitable gift upon their death only qualifies for an estate tax
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:51.060]   deduction, wherein the gift is not included in the grantor's taxable estate.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:57.140]   However, property gifted to a CRT qualifies for an estate tax and income tax deduction.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:03.140]   Plus, the CRT assets may be invested and grown inside the CRT tax-free.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:07.240]   Only annual distributions to the grantor are taxable when they are made.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.080]   Because a CRT's assets are exempt from taxation while in the trust, many tax planners recommend
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.860]   the transfer of highly appreciated assets to a CRT, so those assets may be sold tax-free
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.680]   while the assets remain in trust.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.700]   Although many people like the fact that the CRTs meet their charitable goals while providing
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:29.340]   a steady income stream and a sizable income tax deduction, some people are hesitant to
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:32.500]   use one because they'd rather have their wealth pass to heirs.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:38.340]   However, if a CRT is used in conjunction with a wealth replacement trust, then the grantor,
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.020]   charity, and heirs all come out on top.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:46.020]   This is because the income tax deduction taken when a CRT is funded provides extra cash that
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:50.220]   may be used to purchase a life insurance policy held in the wealth replacement trust, which
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.980]   is essentially an irrevocable life insurance trust in ILLIT.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.580]   When the CRT's grantor dies, the life insurance proceeds pass to heirs in lieu of the charitable
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   gift.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:03.980]   Thus, the charity receives the gift from the CRT, the heirs receive the life insurance
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:10.220]   proceeds, both assets pass outside the grantor's taxable estate, and everyone is happy.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:14.220]   Though CRTs have many benefits, one complaint we often hear is that a grantor must receive
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:16.480]   distributions from the trust each year.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.200]   Many individuals would prefer to receive little or no distributions initially and then receive
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.140]   more distributions later after they retire.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:27.260]   He goes on to talk about how he can make up that difference by using a NIMCRUD.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.260]   Let's skip that.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:32.380]   From an asset protection perspective, how does the CRT fare?
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.500]   The answer is the principle fares well, but the income distributions may be attached by
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.620]   a beneficiary's creditor as they're made.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.500]   The workaround, of course, is to make the beneficiary, get ready for this, a disregarded
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.740]   entity multiple member LLC, a DEM LLC.
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.660]   Although a person or entity other than the grantor or DEM LLC may be used, this may not
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:58.300]   be a good idea as the income will probably then constitute a taxable gift from the grantor
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.220]   to the beneficiary.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:04.580]   Since the DEM LLC is completely disregarded from the grantor, however, it may safely be
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:09.180]   designated as the CRT beneficiary without triggering adverse tax consequences.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:16.180]   Alright, if you're still with me, briefly, let me explain what a DEM LLC is and why this
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.660]   is important for an asset protection strategy.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:27.580]   These authors put forward the concept of a disregarded entity multi-member LLC.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:32.700]   You create that disregarded entity multi-member LLC and you've set it as the beneficiary of
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.220]   the charitable remainder trust.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:40.020]   Now, an LLC is a pass-through entity that can provide, because of the entity selection,
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.900]   some asset protection benefits.
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:49.060]   But usually, if a pass-through entity is going to be pass-through from a tax perspective,
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:54.300]   it's only going to be taxed based upon the beneficiary of the LLC, it's usually a sole
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.300]   member LLC.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:26:00.420]   And so the question is, how do you get asset protection planning for a sole member LLC?
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.420]   You really don't.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.620]   A sole member LLC does not provide much asset protection planning, especially in this kind
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.140]   of context.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.980]   So what you need is a multi-member LLC.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:21.100]   But how do you create a multi-member LLC that passes the income through but gets you asset
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.580]   protection planning?
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:30.100]   And so what they have done is advance the idea of creating a defective trust, so a defective
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.180]   grantor trust that's an irrevocable grantor trust, and making that irrevocable grantor
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.780]   trust one member of the LLC.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.900]   Because the trust is defective, the income tax liability of that trust, even though it's
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:49.440]   an irrevocable trust, the income tax liability of that trust stays with the grantor.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.340]   But then the grantor is additionally an additional member of the LLC.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:27:00.400]   And so functionally what you've done is you've created a multi-member LLC that satisfies
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.440]   the asset protection needs of having a multi-member LLC, wherein all the members of the LLC, the
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.540]   tax liability stays with one single member.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:14.380]   Because that single member has the tax liability as the member and also as the grantor of the
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:15.880]   defective trust.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.860]   So that's what the DEM LLC is.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:23.380]   So if you create a charitable remainder trust, you have a measure of asset protection for
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.380]   those assets.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.980]   And let me just expand on the beauty of this particular concept.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.820]   Who are we trying to protect here?
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:34.180]   We're trying to protect the individual, the wealthy individual who has assets and they
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:39.940]   want to receive income tax deductions, estate tax deductions, and creditor protection.
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:43.260]   So they transfer the assets into the charitable remainder trust.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.260]   That's good.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.200]   You transfer the assets into the charitable remainder trust.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.580]   The assets in that trust are protected from the claims of the individual while they're
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.660]   in the trust.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.980]   But because the individual is receiving annuity payments, those annuity payments are exposed
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:02.060]   potentially as an income source of the individual to the claims of their creditors.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.060]   That's okay.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.340]   We solve that in a moment with the DEM LLC.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:09.620]   But while the assets are in that remainder trust, they're protected from the claims of
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.700]   the creditors.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.580]   Those assets will flow eventually to a charity.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.020]   So that charitable contribution is protected for the ultimate charity.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:21.980]   By setting up a wealth replacement trust, a trust that holds a life insurance policy
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:27.300]   on the life of the wealthy person, with that life insurance policy flowing to the beneficiaries,
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:31.020]   flowing to the children, you've protected those assets from the claims of creditors.
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:34.420]   And you use the income tax savings to fund the wealth replacement trust to pay for the
[01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.300]   life insurance premiums.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.580]   Because it's life insurance, you have protection.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.300]   Because it's the beneficiaries, you have protection.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.520]   Because it's the irrevocable trust, you have protection.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520]   So that's useful.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.820]   So that protects the assets for the beneficiaries, for your children.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.900]   It protects the money for your children.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:56.180]   And then the ultimate little flourish on top is you add this disregarded entity multi-member
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.300]   LLC.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:02.900]   And you make that disregarded entity, the DEM LLC, the beneficiary of the charitable
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.900]   remainder trust.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.900]   Which means the assets flow into that LLC.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:11.840]   The LLC protects those assets with charging order protection from the claims of creditors.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.180]   But yet you don't create a tax problem because you the individual are still receiving, as
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:21.980]   the ultimate tax person, you the individual are still receiving the benefits of that charitable
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.020]   remainder trust.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:28.100]   But those income streams are protected from the claims of creditors if necessary.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:33.100]   I hope you made it with me.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.940]   This series is for mere mortals.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.940]   And so I've been trying to keep everything low hanging.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:41.220]   I didn't want to get into state advanced stuff.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.580]   I love the stuff.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:48.340]   But it's just not applicable to most people, including most listeners of the podcast.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:52.460]   But hopefully it piques your interest of some of the fun things that are available to you
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.380]   when you are wealthy enough to pay the legal fees.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:59.020]   Remember, there are thousands of lawyers that sit around and read the rules and come up
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:01.020]   with all kinds of fun stuff like this.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.540]   And you can have access to them too.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.340]   Just pay the right fees.
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:05.780]   So there's one set of tax code.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.620]   It's just that rich people pay lawyers to read it and figure out how to exploit it.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.260]   Everything we've just talked about is totally legal.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.340]   I'm not sure how much of it has been tested in court.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.620]   I have not studied the court case to see how it has held up.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.620]   But I see no...
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.660]   In my layman's approach, I see no reason why there's a problem.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.540]   I'll let the attorneys argue that out later.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:27.180]   But it should open up to you some of the ideas.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.940]   I just wanted to mention those ideas because they also involve annuities.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:33.740]   I get so sick and tired of people dumping on annuities.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:37.300]   They also involve annuities, but not commercial annuities.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:42.620]   The foreign annuity where we talked about the offshore LLC purchasing the foreign annuity,
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:47.700]   that involved a commercial annuity just from an offshore company, which is important.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.900]   But then this stuff just involves the concept of an annuity, but doesn't involve a commercial
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   annuity.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:57.460]   It just involves an annuity schedule of payments coming out of an irrevocable trust.
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.580]   I hope that's enough to get you thinking.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.920]   Again, we passed through mere mortals, but everything at the beginning of the show was
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   low-hanging fruit.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.820]   Annuities, you can use them yourself.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.340]   The middle stuff, you can do that as you start to build up your offshore plan, as you start
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:15.360]   to go offshore yourself, as you start to accumulate assets offshore.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.620]   Annuities can be very useful there for you.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:22.060]   And then kind of the ultimate, hopefully you enjoyed the final flourish, is you can start
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.060]   to use this to dispose of an estate and to protect a large estate from the claims of
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:30.180]   creditors while also minimizing estate taxes, income taxes, and securing your wealth for
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.340]   future heirs while also making charitable contributions.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:36.380]   Hope you're enjoying this particular series.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.700]   I don't have any closing announcements.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:42.580]   I just encourage you to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com, switch over to the website, a new website.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.500]   It's profoundly simpler than the old one was and profoundly more obvious where you can
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.780]   buy stuff from me.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:48.780]   Go to the store.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.380]   At the moment, there's only one course listed, but if you're listening to this in the future,
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.380]   come on back.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:53.380]   There'll be more there in the future.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:57.660]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com, click on store, buy the credit card course, and then
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.260]   keep an eye out to see what's there.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.460]   More ads coming in the future.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.700]   I'll be back with you very soon.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:07.100]   With Kroger Brand products from Ralphs, you can make all your favorite things this holiday
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:12.580]   season, because Kroger Brand's proven quality products come at exceptionally low prices.
