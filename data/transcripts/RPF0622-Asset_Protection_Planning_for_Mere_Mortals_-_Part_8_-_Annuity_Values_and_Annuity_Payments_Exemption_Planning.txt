[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:51.400]   can think about an annuity in terms of a pot of money and or stream of payment. Usually when talking about annuities, we define an annuity as a stream of payment. A stream of payments that comes into somebody and it often comes in for something approaching life expectancy. In many ways, we talked about annuities is the opposite of life insurance. When you buy a life insurance policy, you make premium payment into that policy until the moment of death. And then when the death claim is filed,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   ÐšÐ¾Ñ€.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:21.420]   and you can give it to an insurance company and they can make out a series of payments that come in each month until the moment of death, at which time the payment stop. So one useful way of thinking about annuities is as a way of disposing of a large amount of money over the course of somebody's lifetime. But of course, there are many times when you can get your money and you can give it to someone else.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.360]  ì£¼
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:50.320]  ell,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   and
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   and
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   and
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   I'll do it.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.620]   renders the corpus, the body of money that's just sitting there.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.880]   And sometimes you don't have to decide in advance what happens with the money.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.640]   You can just simply put the money into an annuity contract.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   Now, on the flip side, you can think about an annuity in terms of a series of payments, a stream of payments.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.680]   You can take that same million dollars to an insurance company.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.060]   You can say, here, insurance company, make payments to me for the rest of my life.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:21.500]   And they'll say, OK, well, based upon your life expectancy, we'll make payments to you of $800 every month.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   We'll make payments to you of $800 every month.

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:51.560]   in the bank but a guaranteed income of $100,000 a year for the rest of his life which is richer should probably adjust those numbers a little bit because a 30 year old couldn't buy a million dollar with a million dollars couldn't buy a hundred thousand dollars a year so let's just say it's you know $60,000 a year which is richer you get the point the point is that you can't answer the question because sometimes the body of money is valuable and sometimes the stream of income is valuable now here's why that's so important when we come to asset protection planning
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   of protecting money for example if you have a million dollars in a bank account and you move that million dollars into an annuity contract and if annuity contracts are exempt from the claims of creditors in your particular state you have effectively protected the million dollars and that can be very helpful in your own
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   you have effectively protected the million dollars and that can be very helpful in your own
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   and that can be very helpful in your own

But you'll be charged a higher expense ratio two point six percent for the first eight years and then it'll change down something something like that. And what's better or worse would depend largely on the contract.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:37.580]  and it also depends on what we're going to happen with your overall plans for the contract. If you choose a contract where the where the commission sales commission is not charged up front. Then you're going to incur a series of surrender fees where if you surrender the contract within a short amount of time a surrender charge will be charged to the contract. Those charges range from reason to reason.

[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   The value of the CRT's corpus is evaluated annually in order to determine the actual dollar amount distributed.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   We'll discuss the NIMCRUT later.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   For a CRT to qualify a charitable remainder trust to qualify as such,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   It must meet the following criteria.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   A CRT must pay at least 5%, but no more than 50% of its initial corpus annually.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   A CRT must pay at least 5%, but no more than 50% of its corpus in accordance with its annual valuation amount.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   At least 10% of the CRT's initial corpus must pass as a remainder.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:23:07.500]   a CRT may last a maximum of 20 years or for the lifetime or lives of the grantors.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:07.500]   When the grantors die, all remaining trust assets must pass to a charity that meets the criteria set forth in section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code. CRTs are ideal for almost anyone who plans to give away some of their estate to charity when they die. This is because a normal charitable gift upon their death only qualifies for an estate tax deduction, wherein the gift is not included in the grantor's taxable estate. However, property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  , but the CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  , but the CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.

[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:07.540]   The CRT's property is not included in the CRT's taxable estate.
