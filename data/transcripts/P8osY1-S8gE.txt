[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I would like to call attention once more to the words that are to be found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.360]   to the Romans in chapter 5 and in verse 5, the fifth verse in the fifth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:24.000]   epistle to the Romans, "And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.480]   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.120]   I say that I call attention to that again, because most of you will remember that we
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.620]   were also dealing with it last Friday evening.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.680]   Then I try to show the connection between this statement, this verse, and the previous
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   verses.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.040]   And it's very important that we should bear that connection in mind.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.220]   The apostle in this paragraph, in this chapter, in these first five verses, is proving and
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.600]   establishing the certainty of our salvation.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   Any man who is justified by faith, and who knows that, is a man who can be certain and
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.920]   assured of his salvation.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   Why?
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.600]   Well, because, as he tells us, he has peace with God.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.700]   He has access into this grace in which he stands, and he bursts and exalts and glories
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.300]   in the hope of that glory which is to come.
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.780]   Not only that, says the apostle, even trials and tribulations, far from shaking the faith
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.260]   of such a man, rarely serve to increase his assurance.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.020]   For, he says, we rejoice also, we glory also in tribulations, merely that we put up with
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700]   them, or manage to go through with them somehow.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.460]   We glory in tribulations.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.900]   In other words, they make our assurance yet more certain.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.180]   And you remember how he works out the argument that tribulation worketh patience, and patience
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.720]   worketh experience, and experience worketh hope.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.260]   And you remember we saw that experience means testing, or proof.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.220]   Thus, the whole time, he is establishing this great certainty and finality and assurance.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.060]   And back it brings him to faith, because proof, this trial, leads back again to the hope,
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.740]   which is greater than ever.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.460]   And then he goes on to this further statement, "And hope maketh not ashamed," which we
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.340]   interpret it as meaning it never fails you, it never lets you down, it never puts you
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340]   to shame.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.180]   Well, how does this work out?
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.500]   Well, he says it is like this, that ultimately our greatest ground of assurance of all is
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.020]   the fact that the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.180]   Now, that was the thing that occupied us last Friday evening.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.900]   To me, one of the most glorious statements in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.460]   We cannot consider anything greater or more wonderful than that.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.060]   I cannot go over it again, much as I am tempted to do so, for the sake of those who are not
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.060]   here.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.700]   But the love of God, we emphasized, is shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140]   We do not deduce it merely from the Scripture or from anything else.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.220]   It is what the Holy Ghost does, it is poured out in a superabundance, there is no question
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220]   about it.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.740]   It is something that we know immediately and directly, not as the result of argument and
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.160]   deduction, but it is the immediate operation.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.320]   We are certain of it, and there is no higher assurance than that.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.740]   If you like, the Spirit testifieth with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.940]   Well, now then, having looked at that, we still come back to the verse.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.960]   Because of this interesting statement that the Apostle makes at the end of this statement,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.380]   he says, "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.420]   is given unto us."
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.420]   Now, it is to that I want, in particular, to call attention tonight.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.280]   Now, I said in passing last week that there are different types of assurance, and that
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.460]   that assurance we were looking at last week is the highest of allâ€”the love of God shed
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.420]   abroad in our hearts.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.180]   There is nothing higher than that, nothing beyond that.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.140]   No Christian has ever had anything that surpasses that, and that is something that is possible
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.100]   to all of us, but which, as I tried to indicate, is not possessed by all of us.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.060]   You can be a Christian without knowing that particular experience.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.900]   But there are other types of assurance, and it is to this other type of assurance in particular
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.420]   that I am calling attention this evening.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.620]   There is an assurance short of that assurance that a man has who knows what it is to have
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.140]   the love of God shed abroad in his heart, in the way that I quoted to you from Henry
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.500]   Venn, etc., and the way in which you will find in the life of a man like George Whitefield,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.420]   to whom I have just been referring, and in the experience of a man like Jonathan Edwards.
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.780]   They described this love of God shed abroad in their hearts, how it seemed to come in
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.080]   wave after wave, and they were melted unto the glory of it all, and almost felt their
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.940]   physical frames collapsing.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.660]   Now, there is, I say, an assurance short of that.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.980]   It is an assurance, but it is not that.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.480]   That is the supreme, the final assurance.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.180]   But there is this other assurance that we enjoy, and should enjoy, which is short of
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.180]   that.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.940]   And that is the one that is introduced by this expression, "the Holy Spirit which
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.420]   is given unto us."
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:05.460]   Now, this is, therefore, a very important addition to what we were saying last Friday
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   night.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.060]   Now, this must not be regarded as just a statement in and of itself.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.860]   It is, I am emphasizing, a part of the Apostle's whole argument in this section.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.500]   It is a part of his argument with regard to this certainty of salvation.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:34.460]   The man who knows what it is to be justified by faith should have assurance of salvation.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.700]   That is the whole argument here.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.220]   If we only understand it truly, he says, "Well, you must have assurance."
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.140]   Now, this is a part of that great argument.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:52.700]   Now, as we come and look at it, I cannot but turn aside for a moment to indicate again
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:05.220]   and to show you the great Apostle's method, the way his mind proceeds in logical steps.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:12.100]   Now, what he does here is something that he does so frequently.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.980]   He first of all makes a number of statements, and he has been doing that in these first
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.980]   five verses.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.820]   Then, having done that, he takes them up in particular.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.860]   We shall find, when we come to verse 6, God willing, that he takes up particularly the
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.700]   love of God, which is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.620]   Then, he will deal with that from verse 6 to verse 11.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.300]   But here, you see, he introduces the doctrine of the Holy Spirit for the first time in this
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.820]   great epistle.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.020]   And we shall find that he does not come back and deal with that really fully until you
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.820]   get to chapter 8.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.980]   Why am I troubling to say this?
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.540]   Well, I am troubling to say that for this reason, that it is because so many people
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.260]   forget that, forget that he really introduces it here in chapter 5 in verse 5, that they
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.540]   go wrong in their interpretation of chapters 7 and 8.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.820]   They are so fond of saying, "The Holy Spirit is not mentioned until chapter 8."
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.820]   He is.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.660]   He is mentioned back here, and Paul simply takes it up again and elaborates it and explains
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.520]   it fully in chapter 8.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.820]   But here it is introduced, and we must never forget that.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.740]   You see, he makes a comprehensive statement, then he takes up one of them, works it out,
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.820]   takes up another, works it out, then he takes up another and works it out.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.220]   But here, in these five verses, we really have it all, this absolute certainty.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.700]   You see, he jumps from justification to glorification, as I have already shown you, and he will do
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.580]   that again in chapter 8.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.580]   And we must never forget that.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.060]   These things are not discrete and separate.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.220]   They all belong together, they are all interlinked, and that indeed is, as I understand it, the
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:07.620]   whole point and purport of his argument at this particular point in this epistle.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:14.340]   Very well then, let us just remember that in passing and note his method, and note particularly
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.240]   that here he does introduce us to his doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.840]   And why does he do it here?
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.340]   Why did he add this?
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:30.980]   Well, because it is an essential part of the whole statement about certainty and assurance
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.700]   of salvation.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.140]   His statement would not have been complete if he had not added this, which we are now
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.100]   going to consider, about the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.180]   Now then, let us look at it.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.180]   What does he say?
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.060]   Well, I have tried to divide it up like this.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:55.060]   First, the Holy Spirit is given to all Christians, without exception.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.260]   The Holy Spirit is given to all Christians.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.780]   Now we needn't stay with this, let me give you just one proof of it, which we shall find
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.180]   in this very epistle, in the eighth chapter and in the ninth verse, where he says at the
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:18.060]   end, "Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.260]   You cannot be a Christian without having received the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.980]   There is no question about that, there it is.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.740]   It is impossible, it is inconceivable.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:39.340]   Every Christian is one to whom the Holy Spirit has been given.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:50.780]   Now that means that the Holy Spirit dwells within every Christian.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:57.340]   This is a most amazing and astounding doctrine, but it is a part of the New Testament teaching.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.540]   Here it is again in that eighth chapter, take verse nine, "But you are not in the flesh,
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:08.580]   but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.060]   Then our statement, "Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.300]   Then, "And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.940]   because of righteousness."
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:29.100]   But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, that is it.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.620]   We are not concerned about the rest of that verse this evening, but we are concerned about
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.620]   that.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.300]   That the Holy Spirit we must not think of merely as an influence upon us.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.460]   When the Scripture says the Holy Spirit has been given to us, the Scripture means that
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.540]   the Holy Spirit dwells within us.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.340]   That was the promise of our Lord, wasn't it?
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:00.900]   You will find it in the fourteenth chapter of John, "He is with you and shall be in you."
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.180]   I don't want to overemphasize that, but I think it is there.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.700]   Then, of course, we have a still more specific statement with regard to it in the first epistle
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:16.020]   to the Corinthians in chapter 6 and verses 19 and 20, particularly verse 19.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:25.100]   What he says, "Know ye will not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:32.260]   is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own."
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.580]   Now, that is, of course, as specific and as explicit as anything can be.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:50.460]   "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.660]   have of God."
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:13:00.420]   Now, go home and read the context and you will see how vitally important it is.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.300]   Surely there is no teaching which should so help us in our striving and fighting against
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:12.420]   sin and temptation as this doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.420]   The apostle in that chapter is dealing with the sin of fornication, and that is how he
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   deals with it.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.660]   He doesn't just say the thing is wrong in and of itself.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   This is the argument.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:27.780]   "Don't you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost who dwells in you?"
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.820]   Well, he says, "Remember that and realize the implications of that."
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:38.180]   That is his method of teaching sanctification and the way to resist sin.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.260]   But I am emphasizing now that this is what is meant by the Holy Spirit that is given
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.980]   to you.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:52.180]   It is just a statement that the Holy Ghost dwells within us, in our bodies.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.180]   Don't try to understand it.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.460]   Who can understand it?
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.020]   Who can understand this teaching about the Holy Spirit dwelling within us, in our bodies,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.780]   tabernacling within us?
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.460]   Who can understand our Lord's statement when he says that he and his Father will come and
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.460]   take up their abode within us?
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.460]   But there it is.
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.740]   Who can understand what he means in Revelations 3.20, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock."
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:25.260]   Addressing Christians, addressing a church, "If any man open, I will come in and take
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.860]   up his abode and sup with us."
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.540]   Now, there it is.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:36.640]   But this is the teaching that the Holy Ghost dwells within us, and in our bodies.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.780]   Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:48.580]   Well now, obviously, this is a vital matter in regard to this whole question of assurance.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:58.140]   So I take as my second principle, how his being given to us is a guarantee of the finality
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.060]   of our salvation.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   That is the Apostle's object, that is what he is concerned to show, and therefore we
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.700]   must take it up.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:12.220]   He has been given like this, well now, how does that prove and establish the certainty
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.820]   of our salvation?
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:20.980]   Well, the answers to that, of course, are many, but let me pick out some.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:31.140]   Here is one, surely, that is in itself proof positive that God has started to work in us,
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.900]   that he is concerned about us.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.540]   And you see the rest of that argument.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   It's Philippians 1.6 again, "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.220]   the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.220]   Oh, there's nothing more sure than that, there's nothing more wonderful.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:59.580]   "How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.580]   word."
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.900]   It's this sort of thing.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.100]   If the Holy Ghost is in you, well, you know that God is concerned about you, he started
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.340]   working in you.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:15.420]   And if God starts, God will continue.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.860]   God never begins a work and drops it.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.620]   As certainly as God begins, he continues, he will end.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.620]   It's an absolute certainty.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.220]   Very well then, sir, we draw that deduction.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:37.680]   And then, in the same way, of course, this is the proof of our rebirth.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.980]   This is the work of the Spirit, and you cannot say of a man that the Holy Spirit dwells within
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.100]   him unless he has been born again, unless he has this new nature.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:59.480]   There is no receptacle in the natural man to receive the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.380]   It is only the new nature that can receive him.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.700]   That is why he does this work of regeneration, that he may come and dwell within us.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.420]   Now, I've got to divide these things thus in thought, there is no division in time with
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.860]   regard to that particular matter, but we have to divide it in thought in order to get our
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.620]   conceptions clear.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:28.900]   So the fact that he is in us is a proof of regeneration, and again, if we are given this
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:39.800]   new principle of life, if we are born of the Spirit, it is a guarantee of our final perfection.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.100]   It is inconceivable that this work of God in the soul should suddenly vanish and disappear
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100]   and be destroyed.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.540]   You cannot fall from grace.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.900]   What a monstrous doctrine that is, that a man can be a Christian one day, then he falls
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:00.260]   into sin, he is no longer a Christian, then he again becomes a Christian.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.620]   You see, people who talk like that don't consider regeneration as they should.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.960]   If they thought of it in terms of regeneration, they'd see how impossible it is.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.920]   The regenerate man may backslide, yes, but he is still a child, he is still a partaker
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.840]   of the divine nature, the seed is still in him, and always will be in him.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.040]   It cannot disappear.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.740]   Very well then, I say, what a powerful argument that is also, and how we should emphasize
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:36.320]   that aspect of regeneration rather than our believing and simply our holding on.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.000]   It is this work of God that guarantees it, and the Holy Spirit within is a guarantee
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   of that.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.520]   Or I may put that in another way by putting it like this.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.640]   The presence of the Holy Spirit within us is a guarantee in another respect that we
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:19:00.040]   shall continue and be kept in the faith and in touch with God.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:06.560]   I find that, for instance, in Philippians 2, 12 and 13, "Work out your own salvation,"
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:13.360]   says the Apostle, "with fear and trembling, for, because it is God that worketh in you
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.600]   both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.200]   Now, let's have a look at that.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   What does it mean?
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.520]   Well, I think it means something like this.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   There are so many people who emphasize so much our activity and our choice and our decision
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.760]   and so on, and then they say, "Ah, yes, you may do that one day," and then, of course,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   you get entangled in the world and other people and so on and other interests, and you forget
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.160]   all about it, and you lose what you've had and so on.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.920]   That isn't the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.560]   If we were left to ourselves, of course, we'd all be hopeless.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   If God just did something to us and then left the remainder to us, how could any man be
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.080]   sure of his salvation?
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.960]   We are all lazy, we are all forgetful, we are all indolent, we are all influenced by
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.240]   the world, we are all weak, and we are all very frail.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.320]   What guarantee have I got that I'll go on and that ultimately I'll stand before God
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   perfect?
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.980]   Well, it's this, the Holy Spirit within me.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:25.100]   He acts and he works in me both to will and to do.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:32.700]   In other words, he influences me, he pulls me up, he upbraids me, he gives me a taste
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.060]   for the Word, a desire for it.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.540]   He influences me in these odd ways.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.500]   In my very willing, he's at the back of my willing.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.780]   It is God, through the Holy Spirit, that worketh in you both to will and to do.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.620]   And haven't we all experienced this?
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:59.060]   How suddenly, perhaps, after a dry and an arid period in the history of the soul, or
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:05.020]   when perhaps you've even been in sin and have become forgetful, suddenly you're reminded
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.460]   of something.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.860]   Suddenly a verse comes back.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.420]   Suddenly a verse of a hymn comes back, or something.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   What is this?
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.780]   Ah, that's the operation of the Holy Spirit that is in you.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.380]   He's working within us, both to will, he creates the desires, he's right at the back
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.060]   of all this willing and all this desiring.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.100]   And thus, you see, the fact that the Holy Spirit is in me is a guarantee that I'll
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   be kept in touch, that I'll go on.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.860]   Oh, what a wonderful thing this is.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:45.420]   It isn't I, it isn't my faithfulness, it isn't my frail grasp and hold on him.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.100]   It is his mighty grasp of me.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.820]   And he does this and keeps the grasp, as it were, through the work and the operation of
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   the Holy Spirit whom he has put within us.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:03.900]   And there he is the whole time, as Paul will outline again for us in the eighth chapter.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.940]   We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit maketh intercession for us
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.660]   with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:17.300]   We don't quite understand what we are saying, but he does, and he works these prayers within
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   us.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:25.340]   Well, it goes on endlessly in that way, but come, let's look at it in another way.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.660]   He guarantees our growth also.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.500]   These things are virtually all the same thing, but it gives me great comfort and encouragement
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.700]   to look from different aspects.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.340]   He guarantees my growth, but I shan't remain stunted.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.060]   Well, how does he do this?
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.380]   Well, he does it, of course, by revealing the truth.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.620]   "We have received," says the apostle to the Corinthians, "not the Spirit that is of the
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:58.740]   world, but the Spirit that is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.900]   to us of God."
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.900]   What are these things?
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.780]   Well, they are the things which the natural man does not receive because they are foolishness
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.420]   unto him, but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   The princes of the world don't understand it, but God hath revealed them unto us, and
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.860]   he goes on revealing them.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:21.460]   He opens them out, he leads us on, and he likewise enlightens our mind.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:27.700]   That is why you find this apostle praying so constantly something like this as he prays
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.620]   for the Ephesians.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:36.340]   He says, "I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.820]   the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:49.460]   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, the eyes of your understanding being
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.180]   enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and the riches of the
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.820]   glory of his inheritance in the saints, and the exceeding greatness of his power to us
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.460]   would that believe, etc."
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:06.100]   Now you see, the Holy Spirit does all this, and thus he is a guarantee of our growth and
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.420]   development.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:14.420]   It is he who enables us to understand, who take John saying it in his first epistle in
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:20.100]   chapter 2, "You have that unction," he says, "that anointing from the Holy One."
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.500]   He teaches you.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.060]   He gives you this discrimination and this understanding.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.500]   Look at John there writing to those early Christians, he is an old man, he is about
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   to leave them.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.380]   How can he be so happy about them with these antichrists?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.820]   That is his answer, "You have an anointing, you have this unction, and you have no need
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:46.700]   that any man teach you, but the anointing which you have received will keep you."
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:52.700]   What a wonderful source this is of assurance and of certainty.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:58.900]   God gives us his Spirit and the Spirit dwells within us to guarantee our growth and our
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   development.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:10.420]   But finally, the dwelling of the Holy Ghost within us is a guarantee of our becoming finally
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:16.740]   fit to enter into that glory that he has prepared for us.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.340]   The apostle you see here has mentioned it at the beginning of the chapter.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.900]   It is the third of the things that I emphasize that are inevitable if we truly know what
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.900]   it is to be justified by faith.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:36.660]   The third thing you remember was, "We glory in hope of the glory of God."
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:42.260]   We boast in hope of the glory of God.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:55.140]   No, there it is by faith we see it, but here we know that we shall arrive there.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:03.040]   Have you ever thought of it in this way, the glory of God?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:11.380]   We shall see Christ as he is, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.260]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.700]   Who shall dwell with that burning light?
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.380]   Who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord?
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:29.980]   What hope have we got of ever getting there and seeing him and entering into that glory
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.820]   and living in that realm where there is no sin and none of the things which surround
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.180]   us in such profusion in this present world?
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:45.860]   We are told that nothing dark or impure or unclean shall enter in without our dogs and
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.300]   sorcerers and adulterers and so on, that utter absolute purity.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.420]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.500]   How can you or I or anybody ever get there?
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:06.420]   How can we glory and exult and boast of this hope of the glory of God?
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.940]   Well, there is only one answer.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:20.900]   It is because the Holy Spirit is in us and it is his peculiar work to sanctify us, to
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.900]   rid us of sin.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.780]   "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth."
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.620]   Yes, the Holy Spirit does that.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:34.080]   He is the great sanctifier and he purifies and he cleanses and he purges.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:42.100]   He has his methods and his ways and we can be certain that eventually we shall stand
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:49.940]   in the presence of God faultless and blameless without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:57.620]   And I know and my only way of knowing for certain that I shall arrive there is the fact
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:03.220]   that the Holy Spirit has been given to me and is in me.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.460]   Oh yes, the apostle is dealing here with assurance.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.940]   We must never take this fifth verse out of its context.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:17.520]   It is a part of the great argument about assurance and it is in some such way that this assurance
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.820]   is made possible to us.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.820]   But now let me be very practical.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:34.100]   Let me, in the third place, my third principle, consider with you this question.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:39.740]   How then may we know that the Holy Spirit has been given to us?
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.300]   I say the man who does know this has got that assurance in the ways I have been indicating.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:52.540]   So the immediate practical question is this, how may we know that the Holy Spirit has been
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540]   given to us?
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.580]   Well, it is a very large subject.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.380]   I can only give you some headings.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.020]   You must work them out for yourselves.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:07.740]   Here is one, the statement that you will find in 1 Corinthians 12 and in the third verse.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.620]   You remember it?
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.180]   The apostle is dealing again with the gifts of the Spirit but before coming to that he
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:21.540]   says this, "Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:33.820]   calleth Jesus accursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.960]   Ghost."
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:42.980]   No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.380]   If he has not got the Holy Ghost he cannot say that.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.620]   Now then, what does that mean?
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:54.980]   Well obviously it does not just mean uttering the words that Jesus is the Lord.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.780]   Anybody can utter the words, it patently does not mean that.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.780]   What does it mean then?
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.460]   Well, this is really the full Christian confession.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.660]   And when I say the full Christian confession I mean this.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:15.540]   The man who says Jesus is the Lord is a man who is making certain statements about his
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.900]   person.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:26.580]   He is saying that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and the Lord of glory.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:32.420]   He is a man who is committing himself to the doctrine of the incarnation and of the person
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.740]   of Christ.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.280]   He is saying in him there are two natures but only one person.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:45.840]   He is asserting yes he is fully, eternally God but he is fully man, truly God, truly
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   man.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   Two natures, one person, unmixed, one person.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   He is saying that.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:58.440]   That is a part of what is meant by saying that Jesus is Lord.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:06.320]   He believes in all we are told in the Scripture of what happened at Bethlehem on that occasion
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:14.180]   when that babe was born and that this is none other than the eternal Son of God, born of
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:22.000]   the Virgin, conceived of the Holy Ghost, the uniqueness, the glory, the marvel, the wonder
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.360]   of his person.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.800]   That is a part of that confession.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.280]   But it does not stop at the person.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.160]   It also includes his work.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.200]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   In what way?
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.640]   Well, he is the Lord of the universe.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.720]   He is the Word through whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made that
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   was made.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.320]   Oh, yes, but it means more.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.920]   It has a reference to the work that he accomplished when he was here on earth.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.480]   He is the Lord in this sense.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.840]   Keep that quotation I gave you just now of 1 Corinthians 6, "Know ye not that your
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.120]   bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in you, and ye are not your own?"
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   Why?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.480]   "For ye have been bought with a price."
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.960]   He is my Lord because he has bought me, he has ransomed me, he has paid the price of
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.200]   my deliverance.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.880]   I was a slave of sin.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.040]   He has bought me out.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.280]   I belong to him.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.080]   Paul describes himself as the bond slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   He is the Lord, Paul is the slave.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.680]   And the man who says that Jesus is Lord is saying that.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:43.880]   He is confessing that he has died for him and for his sins, that he has purchased his
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.840]   pardon at the cost of his own blood.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.640]   No man can say that without the Holy Ghost.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.200]   The man of the world does not believe it.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.720]   He does not believe in the person.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.320]   The princes of this world did not know him, for had they known him they would not have
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.480]   crucified the Lord of Glory, and they ridicule the atonement and his sacrificial death upon
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   the cross.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.720]   They dismiss it with contemnation, they ridicule it.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   Why?
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.960]   They have not received the Spirit.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.640]   No man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.400]   The natural man receives not the things, there it is again, their foolishness unto him, neither
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   can he.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.400]   Why?
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.360]   Because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.600]   The Spirit alone enables a man to do this.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:34.240]   My friends, do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:39.280]   Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God?
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.880]   And that he died for your sins on Calvary's hill?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.120]   And that because he did so, God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name that is
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.740]   above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:34:00.560]   and things on earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   God the Father.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.520]   That is the content of saying that Jesus is Lord.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.200]   It is one of the fullest statements you can ever make.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:16.600]   It includes the whole doctrine of the person and his work, his life, his death, his burial,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.160]   his resurrection, his ascension, his exaltation.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:30.240]   He is Lord of all, because, wherefore God hath highly exalted him?
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.080]   Because he humbled himself unto death, yea, even the death of the cross.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.640]   Oh, my dear friend, I must hold you with this for a moment.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.400]   I am saying, do you want to know that the Holy Spirit has been given to you?
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.920]   Well, that is the way you know it.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.600]   Do you believe these things?
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.440]   Are these things the most vital things in your life?
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   Do you know that you are a hopeless, damned, and condemned sinner, and that though you
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.840]   turn over new leaves and try to live a good life, and indulge in good works, you will
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.440]   never be a Christian, and never make yourself fit to see the glory of God?
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.200]   That your only hope of ever getting there is that Christ came down from heaven and took
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.880]   your sins and died for you, and bore your punishment on the cross, on Calvary's hill,
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.000]   and rose again to justify the whole thing Paul is talking about here, justification
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.800]   by faith only, that he justifies the ungodly, he justifies the sinner, that it is all because
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   of Christ and his sacrificial atoning work upon the cross for us.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.600]   Do you believe that?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.160]   Is that the thing you are trusting to?
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.360]   Have you given up trusting to yourself and your good works and all your good thoughts
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.840]   and all your good deeds?
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:58.040]   Have you finished with all that and say, "I have nothing but Christ"?
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:06.720]   Can you say my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness?
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:18.880]   I dare not trust my sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name, on Christ the solid
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.280]   rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.680]   If you can say that, the Holy Ghost is in you.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:35.400]   No man can say that unless the Holy Spirit is in him and has been given to him by God.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.720]   It is an absolute proof, can you say it?
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.480]   Make certain of it.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.880]   But then there are other things, I merely note them.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:47.160]   Take all the tests of that first epistle of John, read it for yourselves, go through.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.440]   Again, belief on him.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.560]   This is how we know that we believe in him, says John, because of the spirit that he has
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   given us.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.320]   Did you notice that last verse of that fourth chapter of the first epistle of John that
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.240]   I read to you at the beginning?
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.880]   The last verse of the third chapter, "And hereby we know that he abideth in us by the
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.080]   spirit which he hath given us."
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.900]   There it is.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:21.640]   But not only that, we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:27.960]   If you can say honestly tonight that you would sooner be here in the company of God's people
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.280]   than in the greatest palace on earth and with the greatest earthly person, I tell you, you
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.120]   have got the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:43.360]   Because the world despises us and is not interested in us and regards us as fools.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.520]   But if you love the brethren, you can be certain that the Holy Spirit has been given to you
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.840]   and is in you.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.240]   If you like the fellowship and the conversation of the saints, if you like talking about your
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:59.600]   soul and salvation and God and Christ and heaven and the glory that is coming, I tell
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.320]   you, the Holy Ghost is in you.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.920]   You would not be like that otherwise.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.280]   What about his commandments?
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   John says that if the Holy Spirit is in us, his commandments are not grievous unto us.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.400]   They are very grievous to the men of the world.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.680]   He says, "Your Christianity is very narrow.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.400]   It prohibits this and that and I like them and I want them."
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.240]   The Christian says his commandments are not grievous.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.400]   He agrees with them.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   Why?
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.200]   Well, because he has got a spirit within him that makes him hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.040]   He wants to be holy and clean and pure.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.640]   If you do, the Holy Spirit is in you.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.240]   Do you long to know the Lord Jesus Christ better?
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   Do you long to love him more?
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   If you do, I tell you again, the Holy Spirit is in you.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.320]   I do not care how feeble your love is and how feeble your desires are.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:00.640]   I quote to you again one of my favorite quotations from Blaise Pascal who said, "Thou wouldst
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.800]   not be seeking him unless thou hadst already found him."
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.480]   A man who wants Christ, I say, is a man who has Christ.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.640]   The very fact that you want him is a proof of the spirit within you.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   The other man does not want him.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.040]   He is at enmity against God and at enmity against Christ.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.840]   Apply the tests of the first epistle of John and then apply to yourself the test of the
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.080]   fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.440]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, faith,
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.120]   gentleness, and temperance.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   Are they in you?
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.360]   Are they manifested at all?
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   If they are there, I say, it is good presumptive evidence that the Holy Spirit is in you, the
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.720]   fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.960]   I wanted to say these things before we broke for the next three weeks of a Christmas.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.320]   I should be grieved that anybody should go out of this service uncertain as to whether
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.720]   he is a Christian, as to whether the Holy Spirit is in him.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   We are meant to enjoy these things.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.440]   We are meant to be enjoying peace with God.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.300]   We are meant to be enjoying the grace of God and standing in it.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:19.440]   We are meant to be bursting in anticipation of the glory of God to which we are going.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.560]   We must know these things and be certain of them.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.280]   These are the ways, if the Spirit is in you, He will bring you more and more to assurance,
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.840]   and that is how you know whether the Spirit is in you and whether the Spirit has been
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.000]   given unto you.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.680]   Make certain, my friends.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:40.560]   Well, shall I add just one word before I let you go?
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.600]   These five verses are very wonderful, aren't they?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   They are marvellous.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.000]   Do you see what they have been telling us?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.720]   They have been telling us that the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity are interested
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.860]   in us and interested in our salvation.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:02.240]   We have peace with God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ, and though the Holy
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.280]   Ghost is given unto us.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:13.360]   Shame on us Christian people for being lethargic and cold and lifeless and lacking in joy as
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   we are.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:22.000]   Why don't we realise that the three blessed persons in the blessed Holy Trinity are interested
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.360]   in us and are concerned about us and have done something in order to rescue us and redeem
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.240]   us and to bring us into the family?
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.920]   God the Father planned it.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.000]   He sent the Son to do it.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   He came on that first Christmas day, if you like.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.560]   He did all He did.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   He went back, the Son, His glorious work, and now the Spirit is given and is within
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.520]   us in order to keep us and prepare us for the glory that is coming.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.560]   The three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity are engaged in the work and are concerned
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.040]   about us and are active in our salvation.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:11.680]   Oh, how we should prostrate ourselves before God and issue our humble praise and adoration
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.820]   and worship.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.680]   And my last word is this.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:23.160]   The five verses remind us, don't they, of the basic importance of faith.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.800]   All this comes out of justification by faith only.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:35.440]   Having been justified by faith, we have all these things.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.200]   Faith is the foundation.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.000]   Faith leads to hope.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   What is faith?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.400]   It is the substance of things hoped for, the substantiating of things not seen.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   Faith produces hope, and the more clearly we have that hope, the more we shall know
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:10.040]   the love of God to us, and the more, in turn, we shall love God.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:15.720]   You see, there are three things here on both sidesâ€”God the Father, God the Son, God the
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:25.360]   Holy Spirit, and in me, faith, hope, love.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:31.760]   And the greatest of these is love.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.320]   Is this faith in you?
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.720]   Have you got this hope?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   Is there just a flicker, if no more, of love in your heart for God the Father, God the
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:57.000]   Son, and God the Holy Spirit, who have done so much for you?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.600]   Amen.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:10.760]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy presence to offer our praise and our thanksgiving.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   We would offer our love, unworthy as it is, and we would say with him of old who said,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:25.360]   "Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint, yet I love thee and
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:31.680]   adore thee, O for grace to love thee more.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:42.040]   O God, manifest thyself to us, shed thy love abroad in our hearts, that we may be filled
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.360]   to overflowing and may love thee as we ought.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.760]   O Lord, go with us, follow us, we pray thee.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:45:00.280]   That we all may rejoice in this great and glorious salvation and reveal and manifest
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:08.200]   our glorying and joy to others, not only with our lips but in our lives and in the whole
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   of our department.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.920]   Be with us, O God, and all who are dear to us.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.120]   Be with us until we shall meet thus again.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.160]   Bless us, every one of us, O God, in the days that lie ahead and use us in our respective
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   spheres.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:31.000]   To the glory of thy name, grant that all who meet us and who come into contact with us
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.600]   shall see this uniqueness, this separateness in us and about us, because thou hast made
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:45.760]   us thy children and because thy Spirit is within us.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:53.240]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:00.320]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:08.120]   the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.920]   shall be in glory.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.560]   Amen.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
