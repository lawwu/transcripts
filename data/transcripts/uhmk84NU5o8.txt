[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   in the 84th Psalm, looking particularly at verses 5, 6 and 7. Psalm 84, verses 5, 6 and
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.880]   7. "Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are the ways of them,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.040]   who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.680]   They go from strength to strength; every one of them in Zion appeareth before God." We
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.480]   are in other words continuing our study and consideration of this great psalm, in which
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:02.040]   this meant, and undoubtedly it was King David himself, the evidence internal and external
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.760]   suggests that very strongly, and probably it was a psalm written by him at the time
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.000]   of the rebellion and the insurrection of his own son Absalom, when David, you remember,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.960]   thus suddenly taken unawares, had to escape for his life. And there are graphic accounts
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.880]   of the whole incident in some of the historical books of the Old Testament, how he literally
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.280]   had to flee for his life and found himself wandering through a wilderness, and wondering
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560]   what was going to happen to him and what his future was going to be. Well now, his whole
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.440]   object in writing the psalm, as we have been seeing, has been just to report the fact that
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.640]   to him nothing matters so much in this life and in this world as true religion. It is
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.000]   a psalm which has been written to celebrate the glories and the wonders and the benefits
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.760]   of the truly religious life. He keeps on saying it, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.160]   of hosts." That's how he begins. You remember how he ends? "O Lord of hosts, blessed is
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:30.000]   the man that trusteth in thee." And in between, he has said it many times. That, I say, is
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   his one great theme. That's the thing that he really is setting out to say. And he does
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.640]   it, of course, in order that he may encourage others to realize the importance of a life
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.720]   truly lived under God, and under God's blessing and benediction.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.760]   Now we have seen how the psalmist is very careful to define what he means by true religion,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.400]   because there are false notions current as to what is meant by religion. We all tend
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.960]   to think that we know what religion is by instinct. But when you bring those various
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.840]   ideas and hold them in the light of the biblical teaching, you discover at once how far they
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.400]   are from what is described here, and how many of them are entirely erroneous, and are indeed
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.080]   the very exact opposite of what we have here revealed. So he starts with that. And he lets
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   us know at once that the essence of true religion is to know God. That is the whole of religion,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.280]   to know God. Not to know things about him. That comes in. Not to have certain views of
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.640]   life. That comes in. The essence of religion is really and truly to know God, so that you
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:02.040]   can address him as this man does, and say, "My King and my God." You see, he tells us
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.560]   that his heart and his flesh cry out for the living God. "My soul, longeth ye, even fainteth
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.400]   for the courts of the Lord." There's nothing, he says, that matters, finally, save this.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.160]   Now, this is the essence of true religion. It isn't just a matter of morality. It is
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.000]   that. That's included. But to make that the end of religion, the chief thing in religion,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.480]   is to rob religion of its central glory. It's to know God. He's told us this. He's also
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.800]   taken the precaution of telling us where and how exactly and only God can be known. And
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.200]   he says the place where he is known is at his altars. "Yea, the sparrow hath found an
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.080]   house and the swallow a rest for herself, where she may lay her young." Where is it?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   "Even thine altars, O Lord of hosts." I must start with this, my dear friends. It's no
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   use going on to consider the benefits of Christianity unless you know something about Christ. It's
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.200]   at the altars that God is known. Yes, the altar of sacrifice. There is no knowledge
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   of God except in Jesus Christ and him crucified. He is the sacrifice that is placed upon the
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.080]   altar. "He hath made his soul an offering for sin." "No man," he says himself, "cometh
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.440]   unto the Father, but by me." "I am the way, the truth, and the life." "No man cometh
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   unto the Father, but by me." But by him we can come. Very well, he's told us all about
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.320]   this. And then, having thus laid down these fundamental and essential principles, without
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.240]   which I say there is no point in proceeding, he has gone on to describe to us something
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.440]   of the benefits and the blessings that ensue upon this knowledge of God and being in this
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   place and position where God can bless us. Now, last Sunday night we considered one of
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.320]   these things. And incidentally, let me remind you of the fact that there is nothing that
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   is so remarkable about this particular psalm as the way in which the psalmist uses his
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.480]   images and pictures and his analogies. He was a poet, of course, and the poet generally
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.240]   puts his truths in the form of pictures. He uses symbols, and this man was a poet, the
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.400]   sweet singer of Israel. And you remember that last Sunday night we found him comparing himself
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:48.080]   to a sparrow and to a swallow. And we saw, you remember, that he did that in order to
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.440]   tell us that the first and one of the greatest and the most blessed results of true religion
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:05.240]   and knowledge of God in Christ is that we are given a place of rest. We find a sanctuary.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:15.840]   We find a place of safety, a place of peace and of protection. And above all, we find
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.880]   that place where we can lay our young, where the most priceless and precious thing that
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.200]   we have can be put in safety. Oh, the chief thing about Christianity is that it safeguards
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.360]   the soul. This thing which, according to our Lord, is more precious than the whole world.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.760]   What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Oh,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.480]   the precious character of the soul. Well, here is a place where you can leave it. Leave
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   it in the safekeeping of the strong arm of the Son of God, and it'll be kept forever.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.920]   Lay your young there. Very well. There is our first picture. But now this evening we
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.120]   come on to another picture. And I think the order in which the psalmist puts these things
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.040]   is not without significance. I have a feeling that this is still the right order, so we
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.200]   come in these verses that we are looking at tonight to the second thing. What's this?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.040]   What's the second great boon and blessing that Christianity confers upon us? Well, to
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   put it in the form of a principle, it is this. It brings order into our lives. Where do you
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   find that, Sir Sumner? Well, listen again. "Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee."
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.000]   That's his secret, you see. He keeps on repeating that. The secret of this man is that his strength
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.760]   is in God. Not in himself, in God. He's realized that God is the Lord of hosts, and he's discovered
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.000]   him at the altar. He's found the way to him. His strength is in God. Very well. But then
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.600]   this is what follows. "Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:08.360]   are ways." Now, I read to you here the authorized translation, and of course, these men, they've
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.440]   added certain words that are not in the original. I read here, "Blessed is the man whose strength
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.760]   is in thee, in whose heart are the ways of them." But there's nothing in the original
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.960]   about "of them." What the psalmist wrote was just this. "Blessed is the man whose
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.560]   strength is in thee, in whose heart are ways." And what does he mean by ways? Well, the very
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   word he used means this. A made road. A road that has been made deliberately. That's
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   the true meaning of this word, "ways." "Blessed is the man who has made roads, constructed
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.080]   thoroughfares in his heart." Very well. Now then, here we see that the psalmist is
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:08.040]   employing another very graphic picture. What does he mean? What is his teaching? Well,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.920]   I'm putting it in this way as a principle, that one of the leading results of the Christian
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:23.400]   faith is that it brings order into our lives. Let's follow him and use his picture. "The
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.880]   heart of the man who is not a Christian, the heart of the religious person, the irreligious
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:43.040]   person, is like a pathless wilderness." Now, you may have read of settlers in early
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.520]   years in the United States or in Canada or some other land that has only been discovered
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.240]   in the last few centuries, and you may have read descriptions of how when the settlers
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:01.400]   first arrived and landed, they found nothing but a kind of endless bush, same in Australia.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:09.960]   There it was, a virgin soil, a virgin country. No roads, no pathways, trees and shrubs, and
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.080]   all manner of herbs growing, and it was impossible to work your way through a kind of wilderness
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.040]   with a jungle, and it was almost impossible to move. They could only move a few steps
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.680]   at a time, and they had to beat a path out for themselves. Now, that's the kind of picture
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.920]   that the Psalmist very clearly has in his mind. The heart of the irreligious person,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:41.560]   the heart of the man who is not a Christian, is a kind of pathless wilderness. It's uncharted.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:48.200]   It's never been cleared. There are no paths there, there are no roads, there are no highways,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:54.720]   it hasn't been mapped out. Everything is tangled up and mixed up, and when you look
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:03.400]   at it, you can't see where you can go in any direction whatsoever. Not only that, there
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:11.520]   are all these ups and downs, high hills and deep valleys. The whole thing is in a kind
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   of natural state, and it's quite uncharted, and it's never been prospected, and the whole
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:29.600]   thing is in a state of utter confusion. Now, the Psalmist says that by way of contrast,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.360]   and it's very important that we should understand his teaching, because his teaching is nothing
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   but an accurate description in detail of what we all are by nature in this life and in this
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.240]   world as the result of the fall, and as the result of the sin of the first men. Our lives,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:58.020]   I say, as they are untouched by the power of God, are simply like a pathless wilderness.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:05.720]   What do I mean? Well, I mean something like this, that the natural men, the men who is
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:13.800]   not a Christian, rarely has no view or philosophy of life. That is the trouble with men and
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:22.360]   women who are outside the life of God. They've got no clear ideas. They've never really thought
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.680]   it out. It is, I say, like this great territory which hasn't been mapped out, which hasn't
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.720]   been chartered, and the great roads have not been run through it. It's just a hopeless
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:42.320]   tangle. Everything's mixed up, and there's no rhyme nor reason. Everything is taken for
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:51.440]   granted. There is no order or system at all in their lives. Am I being unfair? Well, I
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   just ask you, if you're not a Christian, to look into your own mind, or I ask you to talk
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   to others, I ask you to read biographies, and you'll find that this is undoubtedly
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.120]   the case. They may adopt some temporary view, but the vast majority don't even seem to
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:14.000]   do that. Life is just taken for granted, and men and women live from hand to mouth and
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.360]   from day to day. There's no scheme, there's no system, there's no understanding in their
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.560]   lives, to use the words of Matthew Arnold. They've never seen life steadily, they've
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:34.480]   never seen it whole. It's quite uncharted. In the same way, we can say of it that there
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:44.640]   is no plan in it and no purpose. The life of so many today is entirely aimless. They
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.720]   don't really live, they just exist. They don't sit down and say, "Well, now then, what am
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:58.520]   I doing in this world? What am I altogether? What is men? What is life about? What am I
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:04.080]   meant to do with my life in this world? What are these strange intimations that I feel
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.120]   from time to time that I'm meant for something bigger and greater? What is it all?" Ah, the
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.440]   thoughts may come, but they dismiss them. They've never faced them. They don't understand
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.760]   themselves, they don't understand life and its meaning and its purpose. And I say there's
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.240]   no rhyme or reason about their life. It's not set on a definite course, there's no plan,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.800]   no purpose in it all. They just are the victims of what may happen to them. If a bit of good
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:40.280]   fortune comes, they're happy. If it's bad fortune, they become miserable and disconsolate.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.000]   Their lives are at the mercy of other people and what other people may do or say or think,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.480]   they're not in control. They don't know where they are. The thing isn't mapped out. And
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:58.240]   that leads to my next point, which is this, that they've got no sense of direction. There
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.040]   is no goal. Not having any roads in their lives, they can't say, "I'm going to set out
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:10.440]   from here in order to arrive there." There is no road. And they have no objective in
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.560]   life at all. They've got nothing to look forward to. Have you noticed sometimes when you've
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.400]   read the biographies of men who are not Christians how prominently this comes out? I must confess
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.600]   it always saddens me when I read of a man who's been great, if you like, as a politician
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.400]   or as a singer or as an artist or something like that, and here at last they've reached
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.680]   an age when they can no longer carry on. The man has lost his voice perhaps or he's become
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:45.080]   too old to get new ideas, and he sits down and he writes his autobiography. And what
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:52.960]   is it? Well, it's all looking back. They never look forward. And you somehow feel it as you
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.800]   go on reading the book. You say, "How many more years has he got to go? He's coming to
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.640]   the end of his career, and what then?" Well, there's nothing. They recall the moments of
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.880]   their triumphs, the time when they did their big and their great, and it's very thrilling,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.360]   it's very wonderful. But there's nothing to look forward to. It just seems to have come
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   and have gone. There wasn't a steady purpose. There was no goal, and at the end they're
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.920]   left with nothing. Just emptiness, just nothing at all. The road seems to have gone so far,
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   then there's a sudden end, as it were. There's nothing. There's no direction. But above all,
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:38.400]   and perhaps one of the saddest things of all about this trackless, pathless kind of heart
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:50.840]   and of life is this, that when they find themselves in a crisis or in an emergency, there is nowhere
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:58.560]   where they can go for help and for aid and for sustenance. There they are, you see, living
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:05.280]   this kind of heedless, thoughtless, unplanned life without any direction or purpose, without
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.480]   ever having taken true thought, but just taking things as they came. And at last they find
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.000]   themselves in a great emergency. Something terrible has gone wrong. Illness, perhaps,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.200]   or the illness of a dear one, some loss, financial or otherwise, some calamity. Something's gone
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.920]   wrong, and they're in a real crisis. And there's nowhere where they can go because there's
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.280]   no road. They may have heard that there's some great power that can help over there,
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.360]   but how to get there? It'll take so long to go through the brushwood, to go through this
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.720]   trackless waste, and they may never arrive. They've never planned it out, so they're left
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:50.000]   to themselves. It all comes down upon them, and there's nowhere where they can go.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.520]   There are no roads in their lives. There are no highways. It's nothing but a trackless
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:10.000]   waste. Now, am I exaggerating? Am I being unfair when I suggest that that is the life,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.400]   it seems to me, of the vast majority of people in this world tonight? I wonder whether I'm
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:26.560]   addressing anybody in that very situation at this moment. Have you sat down and considered
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.200]   life and its meaning and its purpose? Are you in control of yourself? Do you know where
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:40.080]   you're going? Have you an object and a purpose? Have you got a great highway that you can
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.840]   run along in the hour of your need? To that source of supply and of help without which
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:54.480]   you're lost and completely finished. Now I say that this, alas, is the tragedy of man
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.080]   as he is as the result of sin. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know where he's
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.800]   going, and especially he doesn't know it in the hour of his greatest need, in the hour
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:12.480]   of the final emergencies, when everything seems to give way beneath him. Now then, the
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.320]   glory of religion, according to this man, is that it changes all that. Blessed is the
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:31.240]   man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are ways, the highways of God, the made roads
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:38.360]   that solve the problem and that transform and transfigure everything. Order! There is
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.760]   nothing, I say, that is more glorious and wonderful about this Christian life than just
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.560]   this very element, the order! What am I talking about? Well, let me hurriedly tell you something
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:57.520]   about it. This is the great message of the Christian faith. How are these roads made?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.680]   We must start there, mustn't we? How does it happen that a man who was like a trackless
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.760]   wilderness suddenly becomes like a chartered territory, with the great highways and arterial
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.800]   roads and the branches, and the whole thing mapped out and laid out perfectly, and everything
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:21.240]   in order, and he knows where he is and what he can do? How does it happen? Well, you know,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.760]   I've already given you the answer in one of my readings at the beginning. It's all there
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   in 2 Corinthians 4, 6, isn't it? God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.280]   has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   face of Jesus Christ. What was Paul thinking of when he wrote that, you think? Well, this
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.920]   is what he was thinking of, Genesis 1 and 2, the first two verses in the Bible. In the
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:06.080]   beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.320]   darkness was upon the face of the deep, or if you like, chaos was upon the surface of
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:22.680]   it all, and the Spirit of God moved upon the surface of the waters. And God said, "Let
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:30.000]   there be light." And there was light, and from that moment the chaos disappears and
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.760]   the order begins to come in, and life, creation, comes into being, and God looked at it all
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:49.040]   and saw that it was good. That's it. And you see, that is exactly what happens in Christianity.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   Into the chaos and disorder and this trackless waste of a man's life there comes the operation
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:07.120]   and the activity of the blessed Holy Spirit of God. Oh, thank God it's still true. That's
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.160]   the thing that Midsoll of Tarsus, an apostle, that into the chaos of his life God shined
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.880]   in the face of Jesus Christ, as he had done over the cosmos at the beginning, and order
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:26.440]   came in, into the disorder that had previously been the characteristic of his life. Oh, like
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:33.480]   a land being charted and mapped out and planned, the Holy Spirit begins to do his blessed work.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:40.600]   What is it? Well, the work of the Holy Spirit is to lead us to repentance and to regeneration,
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:50.080]   isn't it? And what is this? What is repentance? Well, as I understand the fortieth chapter
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.240]   of the book of the prophet Isaiah, and as it is quoted, you remember, in the third chapter
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   of Matthew and in other places, this is what happens. Repentance is that which prepares
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.360]   the way for the Lord. Repentance is that which prepares us for the reception of the Lord
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:16.040]   Jesus Christ and his new life. What is it? Well, here it is. It's the command, you remember,
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.160]   to make a highway for the Lord. How is it done? This is how it's done. Every valley
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.600]   shall be exalted and every high hill shall be made low. The rough places shall be made
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.320]   smooth. Haven't you seen it being done? Haven't you seen it being done in this country? The
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.240]   road naturally went up and down, or the land went up and down like that. But you don't
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.480]   make a road like that, do you? A kind of switchback. What do you do? Well, you take off these mountains,
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:52.080]   as it were, and you put them into the plains, and you've got a level highway. The Holy Spirit
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.480]   does something like that. The Holy Spirit is the greatest leveler in the world. May
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:11.360]   I use a modern illustration? The Holy Spirit is a divine bulldozer. He just flattens. He
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   convicts us of our sin. And when we thought we were great and mighty and knowledgeable
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.600]   and that we could manage our own affairs, he just puts us flat on the ground and discovers
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.460]   to us that we knew nothing, that we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God,
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:34.760]   that our lives were as I've been describing, and that we are nothing at all. Every high
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:44.600]   mountain shall be brought low. And then, when we are so low as to think that we can never
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:52.400]   rise and that we are hopeless and damned, he raises us up again. "Ah," said the ancient
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.600]   Simeon to Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, as he held the infant in his arms,
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:05.400]   "this child is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel." The leveler.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.880]   The new road that is made, preparing the way of the Lord, makes straight a highway in the
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   desert for our God. Repentance. And not only repentance, I say, but regeneration, the new
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.880]   life, the new faculty, the new principle of life that is put into us by the operation
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:37.640]   of the Holy Spirit. Regeneration. For it isn't enough merely to pull down and to raise. You
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.480]   need some substance, some solidity. And you need a plan, you need a direction. And it
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:51.840]   all comes in Christ. Repentance, regeneration, the blessed work of the Holy Spirit. I mustn't
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.200]   stay with that this evening because I'm anxious to describe its results. But let us never
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.800]   forget that this is a work that can only be done by the Spirit of God. You see, mankind
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.640]   forgetting the Holy Spirit, failing to realize that redemption is the work of God and of
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.080]   God alone, has been trying to save itself. That's the meaning of planning. That's the
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:18.280]   meaning of philosophy. And the world has been very busy trying to clear the trackless waste,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.840]   hasn't it? It's been doing it for centuries. And we've been told that at last we've got
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.040]   the expert method. But where is it? Look at the chaos in the world this evening. Look
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.560]   at the utter confusion. Look at the nations. They know not where they are, and nobody knows
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.960]   where we are going. What's the value of your philosophy in the modern situation? Or all
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:45.320]   your art and all that the world has produced, is there a highway? Where is it? No, no. This
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:54.360]   is a work that God and God alone can do. God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.560]   has shined in our hearts and has said, "Let there be light and let the chaos disappear
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:08.480]   and order come in." And it comes. What does it lead to? Well, here it is. He gives us
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:19.040]   a clear view of life. He gives us a new way of thinking. The apostle Paul, again, once
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:26.240]   and forever has put this thing so perfectly that I simply repeat his words. He says, "The
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.040]   natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.320]   him." Neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned. He says, "This new man in Christ,
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   he is a new creature, he is a new creation. No man understands him, but he understands
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:52.240]   all things. What's his secret?" He says, "Well, this is it. We have the mind of Christ."
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:29:00.320]   A new understanding. Oh, my dear friends, never go wrong on this. Christianity is truth,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.720]   and truth comes to the mind, and truth is intellectual. This isn't sob stuff, this
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.760]   isn't emotionalism. You know, the very first thing that happens to a man when he becomes
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.640]   a Christian is that he begins to think straightly. The highway of the mind is laid open, and
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:26.400]   he begins to see life as he's never seen it before. It comes, I say, and it gives him
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:33.520]   a new understanding. Oh, for the first time in his life he has a whole view of life. What
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:42.200]   do I mean? I mean this. The gospel of Jesus Christ gives a man a clear view of himself,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:50.120]   because it gives him a view of himself as under God and in relationship to God. And
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:56.960]   so he begins to see it all. He begins to understand himself and the causes of his failure and
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:03.480]   of his misery. Until then, he thought that all unhappiness was because of somebody else.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.440]   Other people not behaving themselves as they should. He was perfect. If only other people
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.040]   would be the same. But they were saying the same about him. He doesn't understand. The
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.520]   whole thing is chaos. And then things go wrong. Why should they go wrong with me? What have
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:23.560]   I done? He doesn't understand. But the moment a man becomes a Christian, he begins to see
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:30.160]   it. He realizes that he is as he is, and things have happened to him very largely because
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.800]   of his sin, because of his folly in separating himself and cutting himself off from the life
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:43.720]   of God, because he's made himself an autonomous being which he isn't and never can be, but
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   he persuaded himself he was. And there he is alone, and he's cut himself off from the
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:56.560]   eternal blessings, and all the consequences are followed. He begins to see this. And he
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.080]   begins to see that the whole world is as it is tonight for the same reason. That men are
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.600]   selfish and self-centered, and therefore jealous and envious, and therefore thinking of war
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.880]   and of aggrandizement, and each one wanting to be on top, and hating all others who are
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.480]   trying to do the same thing. And the whole world is upside down and in a state of chaos.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:26.760]   He begins to see it all. So he's no longer bewildered as to what's the matter with himself
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:33.000]   nor with others, and thank God he goes beyond that. He sees how it can all be put right.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.560]   He sees that all self-effort will lead to nothing, that all attempts at self-reformation
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:46.720]   are a pure waste of time. He suddenly sees that into this uncharted, trackless waste,
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.360]   God has sent down his own Son, with a plan laid out before him, with a redemption, and
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:32:03.880]   he's made a way. From men in his chaotic condition, to God, to redemption, to order, to salvation,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.560]   to blessings that can never be described adequately. In other words, let me put it like this, I'm
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.680]   hurrying on and just throwing great principles at you, but work them out for yourselves,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:18.360]   my dear friends, and go on doing it as long as you're in this world. I'm simply putting
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.560]   in another form, you see, any typical New Testament epistle. That's what each New Testament
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:33.600]   epistle is, in a sense. It's just a map of life. They start off with their great doctrines,
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.480]   you see, and there you're given the understanding, this insight, this intellectual apprehension.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.680]   There is no more intellectual book in the world than the Bible. Your own intellect and
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:48.040]   mind will never grasp it until it's been enlightened by the Spirit. But then, why I say here it
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:59.400]   is, food for the mind, something to look at for all eternity, nothing comparable to it.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   I stand in this pulpit this evening to say, and I say to the glory of God in Jesus Christ,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:19.120]   I understand life. I understand myself. I understand life. I am not a bit surprised
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:26.760]   that the world is as it is this evening, not a bit. I could have prophesied it. I began
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.240]   preaching thirty years ago, you know, when people were still optimistic. There had been
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.520]   one world war, but they said, "It's all right, we'll never do that again." And they were
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.560]   preaching with optimism, and I began preaching chaos and sin and man as he is, and I prophesied
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.800]   that war would come. Of course I did. There was nothing clever about that. I simply believed
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:56.040]   my Bible. I simply had a view of life presented to me here, plain and clear. While men is
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:05.760]   sinful, there will be wars. And it's just idle fancy and nonsense to imagine that while
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.400]   men and women are self-centered and selfish, that they'll do anything but fight one another
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.320]   in some shape or form. James, you see, has said it all. "Whence come wars amongst you,
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:25.940]   even from your lusts that are in you?" No, no. There is no difficulty about understanding
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.400]   the world today if you were a Christian and if you believed this message. It's all here.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.040]   It's a perfect, complete view of life. But let me hurry on. What else? Well, it gives
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:43.840]   us a sense of purpose and of direction. You see, this shows us that life is, after all,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:52.800]   just a pilgrimage, and that we are only strangers and pilgrims and sojourners in this world.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.400]   The Christian starts by seeing that, and he's not depressed by that. No, no, he's got a
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.160]   sense of direction, he's working to a goal, he sees himself as a traveler. Of course,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.440]   the people who are unhappy, you see, are the people who think this is the only life and
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:12.200]   the only world. And therefore they're horrified at the thought of death. "Going out of this
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.960]   world is the last calamity." They say about a person who dies, "Poor so-and-so." The
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:28.320]   Christian doesn't. The Christian has an objective, a sense of direction, he has a purpose. Not
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.520]   only that, he has a system of living and order in his living. You see, the man who's not
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.840]   a Christian hasn't any system or order, he hasn't any discipline. He says, "If I want
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.240]   a thing, I must have it. If I like a thing, why shouldn't I have it? Perhaps somebody
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.520]   else wants it, what's it matter? I want it, so I'm going to have it. Hence your divorce
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:54.400]   and all the rest of it." But when a man becomes a Christian, there is a way made in his life,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:00.680]   not only an intellectual way, but a moral way. Those great New Testament epistles to
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.120]   which I've referred you, not only have their great doctrine at the beginning, they then
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.920]   go on to apply them. They say, "In the light of this road on which you're traveling, don't
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:15.560]   wander there, don't wander here, go straight on." Moral understanding, planning, roads
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.160]   made, everything fitting in together, a great purpose in life, not only intellectually,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.920]   but morally. "Blessed is the man," says this man, "towards the end. No good thing will
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:33.720]   he withhold from them that walk uprightly." And what makes a man walk uprightly is that
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.800]   he's walking along a highway. He's no longer crouching there in this trackless waste and
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:44.840]   trying to brush away all these obstructions. The road is there and he walks along it, a
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:52.240]   highway made by God, a way of holiness. He knows what he's doing, he's disciplined,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.760]   he has esteem of life. It's all there in the injunctions in the Old Testament and in the
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:09.040]   New. But I must add this to show you the complete contrast with the other. And this is in many
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:16.280]   ways the most marvelous and wonderful thing of all. They're all wonderful. And that is
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   that this man having a highway in his life, when he meets his calamity and trouble and
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:30.600]   trials, thank God he knows where the road is. And he doesn't sit there frantically saying,
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.520]   "If only there were a road and a way. If only I could get there, but I can't. I can't get
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   through this brushwood." The road is wide open. "When all things seem against me to drive
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:55.560]   me to despair, I know one gate is open. One ear will hear my prayer. The highway to God.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.640]   It's already there. It's already been put within him. Christ has implanted it through
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   the Spirit and he can go straight on to it." But let me close by putting that to you in
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.080]   terms of the second picture which this man uses. Listen. He says, "Blessed is the man
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:21.400]   whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are waves, who passing through the valley
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:30.280]   of Baccha make it a well." Do you know what that means? What is this valley of Baccha?
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:36.440]   Well, let me again put it in the form of a principle. The Christian life not only brings
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.720]   order into my life, but because it brings order into my life, it enables me to rejoice
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:49.160]   even in the midst of tribulations. What is the valley of Baccha? Well, another translation
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:59.680]   puts it like this. "As they go through the vale of tears, they make it a place of springs."
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.040]   The valley of Baccha, the authorities say, that a better translation is to say, "The
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:10.680]   valley of tears, the valley of sighing, the valley of sorrow." Some say that the very
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.360]   tree which the reference is made to in this valley of Baccha is that it was a kind of
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.920]   tear tree, and it was known as the tear tree. It doesn't matter. Whether Baccha stands
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:28.140]   for some particular kind of tree called a tear tree, or whether the word should really
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:35.840]   be translated "tears" itself, the idea is exactly the same thing. It's a place
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:45.760]   of weeping. And you notice he says it's a valley, down in the depths. A valley always
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:52.380]   carries this idea in the Scripture of being down in the depths. When we are in a place
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:58.680]   that is shut in and hemmed in, and when there are trials and troubles and tribulations,
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:05.560]   and everything is calculated to make us miserable and utterly dejected and disconsolate, the
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:15.940]   valley of Baccha. And you notice what he says. "Who, while passing through the valley of
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:25.160]   Baccha, make it a well, they turn it into a place of springs." They're in a place
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:31.880]   that tends to unloose the springs of our tears and the fountains of our eyes. "Ah, yes,"
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.160]   he says, "but these men have got something within them that enables them to turn that
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:43.480]   valley into a place of joyful springs, of delight and of glory and of happiness."
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:55.920]   They make it, even while they're in it, a place of spring. Now this is astounding.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.160]   This man doesn't hesitate to make that claim, and you will find as you read the Psalms that
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:08.100]   the psalmist is always making this claim. And thank God this is something to which the
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:14.200]   saints of the centuries have always testified. Do you know that the saints have always said
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   this? They have said the blessings of this Christian life are always great and glorious
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:32.040]   and wonderful. But you know, they say, they're greatest of all in times of trouble. You read
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:38.120]   the lives of some of them, or even in our own lifetime in the concentration camps in
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.040]   Germany and other places, and you'll all find that they say this. They say with the author
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:48.720]   of the 119th Psalm, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted." Yes, they say it's
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.200]   in the furnace you find the value of it. It's there. Now this is the test of any view of
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.720]   life, isn't it? It's all very well to have a gay view of life while the sun is shining
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:05.120]   and when you're on your holidays. Here's the test. What are you like when everything goes
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.440]   wrong, when everything turns against you, and all your world and all your dreams and
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:17.640]   hopes seem to be coming crashing to the ground at your very feet, in the valley of Bacchus,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.360]   in the place of weeping, where trial comes upon trial and tribulation upon tribulation?
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:30.960]   What are you like there? That's the test. This man, according to the Psalmist, triumphs
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.720]   even in the valley of Bacchus. What's he mean? It means this. He's no longer a victim of
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:46.160]   his circumstances. He was before. Ah, he was the nicest fellow in the town when everything
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.880]   was going well, and he had plenty of money in his pockets. There was never a happier
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:57.760]   man in the world and he thought that religion was very morbid and very depressing. But suddenly
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:05.840]   he's lost his health, he's lost his work, he's lost his money, he's lost his friends.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:12.280]   And he's down and out, he's consolate, miserable, can't be roused, can't be cheered, doesn't
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.720]   know what to do with himself, defeated entirely. The valley of Bacchus gets him down and he
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.640]   can do nothing. He can try with a kind of stoical fortitude, not to whimper and cry,
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:29.360]   but he has no consolation. He doesn't know what to do. Not so this man. This man, blessed
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:36.200]   is this man, who passing through the valley of Bacchus, makes it a well, turns it into
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.000]   a spring. You see, he doesn't just put up with it. He doesn't just manage to go through
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.040]   with it. He's more than conqueror. Oh, listen to the psalmist saying it in Psalm 23, "Yea,
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:54.200]   thou walk'st through the valley of the shadow of death, thy rod and thy staff they comfort
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:00.640]   me." Even in that valley there's something that fills him with joy and happiness. Listen
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   to the apostle Paul saying it gloriously in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Philippians,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:18.560]   "I know both how to be abased and how to abound. I can do all things through Christ,
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:25.120]   which strengthens me. I don't care where I am. I don't care what happens to me. I don't
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:32.760]   care what's going on around me. I am what I am in Christ, and I triumph in him. Rejoice
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:41.320]   in the Lord always, he says, and again I say unto you, rejoice." Even in the valley of
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:49.000]   Bacchus, we not only rejoice in the contemplation of the glory of God, says Paul in the epistle
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.480]   to the Romans, but more than that, we rejoice also in tribulations, more than conquerors,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.800]   turning the valley of Bacchus into a well, a place of springs, and of rejoicing. What's
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:10.880]   the secret? Oh, it's just this. I've already been giving the answer. It's their view of
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.480]   life that enables them to do that. It's the fact that they've got these ways. You see,
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.800]   it works like this. What is the effect of troubles in the valley of Bacchus upon them?
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.440]   Just this. The troubles make them think all the more about God and about Christ. You see,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.040]   when they were not in the valley, oh, there were many other things to do, and the moon
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.680]   compels them. But suddenly all is gone, and they're left alone, and that in itself makes
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.480]   them go back to God. And to go back to God is to rejoice, and to think of Christ and
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:48.400]   what he's done for them. And their rejoicing is increased. This is the whole secret of
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.480]   the Christian life. The more things go against us, the more they drive us to Christ, and
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.360]   the more we are with Christ, the happier we are. So we turn our valleys of Bacchus into
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:08.720]   wells and into places of rejoicing. And this in addition. Here I am, a pilgrim going through
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.640]   this world. I know that I start with that. I'm no longer afraid of that. I start with
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.920]   the fact of death, that I'm going to die, and I don't know when. I'm not afraid of that.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.520]   I put it down on my map. There's the road. I'm going along it. All right. Very well.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.960]   I thank God for all the light the gospel has given me. But suddenly I find myself in a
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.560]   valley of Bacchus. I'm not promised that I shan't be sent there. Christ said, "In the
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:42.320]   world you shall have tribulations," but he said, "Cheer up. I have overcome the world."
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:49.200]   Oh yes, the Christian does find himself in the valley of Bacchus sometimes. But you see,
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.440]   he turns that into a place, a spring of wells and of rejoicing in this way. He says, "Yes,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:10.640]   I'm here now." But our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:17.720]   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. "Ah," says the Christian, "I am in the valley
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:23.040]   of Bacchus. My health is going. My powers are waning. My loved ones are taken from me.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.800]   I know. Why should I ever have thought that that wouldn't happen to me? Of course it must
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   happen, but it's all right. This life is a temporary journey. I'm only here as a sojourner.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.560]   I'm going on. I'm a child of God. I'm a pilgrim of eternity. I know that there awaits me a
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:53.720]   glory that baffles description." You see, he does it like this. He is able to say something
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:07.280]   like this, "When all created streams are dry, thy fullness is the same." Whatever may be
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:16.640]   true of the valley of Bacchus, God never changes. And so he can go on and add this, "The storms
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:30.520]   may roar about me. My heart may low be laid. But God is round about me. And can I be dismayed?
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:38.360]   Green pastures are before me which I have yet not seen. Bright skies will soon be o'er
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:51.280]   me where the dark clouds have been. My hope I cannot measure. My path to life is free.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:49:05.160]   My Savior has my treasure, and he will walk with me." My beloved friend, are there ways
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:15.160]   in your life? Is the highway of God and of Christ in you? Do you know where you are in
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:23.680]   this world? Do you know where you're going? Have you understanding? Is it all clarity?
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:31.520]   Face it honestly. And if you have to admit it's scarce, go and admit it to God. Plead
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:37.720]   with him, ask him to do the mighty operation of the Holy Spirit, to send the bulldozer
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:47.760]   and to thaw the waste, and to make his own way in your soul that will bring you to himself.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:57.640]   And once you know him, and once you know Christ, and that you are safe in him, whatever valley
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:05.560]   of Bacchus you may chance to have to go through, you, as certainly as this psalmist of old,
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:15.640]   will make it a well. Oh, the blindness of man in sin that doesn't recognize such riches,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:27.920]   such glory, such an amazing offer. But here it is. "Blessed is the man that trusteth in
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:35.880]   thee." Oh yes, thrice blessed. There is no happiness comparable to this. Understanding,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:47.200]   order, discipline, and a blessed hope that will never fade away. Amen.
