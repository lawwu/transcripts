[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820]   There are some people like you who are what I call optimizers.
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.980]   The problem with being an optimizer is that it can actually serve you really well.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.360]   Like you over-save, you set yourself up amazingly well, you've done great.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.220]   Every day you look and you're like, oh, the number's going up, like I'm so cool, let me keep doing it.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.960]   The problem is that if you take it to its logical extreme, optimizers become unbearably boring and unbearably cheap.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.660]   They look at cost, the price of a lunch, they go, oh, that taco, we could get it today.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:35.500]   But if we actually take the money and invest it for the next 45 years, that $12 will actually turn into $1,664 and they just end up doing nothing.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.400]   I love optimizers because I get them.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.100]   It's kind of funny, but also it's not funny.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.280]   I want them to realize there's a certain point where you won.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.000]   You won the game.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780]   The point is not to look at another model or another fire subreddit.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:01.700]   It's actually to have gratitude, give yourself a big pat on the back, celebrate, and then turn the page and start focusing on the next chapter, which often is learning the skill of spending money meaningfully.
