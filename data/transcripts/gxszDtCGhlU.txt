[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   In this sermon recorded in the Westminster Chapel on the 2nd of July 1967,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the Book of Acts, chapter 7, verses 54 to 60.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Now, those who attend here regularly will know that we've been considering this great and most important chapter for many, many months.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And we've been following the great argument that was developed by Stephen in the speech that he delivered when he was on trial for his life
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   before that great court in Jerusalem which is called the Sanhedrin.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   You remember the story. Stephen was one of these early Christians.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   He was a man who'd been filled with the Holy Spirit and had been given certain special gifts.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   He was able to teach, he was able to work wonders, and he was a deacon of the church.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   But now they've arrested him and they bring certain charges against him, and these are the essential charges.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   They suborned men which said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "Further, this man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, the temple, and the law."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Now, the position is quite clear.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Stephen is on trial because he's a Christian, because he believes the Christian message.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He believes that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God, and that he had come into the world to save men.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He believes that by dying upon the cross he was the means of atoning for sin, thereby reconciling men unto God.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And he believes further that this is the only way of salvation.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   That was what these early Christians believed, and that is what they preached.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The proof to them of all this was the literal, physical resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   He'd been crucified, he died visibly, they'd taken down his body, they'd put it in a grave, they'd put a stone over it and sealed it, put soldiers to guard it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But they later found the grave to be empty.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He had risen, and he'd manifested himself unto certain chosen witnesses, and then in the presence of some of them he had ascended into heaven.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And furthermore, he had promised before he went that he would send down upon them the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He told these men to tarry in Jerusalem until they should be imbued with power from on high.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He'd spoken before several times of this coming and giving of the Holy Ghost.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And on the day of Pentecost, this thing that he'd promised and prophesied had literally come to pass.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And these men were absolutely transformed and changed, speaking with great power, working miracles, and had become a sensation.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Well now, it is because of this that Stephen is on trial.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Because to these members of the Sanhedrin, and remember, they consisted of the religious leaders as well as the political leaders, to them this is blasphemy.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   This is to be against Moses. This is to be against all their great traditions.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It's to be against the law. It's to be against the temple, and all the worship and the ceremonial of the temple.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Now that's the charge.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And as we've been seeing, in this chapter Stephen takes up these points and deals with them one by one.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's not a difficult case. It was a very easy case.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But he handles it as a man filled with the spirit would handle it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He exposes the utter hollowness of their position, their terrible blindness.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He's able to show them very simply that it is they who are going against their own great traditions.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It is they who are but repeating what their forefathers have done throughout the centuries, as the history of the Old Testament tells us.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And it is they in particular who are going against Moses.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   For Moses, as he reminds them, had actually prophesied the coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me. Him shall he hear."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It is they who have misunderstood the law, for the law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It was the ultimate end and object of the law.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And the temple, what is it? Well, not something which is meant to be permanent.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Again, it's full of types and shadows and bad impressions of the coming of the Lamb of God that's going to take away the sin of the world.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But now, as he has been expounding to them and as we've followed him, he has dealt with all these points.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   He's turned the tables on them completely.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   He has shown them how they have grievously misunderstood the things in which they took pride.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   They've completely misunderstood the great message, as it were, of the Old Testament.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, having dealt with the points one by one and in this historical manner that is displayed in this chapter,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Stephen now has come to the point of application.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And a sermon which doesn't apply the truth is of no value.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Stephen is a true Christian preacher.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   He's argued, presented facts, reasoned, shown them the position.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Now then, application. "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so do ye."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And on he goes. And then their reaction, the violence.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And eventually they stone him to death.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Now then, we are just looking then here at the conclusion of this famous scene when this first Christian martyr Stephen is to be seen standing before and addressing the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Now the way I want to take this with you tonight is this.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We've got a remarkable picture here with a very striking contrast.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   On the one hand, we see these members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And there standing before them, we see Stephen.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   What's this? Well, it's a very perfect representation and portrayal of the difference between unbelief and belief.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The difference between the non-Christian and the Christian.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Never can you find a more dramatic portrayal of this essential contrast than that which you find here.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And this is what I'm concerned about.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   We are not concerned simply in this ancient history, interesting though it is in and of itself.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We are interested in it because it's not only history, but it's preaching to us.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The world is still in the same position as it was when these things happened.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And there is great confusion at the present time as to what a Christian is.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   What is the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Well now, here I say we are shown this very plainly and very clearly.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Here are men, you see, who are aware of the same facts.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And yet their attitude towards them is diametrically opposed, essentially different.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   To Stephen, these things are the only things that matter.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   To the Sanhedrin, they are something that cause them to be filled with fury.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   They gnash their teeth and they kill the Christian preacher.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So it is, I say, a very wonderful and perfect portrayal of the essential nature of unbelief.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And that's the aspect of the matter that I'm anxious to consider with you tonight.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Stephen was addressing these members of the Sanhedrin, and this is the big question.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Why do they reject Jesus of Nazareth? That's the question.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And you see, it's still the great question, for the world as it is tonight.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Why do people go on rejecting this Savior and this Gospel?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's the great problem. To me, as I've said so many times in working through this chapter,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   it is the greatest problem of all.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   If only the whole world lived according to this Gospel and the teaching of this book,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   you wouldn't have your world problems, nor your private problems.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But you see, the world won't listen to this.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It'll listen to almost anything else. It's ready to pin its faith in anything else.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But this, it will have nothing to do with it. Rejects it with scorn. Why does it do that?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well, now, we are told here exactly why.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The analysis of the whole mentality and attitude of the Sanhedrin, the members of the Sanhedrin,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   as given by Stephen, plus what they did, gives us, I say, a complete statement of the nature
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   and the character of unbelief. What do we find about it?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Well, now, let me put it like this to you.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Someone may say, "Oh, well, yes, but you know, that's a very extreme case, that.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Are you going to say that what is found there is true of every unbeliever?"
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Well, my answer to that is quite simple.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   These were very learned men, they were great men, they were leaders in the nation.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   They were not fools, they were not ignoramuses.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   These were people who were trained in the law, many of them.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Others trained as priests, and others men in responsible positions.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And it's they who behaved like this, remember.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Well, let's put it like this.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   This is in many ways an extreme case, but the principles that are taught here are of universal validity.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   This is always the characteristic of unbelief.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now, we all vary, of course. Some men do things violently, other men do things quietly.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But the principle is the same, and it's the principle that matters.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And indeed, what one finds so often is this, that people who appear to be so quiet can become very violent and very vicious
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   when this person and this gospel are concerned.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   However, I say, what really matters for us are the principles that are taught here,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   the principles concerning the nature of unbelief.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   What is the character of unbelief?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Well, now, here are very important principles at a time like this.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   People have got such strange ideas as to what it is to believe the gospel and what it is not to believe the gospel.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   What's the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Some people think it's merely a matter of conduct and of behavior.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And nothing but that.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, it is a matter of conduct and behavior, but that in many ways is not the important aspect of the difference
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   between the believer and the non-believer, the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Other people think that the position is this, that the unbeliever is just a man who decides not to believe.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   The believer is a man who decides to believe.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But it's something there on the surface.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   They can do one or the other, one does this, one does that, there it is.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   But you see, this is hopelessly inadequate as an understanding of belief and of unbelief.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And that is the tragedy of the present time, the superficiality with regard to these matters.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   What then is the essential character of unbelief? It is this.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It involves not only what a man does,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   it involves in a total manner a man's entire relationship to God and to truth.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   There is no greater or more profound distinction than that between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Now this is most important.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   You see, the term used by the New Testament constantly by our Lord himself and then by the apostles and others
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   is new birth, regeneration.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   To become a Christian means that you are a new being.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So you see, it's something radical, it is something very profound.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   It's not something that a man can do superficially.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And the distinction between the believer and the unbeliever is not a slight one or a superficial one.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It is the profoundest thing possible.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And you see, the biblical teaching is this.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Unbelief is the result of the fall of man.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Unbelief is that which results from man's original rebellion against God.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And the teaching of the Bible which tells us that when man did rebel against God and when he fell,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   he fell to the depths.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   He fell in the hole of his being.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   It wasn't something superficial.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It was a most radical change in man.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   He became something that was quite different from what he was before.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It was something that affected the whole of his being.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It affected his mind, it affected his will, it affected his heart.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And what I want to show you now is how from the teaching given by Stephen
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and by the behavior of the members of the Sanhedrin,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   what happened to man as the result of his original rebellion and fall is so perfectly illustrated.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Now let's look at this.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   What can I say be more important than this?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Do we realize the real problem of man in the world tonight?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Why doesn't man believe the Gospel?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Why is this solution to the problem so constantly dismissed completely as it was by the Sanhedrin?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Well, here is the answer.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Man has become a sinner.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And as a sinner he is the slave of the devil.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He is in a condition of slavery.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And it affects the whole of his being.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It affects his mind, it affects his will, it affects his heart.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Now listen to Stephen's exposition of this.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He starts, let's start with the mind.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   He puts it like this.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You stiff-necked, he says, and uncircumcised in heart and ears.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   You do always resist the Holy Ghost.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Now it's this first statement that I'm starting with.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Here he is addressing these Jews, these religious Jews,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   these people who are interested in the temple, in Moses, in the law, in the worship of God.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And what he says of them is that they are uncircumcised in heart and in ears.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Now that was a tremendous thing to say.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You see, what he's really saying about them is this.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   That though they are Jews in name and religious in name, that they're actually heathen.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   The difference between the Jew and the heathen, the Jew and the Gentile was the Jew circumcised, the Gentile isn't circumcised.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So what he's saying is this, though you are Jews, in your thinking you are uncircumcised.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You are thinking like heathen.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   You are thinking like people who are natural and not the people of God.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You are boasting that you're the people of God, but you're not.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You are behaving exactly as the Gentiles, the unbelievers.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Now, in other words, what he's saying is this.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Before a man can receive this truth, he must undergo this process which is represented by a kind of circumcision.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   The ears have to be circumcised.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   The heart has to be circumcised.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Something, a radical operation has to be performed upon it.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   In other words, the principle is that man by nature, as the result of the fall and of sin, is incapable of receiving the truth of God.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Now, you see, this is a very profound matter.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Why do these members of the Sanhedrin reject the gospel of Christ?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   The answer is because as they are, they can't do anything else.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They're incapable of believing it.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   They're uncircumcised in heart and in ears.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Now, what it comes to is this, you see, that men by nature can't even listen to this truth properly.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He has no contact with truth.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He's incapable of doing so.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Now, I'm not saying this.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Stephen says it here.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I read to you 1 Corinthians 2 at the beginning, because there the great apostle says it very much more plainly, more explicitly, and he works it out as an argument.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Now, the essential statement, the central statement, of course, is this one.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Why not?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Well, they are foolishness unto him.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Neither can he know them.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   That's what the apostle says.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The natural men cannot know these things.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Why?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   He says because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And, of course, he's been saying this previously.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He says none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   The Son of God appeared before them.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   They didn't recognize him.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   They didn't recognize him, and Paul says they couldn't recognize him.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   They're incapable of recognizing him.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   This is, as I say, one of the profoundest things we can ever grasp.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Our Lord had said it all already.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   He says, "Take heed how ye hear."
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Our Lord says that there are people who hearing do not hear.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Seeing they do not perceive.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   In other words, people can be sitting and they can be listening to this truth, even from the lips of the Son of God.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   They hear the words, but they don't hear what he's saying.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And there were many people like that in his age and generation.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Stephen is saying that that is the trouble with the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   There are people who can be looking at things, and they're really looking at them, but they don't see them.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Now this is something I say that we must grasp as a principle.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   What Stephen is saying about the Sanhedrin, what Paul says about all natural men,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   is that they cannot, as they are, hear this message.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Why? Well, they're lacking in a spiritual apprehension.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   They haven't got it.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Let me use an illustration to explain perhaps what I mean.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   This is only an illustration, remember, but I think it does help.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   You see, the Apostle argues that these things we have received, he says,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   not the spirit that is of the world, but the spirit that is of God,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   in order that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   which things also we speak, he says.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Not in the words that man's wisdom uses, but he said we speak these things in spiritual terms,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   What does he mean by all this? Well, here's my illustration.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Take the question of poetry.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Here's a man, if you like, reading poetry.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   To some people, it's the most thrilling thing they've ever heard in their lives.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   To others, it's meaningless, gibberish.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   There's nothing in it at all.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   That often happens, doesn't it?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Or you can take people to see great pictures.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Some may wave over it, others see nothing in it at all.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Music plays some of the great masterpieces.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Oh, it delights the heart of some people.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   To others, it's just noise.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And then there are others who seem to regard mere noise as music, and so on.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Well, now, what are these differences? What is the cause of all this?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Well, here's the point, you see, that Stephen is dealing with, as the apostle deals with it also.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   What he's saying is this. They're both saying it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   You need a faculty before you can appreciate these things.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   The natural man, he receives not the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   because they're foolishness to him.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Neither can he know them. Why not?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Because they are spiritually deserved. They are spiritual things.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And unless you've got the corresponding spirit in you,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   you won't be able to appreciate these spiritual things.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   They'll be foolishness to you.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   You see, it's like the man who is entirely devoid of any kind of poetic interest or ability or instinct.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Poetry doesn't speak to him.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   There are other people who are tone-deaf.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Music says nothing at all to them.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It says this same wonderful music doesn't speak to them.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   There are others who may be great poets, but science is nonsense to them.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   They can't begin to follow it. They don't understand it at all.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   It's all a lot of nonsense to them.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Now, you see, they're looking at the same things, but they don't mean the same to them.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And it all depends upon something in you that corresponds to the thing with which you're dealing.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now, the apostle, it's his illustration, not mine, he says, you see,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   that the trouble with the natural man is that he cannot appreciate the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   and he regards them as foolishness. Why?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Well, because he hasn't got the Spirit of God in him.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   His nature is twisted, it's perverted, it's fallen.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   His mind can't appreciate these things.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   It's nonsense to him, and he rejects it.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Uncircumcised of heart and of ears, they cannot believe it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Very well, here I think is the most important thing for us all to remember at the present time.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   It's a very important word for the unbeliever that may be listening to me at this moment.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Have you ever realized this, my friend?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   You probably have taken the position, haven't you, that you could believe this whenever you liked,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   but that you don't decide to believe it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I'm telling you that the trouble with you is that you can't believe it,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   that you're dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Have you ever realized the truth about yourself?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Can you sit and listen to this gospel about this Son of God and what He's done and not be moved?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   What a terrible condition you're in.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Have you realized that?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But let me apply this to the Christian believer.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I find many Christian people are very troubled and upset,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   because in general it seems to be the case at the present time in this world
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   that the great philosophers and the great scientists are rejecters of the gospel
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and that they don't believe it.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And I find many Christian people very troubled about this.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And they're afraid of this charge of being unintellectual,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   or that they're obscurantists,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   or that they've undergone some psychological change or something like that.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And they're in trouble about this, as to why these great men don't believe the gospel.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   You must never be worried by that again.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   There's only one thing to say about them.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   They are uncircumcised of heart and of ears.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   They are natural men.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And the natural men, given the greatest brain in the universe,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   simply cannot even begin to hear this thing truly.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   He can't do it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   It's impossible for him.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And so, you see, he makes a fool of himself.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   He criticizes it. He doesn't understand this.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   He's always asking his questions and talking about his difficulties.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Why? Well, because he's ignorant as to his whole condition.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   He is lacking in the essential faculty and ability that enables anyone to believe this great and glorious gospel.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   The natural men receive not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually deserved.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   You are uncircumcised of heart and of ears.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   What a devastating thing the fall was.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   The mind of man has been so affected that he has no appreciation at all of God and the things pertaining to God.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   In his first creation, this was everything to him.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   He was made in the image and likeness of God. He enjoyed communion and fellowship with God.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And these were the things that ravished his heart.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   He has lost it. He has lost it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   He has lost his appreciation of God and the things of God.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   But not only that.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   This, you see, in turn, leads to blindness.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Now, again, we've got this statement here by Stephen.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He said, what you're doing is nothing new.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   You go on repeating the errors and the mistakes and the conduct of your forefathers.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have been now the betrayers and the murderers.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Well, that's his way of talking about the blindness of the unregenerate.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   The blindness of the unbeliever.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   His incapacity for seeing the truth that is held before him.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   He doesn't see it. It's there, but he doesn't see it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Now, the apostle Paul, again, in writing his second epistle to the Corinthians, has put this in unambiguous language.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they believe the glorious gospel of Christ.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Have you ever realized that?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   You think you're free.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they believe.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   They're slaves. They're not allowed to believe.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Now, but listen to Stephen working it out.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   He says, your fathers, here they were, they were visited.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   God raised up a series of marvelous men, prophets.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   He gave them revelations.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   He gave them ability to write and to speak.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   He gave them the ability to expound the condition in which the nation was.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   He had to call them to righteousness, to expound the law, and to prophesy things to come.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   These mighty men of God, this succession.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   But he said, your fathers, they persecuted these men.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   They disliked them.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And that is the story that you read in the Old Testament.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   The children of Israel generally preferred the false prophet.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And they persecuted the true prophet. Why?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Well, the false prophet always prophesied smooth things to them.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   It was all light and easy.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Heal her to the daughter of my people, lightly saying, peace, peace, when there is no peace.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   The false prophet does it all so simply, and it's so nice.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And they're always ready to believe.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   But the false prophet, he probed, he analyzed, he condemned.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   He showed them themselves as they were.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And they hated him.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And they persecuted him.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   The nation had been blind to the message of these messengers of God.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And they had always withstood.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   And the real trouble was that they couldn't see it.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   That was the difficulty.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   You see, they didn't merely act like this for the sake of doing so.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   They could not see it.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   They were blind.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And then he goes on to point out how the Sanhedrin was infinitely worse.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You are only doing, he says, what your fathers have done before you.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   But this is what you are doing.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You can't see that what has happened in this Jesus of Nazareth
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   is nothing but a fulfillment of the prophecies of your great prophets.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   They have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He says, you are interested in religion.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   You are the religious leaders.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You are interested in the writings of the prophets.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   You say that you are superior to all other nations
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   because you have got these prophetic writings.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   But have you read your prophets?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Haven't you seen that the prophets have prophesied that a just one was going to come?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Some of them tell you where he is to be born, the circumstances, the poverty, and so on.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   They give you dates and things of that description.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   The prophets have prophesied the coming of this Jesus
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   whom you have rejected and have now slain and murdered having betrayed him.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Now isn't this an extraordinary thing?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Look at it as a phenomenon.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Here are learned men, religious men.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   They've got the writings of the prophets before them.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   They read them, they study them, they're interested in them.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And yet, they've never seen the message.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Here is, I say, the phenomenon that we've got to recognize.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   This is the essential nature of unbelief.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   That a man can look with his eyes at the message and not see it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   He can hear it and yet not hear it.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   They'd completely missed this astonishing way in which Jesus of Nazareth
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   is a fulfillment of the prophecies of the prophets.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Not only that.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   They had actually looked at him.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   They'd heard him.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   They'd seen his miracles.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And still, they've never seen him.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   John can say, "We beheld his glory."
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   The glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   But these men, these religious authorities,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   they could look into the face of the Son of God.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   They could look into those eternal depths of love in his eyes, in his face.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And see nothing but this fellow, this carpenter.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Now, my dear friends, you've got to come face to face with this.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   What is it that renders a man incapable of recognizing what he sees
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   standing there before him?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   What is this?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Is unbelief something merely intellectual, something light and superficial,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   something within the control of men?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Can't you see it is obviously something deeper?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   They missed the glory of the person.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   They missed the perfection and the wonder and the amazement of his life.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   They could see the miracles and just for a moment be affected,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   but then dismiss it and go into some legalistic matter
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   as to whether he should do it on a Sunday or not,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and who was giving him the right and the authority.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   They missed the essence.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   What is this that makes a man behave in such a manner?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   They'd heard his teaching, I say, his teaching about God.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Some pagan soldiers said never men speak like this men,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   and yet these men, they couldn't get it, they couldn't see it.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   His exposition of the law as given in the Sermon on the Mount, didn't see it.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   They were rather annoyed simply because they said he has no right to speak.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You see, they are so concerned about their own decorum and their own dignity
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   as the appointed teachers that this man is to them an upstart.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   They don't listen to what he says.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   They are interested in the surroundings, in the degrees, qualifications as it were,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   who has appointed him, who is this upstart?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And so they'd never hear his message at all.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   This is unbelief in its very essence.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And then what he says about the object of his coming into this world,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   son of men, he has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   He's the friend of publicans and sinners.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   He gives hope to the downcast, the downtrodden, the hopeless, the vile,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   the refuse of society.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   His amazing offer, free forgiveness, son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Go and send on off. All this means nothing to him.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And on top of that, this is what Stephen's saying.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   He says, are you completely blind to what is happening to these men amongst whom I live now,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   these apostles as we call them?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   You know what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   You've seen the miracle sinners.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   You've heard their preaching, you've seen me.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   He says, why is it, what's the matter?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Can't you see, can't you see the significance?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Can you really explain all this away?
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Is all this nothing?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   You're seeing facts, but are you seeing them?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   The fact is you can't see them, you're blind.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You're like your fathers.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   They never saw the real significance of the prophet as persons,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   the phenomenon of prophecy, and also what they said, and what they prophesied.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And you, he says, all this is happening before you.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   You see nothing in it.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   He says, look at me.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Who am I? How am I capable of doing these things?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Can you see it? But they can't.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   In other words, you see, the fall of men in sin is not only incapable of hearing,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   he's incapable of seeing and understanding.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   He's blinded by the God of this world.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Well, there it is, hurriedly with regard to the mind.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   But look at it in terms of the will.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   You stiff-necked and uncircumcised, in hearts esteem.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Man, as the result of sin, is not only in terrible trouble in his mind
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and rendered incapable of appreciating God and the truth of God
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and the most glorious things that have ever happened in this universe,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   but he's in terrible trouble in the realm of his will.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Stiff-necked, stubborn.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   What does that mean?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Well, you know, this is the trouble with the unbeliever.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He's not ready to listen.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   He not only can't, but he's not ready to.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   He won't even allow himself to listen.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   His whole approach is antagonistic and he is determined to resist.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Oh, have you seen the depth of sin?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You know, I'll tell you why people don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   There's only one explanation.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   It is that they've never seen the problem of sin.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   It is that they've never seen the depth of sin,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   that it is such a profound problem that it takes the coming of the Son of God from heaven
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and his dying and resurrection and a miraculous action to save man in sin.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   He's so totally formed.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Here he is in the realm of his will.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Man is never neutral.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Oh, I know people like to think of it like that.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   That a man sits and listens to the gospel.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He can accept or refuse, whichever he likes.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   It's all within his control and sometimes or less.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   The preacher seems to agree that that is the position.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   It's not, you know, it's never the position at all.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Man is never neutral.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Man is never open-minded.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Man is always by nature antagonistic to the truth.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Now listen to Paul putting this.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   He says that the carnal mind is enmity against God.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Not neutral, enmity against God.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   He is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And it's simply the truth about every one of us by nature.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Man is opposed to it instinctively.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Everything that is in him is against it.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   He doesn't listen with an open mind.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Men reject the gospel.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   They've never read the Bible.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   They don't know the case.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   They know nothing about the history of Christianity and the Christian church.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   They've never really investigated.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   We all start by thinking that we are very clever in adolescence or somewhere around about that age.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   We think the cleverest thing we can ever do and the thing that proves that we are men
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   is that we say the gospel is nonsense, Christianity is ridiculous,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   something that's an insult to a man's intelligence.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   That's what we believe.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What's this?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   It's just this violent prejudice.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   We are opposed to the gospel, stiff-necked, stubborn.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   We don't want to listen, we don't want to hear, but it's even worse than that.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Listen.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   you do always resist the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   As your fathers did, so do ye.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   What does this mean?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Well, you see, this means that man is not passive in his refusal to listen to this gospel.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   There is a terrible and a malign activity about his rejection.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   You do always resist the Holy Ghost, says Stephen.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   What does this mean?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Well, it means this, you see,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   that these men have not merely listened to a kind of academic or theoretical statement of a message.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   They had listened to preaching in the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Stephen, I read, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles amongst the people.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   He spoke to them here, and they couldn't answer him.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   They couldn't say a word against him.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   They couldn't make any reply to what he was saying, and yet they resisted.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   They stirred up the people, they set up false witnesses,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   but they couldn't resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And the same was true of the preaching of Peter on the day of Pentecost,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and his oppresses before the Sanhedrin.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   They'd already arrested Peter and John more than once, as the story tells us,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   in the earlier chapters, as Peter had spoken filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   It isn't a mere academic and detached statement.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Oh no, the Holy Spirit was operative.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   The power, the pressure of the Spirit, and these men have felt something of it.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   When a man is speaking under the power of the Holy Ghost,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   even the natural man knows that there's something unusual.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   He can't help feeling it, and yet he resists.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   He deliberately resists the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   The word comes to us not, oh the message comes not only in word,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   it may come in circumstances.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   And yet men deliberately resist it.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Let me give you the one obvious example from the book of the Acts of the Apostles itself.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Later on you'll read about the apostle Paul, called one afternoon to speak
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   before the Roman governor called Felix and his wife Trusilla.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And Paul was speaking to them, filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   And he began to reason with them concerning righteousness and temperance
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and God is going to come.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   And this is what I'm told, as he spoke, Felix trembled.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   What made him tremble?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   That's the Holy Ghost, my friend.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   The Holy Spirit was using the apostle Paul, it wasn't merely Paul speaking.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   It was the Holy Spirit speaking through him and using him.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And the power was such that Felix was literally trembling.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And the power was such that within him, which was coming under the pressure
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   and the influence and the argument and the inevitability.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   But he deliberately stops the preaching.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And sends Paul back to the prison.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   That is resisting the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Don't we know something about this?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Haven't you felt, you one believer, haven't you felt at times
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   something of the power of these words?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Haven't you felt something suddenly moving your heart and spirit?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Haven't you felt something of the inevitability of this truth?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And you've been coming under its influence, but you don't want to.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And you look up, you pull out your hymn book, I've seen people doing it many a time.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Turn the leaves, look around at friends, smile, deliberately turn away.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Do you know what you're doing? You are resisting the Holy Ghost.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And doing it deliberately.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   And why do you do it? You do it because your will is the slave of the devil.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   And it is opposed to God.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And not only that, it's something that makes a man deliberately twist the very law of God.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And this is what the Pharisees have been doing.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   They've been deliberately twisting the law of God to suit themselves.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And evading it and avoiding it.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Glorying in it and praising it.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Opposed to men who seem to criticize it.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And yet they've never kept it, and they've been quite deliberate in what they're doing.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Hypocrisy.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   However, let us come to the last consideration.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And that is what sin, in the original form, have done to the heart of men.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And this is the most frightening and alarming and astonishing thing of all.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Have you ever realized, my friend, how utterly irrational unbelief is?
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Listen to these words.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And they gnashed them in with their teeth.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Then they cried with a loud voice and stopped their ears.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   And ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And the witnesses laid down their clowns at a young man's feet whose name was Saul.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And they stoned Stephen as he was calling upon God and saying,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And then he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. It makes no difference."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   What is this?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Well, here I say you have this extraordinary demonstration of the effect of sin upon the heart of men.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Unbelief, which likes to pride itself on its rationality and its intellectuality,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   is nothing but sheer irrationality.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   It is madness.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   It is sheer emotionalism.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   You see, it isn't the believer who suffers from emotionalism.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   It is the unbeliever.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Look at it. This is how it works.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   It starts with a kind of irritation against the truth, a general annoyance against it.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   This Christianity, they say.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   The derision, the scorn, the laughter, the jokes.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Haven't you seen it?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   You can see it whenever you like, almost on the television.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You can see it in the papers.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   These clever intellectuals, they're always poking fun of it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Now, this is emotional. This is pure emotionalism.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   They don't argue in rational terms.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   There are innuendos, suggestions, sneers, sarcasms, dismissal.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   There it is. This is irritation, going on to annoyance, going on to hatred,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   and ending in some shape or form, in violence.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Now, this is such a graphic description of it here.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   They don't want to hear it. They will not hear it.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   They must not.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Haven't you done this yourself?
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   You're refusing to listen, pushing your hands into your ears, as it were.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   You don't want to listen.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   This is the end of argument. It's the end of reason.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   It's the end of demonstration. It's the end of understanding.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It is a man deliberately abandoning himself to violence and emotion.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   But it is typical and characteristic of unbelief.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Haven't you noticed men who often start in an argument about religion and this faith,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   with supposed great intellectuality,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   have you noticed how if you go on quoting the scriptures and answering their objections and explaining this,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   they very soon begin to lose their temper, and they become impatient with you,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   and they get annoyed with you, and they walk out and say you're utterly unreasonable.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   They won't listen, and they treat you with sarcasm and scorn and derision.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Isn't that it?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Read the four Gospels.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Here is the very Son of God, the meek and lowly Jesus.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   How approachable, how ready to listen, how ready to help.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   But look at the attitude of the Pharisees and Scribes and Sadducees and Doctors of the Law to him.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Always trying to catch him, always trying to trip him and to be clever,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   taking up stones and throwing them at him, conspiring together against him,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   and finally crucifying him, putting him to death.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   What is it that made them do that?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   What harm had he done? What wrong had he done?
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   What was their wrong in his speech? What was their wrong in his actions?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   There was nothing. This is irrationality.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   They hate him without a cause, and they crucify him without any charge that they can bring against him.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   They subtle men, and here are these members of the Sanhedrin,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   doing exactly the same thing with this man, Stephen.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   There was nothing to be said against him.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   So they bribe men to tell lies, anything to put down this Christianity.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Is this rationality?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   It is sheer emotionalism and sheer irrationality.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   But you know, we've got the suggestion here of a still more remarkable case of what I'm talking about.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   They cast him out of the city and stoned him, and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Who was that? Well, that's the man who became the mighty apostle Paul.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   But at this point he was an unbeliever.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   And you want to know what an unbeliever is like? Here he is, this outstanding genius,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   this brilliant intellect, one of the greatest minds the world has ever known,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Saul of Tarsus, later Paul the apostle. Listen to how unbelief makes a man behave.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   went to the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogue,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   he might bring them down to Jerusalem, in order that they might be put to death.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   The giant intellect Paul. Here he is, breathing out threatenings and slaughter.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   What's this? It's madness. It is irrationality. It isn't intellect.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   It's a man moved by his emotions. He's mad.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Mad against God and his Son and the eternal truth.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   And as you read the story of the Christian church down the running centuries,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   you will find a constant repetition of this self-same thing.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   The way simple men were treated in this country at the time of the Protestant Reformation,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   simply because they had come to believe the truth, burnt at the stake in Smithfield.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   They'd never wronged anybody, indeed they were helping everybody,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   yet they're maligned, persecuted, put to death.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   The Puritans, the Covenanters, the early Methodists, look at the way they were treated.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   The hatred, the malice. Why? Simply because they'd become better people.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Because they'd stopped getting drunk, because they'd stopped swearing,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   because they were living a new and a holy life and were trying to help others.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   That's the treatment they get. Is this rationality?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   It is sure irrationality. It is nothing but terrible emotion.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   I think I may have told you once before of an example that I had of this once.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   I knew a man, in fact I had taken the wedding service when he and his wife got married,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   one of the first I ever took. Neither of them was a Christian.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   I wouldn't take that wedding now, but I took it then, I wasn't aware of what I was doing.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   But not long after that, the man was converted and was completely changed.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And because of that, of course, he lived now for coming to the meetings of the church.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   He was there, prayer meeting Monday night, fellowship meeting Wednesday night,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   men's theological discussion Saturday night, Sunday morning, afternoon and evening.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   It was everything to him. His wife was a very quiet woman, unusually quiet.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   But I'll never forget this man coming to tell me one day that he'd gone home one night from the prayer meeting
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   and his wife had received him with these words, with bitterness, not only in her heart but in her face.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   She said, "You've been to that prayer meeting again?" "Yes," he said.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   She said, "You know, I'd sooner that they brought you, they carried you home dead drunk
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   from the working men's drinking club than to see you coming home from this prayer meeting."
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   What causes this kind of thing? Why this bitterness? Why this mituperation?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Why this gnashing of the teeth? Why this stopping of the gears? She didn't want to hear about it.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Thank God she later was delivered from the fraud and of sin and Satan and she herself became a Christian.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   But at this point, there it was, she was an unbeliever.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Nothing that her husband said, nothing that anybody else said.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   And then she didn't want to hear about it. She thought it was all a lot of stuff and nonsense.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   She preferred him to be a drunkard. Anything but this.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Well, my friends, this is the nature and the character of unbelief.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   And this is the position of every unbeliever in the world tonight.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   It is that which leads men into this condition where the mind and the will and the heart are enslaved
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   and are incapable of recognizing the truth of God as it is in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Here is the blessed Son of God who thought it not robbery to be equal with God
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of men and humbled himself
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   and took upon him the form of a servant. Jesus, he is the eternal Son of God.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   He is the creator of the universe. He has come on earth, he has divested himself of the signs of his eternal glory
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   and he has come down into poverty and he has humbled himself. What for? In order to save us.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And yet in spite of the fact that he has done that and offers us free pardon and forgiveness
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   because he has borne the punishment of our sins in his own body on the tree
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   he stands before us and says, "Look unto me and be ye saved. Come to me and I will assure you that your sins are blotted out.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   I will give you new life, new hope, everything you can stand in need of and infinitely more.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Here it is, come unto me."
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   And man's response by nature is away with him, crucify him. He doesn't want him.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   Why is this, I ask? There is only one explanation.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   This, my dear friend, is the condition of men as the result of the fall.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   It is men in sin, it is men under condemnation, it is men under the dominion of the devil and of hell.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   You can't think straightly, that's why you see nothing in it.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   You don't want it, why not? This glorious gospel, why don't you want it?
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Can't you see there is something twisted in you? You are perverted.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   You prefer the ugly and the twisted to the pure and the clean and the holy and the lovely and the divine.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Can't you see that it's utter irrationality?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   And doesn't that lead you to this conclusion, that there is only one hope for you if you are in this position?
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And that is that you be born again.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   You can't do anything as you are, except to cry out to God to have mercy upon you.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Have you seen yourself? Have you seen the state of your mind, the state of your heart, the state of your will?
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Aren't you horrified, aren't you terrified?
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   If you are, cry out unto God to have mercy and to have pity.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   You can't do anything else, you can't believe as you are.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   You can simply ask for mercy and he'll give it to you and he'll put his spirit in you and you'll see the truth and then you'll believe it.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   We have received, says Paul, that's why we believe these things,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   the things that the princes of this world have rejected, which we believe.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   We believe them because we have received the spirit, not the spirit that is of the world, but the spirit that is of God,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   My dear friend, is there something in you at this moment which makes you feel, "Oh, I wish I could believe that"?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Well, very well, ask him to change your nature, to give you a new mind, a new heart, a new will.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   And then, to your own amazement and astonishment, you'll see the truth, you'll rejoice in believing it.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   You'll find you've got a heart that gladdens at the sound of it and a will which will be anxious to give yourself to him
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   and to live the remainder of your life in this world to his glory and to his praise.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   See unbelief as it's depicted in the Sanhedrin members, and it's in you,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   and God alone can deliver you out of it and from it.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   And that is precisely what the Lord Jesus Christ has come into this world to do.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Look unto him, cry out unto him to have mercy, and he will operate in you and will give you new life and all that accompanies it.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Amen.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
