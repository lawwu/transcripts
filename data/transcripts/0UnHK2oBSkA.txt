[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of the eighth Psalm,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.000]   Psalm number eight, which reads as follows.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.800]   O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.480]   who has set thy glory above the heavens.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.920]   Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.800]   because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.640]   the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.640]   what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of men that thou visitest him?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.040]   For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   and hast crowned him with glory and honor.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.760]   Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.560]   Thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.360]   yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.160]   and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.560]   O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   I want particularly to deal with verses three and four in this eighth psalm.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.160]   the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160]   what is man that thou art mindful of him,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.560]   and the son of men that thou visitest him?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.160]   I suppose that of all the charges that are brought against us who are Christian,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   is the charge that because we are Christian,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   we are men and women who do not think.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.560]   There are many charges brought against the Christian at the present time,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.160]   but I think this is perhaps the commonest.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560]   That we are people who don't think.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   We are little people who contract out of life as it were,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   and spend our time singing hymns and choruses and so on,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   and seem to be unaware of the great and marvellous things that are happening in the world outside us.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   This is the common view taken today of the Christian.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   And that is why he is a Christian, because he doesn't use his mind.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   He doesn't think, and he doesn't reason.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   Now I want to deal with that charge this evening,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   and I want to deal with it through the medium of this eighth psalm and its message.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   Why do you think it is that the men of the world, the men who are not a Christian,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   why is it that he holds this view of us, that we are people who don't think?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   I believe the answer to that is quite simple.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   He comes to that conclusion simply because we don't think as he thinks.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   And because we don't think in the way in which he thinks,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   he comes to the conclusion that we don't think at all.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Now this is a very important point, and to me in many ways,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   one of the most important things in life today.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   The way in which we think.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   What's the difference between the way in which the men of the world thinks
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   and in which the Christian thinks?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   And putting it briefly, we can put it like this.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   The men of the world thinks in a superficial manner.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   He is aware of things, he notices them, he reacts to them,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   but he soon forgets about them and reacts again to something else.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   And the thinking that he does is thinking that is controlled almost entirely
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   by the newspapers and by the television and by the wireless.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   I'm not saying this, prominent educationalists are saying it
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   and have said it for a number of years.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   I remember reading a book by a great professor on education in Oxford
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   during the last war, and he said then that it seems to me, he says,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.560]   that one of the main results of popular education since 1870 up to date
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   is to produce a mentality that can only appreciate Beaverbrook and Metro-Goldwyn.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   That was his way of putting it. I'm saying it in my way.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   That most people are controlled by what they hear on the wireless and the television
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560]   and what they read in the popular press.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   And the result of this is that their thinking is a light and a superficial thinking,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   a superficial reaction to the things that happen.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   What about the Christian?
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   Well, the Christian, you see, is entirely different.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   I asked my friend Mr. Sutton to read that second chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   because the great apostle sets it out there so plainly and so clearly.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   The Christian is a new man. He's born again.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   We have the mind of Christ, says Paul.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   We have received the spirit, not the spirit that is of the world,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   but the spirit that is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   It's a new way of thinking.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   The Christian is not merely a man whose sins are forgiven.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   He's a man who's born again. All things have become new.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   And one of the most important things is he's got a new mind.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   And he thinks in a different way.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   What is that?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   Well, that's the thing that comes out, it seems to me, in this old eighth psalm.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   It's all here in one word, really, in the third verse.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   "When I consider thy heavens," says the psalmist,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   he doesn't merely look at the heavens.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   He considers them.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   He goes on thinking, goes on looking.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   He asks questions, "What is man?" and so on.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.560]   He thinks deeply. He thinks profoundly.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   Why does he do this?
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   The answer is because his thinking is not determined by the newspapers and the popular media,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   but by the Bible.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   This is the truth about a Christian.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   His whole outlook is governed by the teaching of the scriptures.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   So he looks at everything in an entirely different way from the men who is not a Christian.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   Well, now then, bearing that in mind,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   let us look at this important subject together.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   And let's do so, I say, in terms of the teaching of this eighth psalm.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560]   Here's a man who says,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   "When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained."
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   He's a man who's looking up into the heavens at the sun and the moon and the stars.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   And he arrives at certain conclusions.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   Then the Christian and the non-Christian together look up at the same heavens,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   at the same moon, and at the same stars.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   But that has an entirely different effect upon them.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   And so you can discover whether you're a Christian or not,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   simply by asking yourself,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   "What effect does looking up at the heavens have upon me?"
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Now that's what we're going to consider together.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   And we're going to do so in a very modern way.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   I want to expand this message of this old eighth psalm to you
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   in the light of something of which we're all aware and in which we're tremendously interested.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   What is it?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   Well, we are living, are we not, in the days of astronauts.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   Everybody today is looking up at the heavens.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   We're all looking at the moon and the stars.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   It all began, as you remember, on the 20th of July in 1969,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   that never-to-be-forgotten day,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   when the Americans at long loss,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   and as the result of their brilliant technology,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.560]   succeeded in lending two men on the surface of the moon.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   It was a marvellous and amazing achievement.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.560]   And we were all looking up at the heavens,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   doing so perhaps through a television set,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   reading about it in the press.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   The whole world, in a sense, ever since,
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   has been looking up at the heavens,
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   at the moon and at the stars.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   Yes, but here's the question.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   What effect has that had upon you?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   And this is where we see the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   The Christian and non-Christian are looking up at the heavens.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   That's not confined to the non-Christian.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   The Christian reads his paper, he's interested in what's happening.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   They're all looking together at the heavens and the moon and the stars.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   Yes, but the vital question is, what effect has that had upon you?
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   What's it led to?
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   I want to show you the difference.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   And do you know, in doing that,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   we shall determine and decide tonight, beyond any question,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   whether we are Christians or whether we are not.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   Had you ever thought of that before?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   That the result of looking up at the heavens and the moon and the stars
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   proclaims whether you're a Christian or whether you're not a Christian.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.560]   You see, the non-Christian, he looks up and he gets excited.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   He says, "Isn't it marvellous? Isn't it wonderful?"
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   Then he forgets all about it.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   Looks at something else, gets excited about that,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   and on he goes from sensation to sensation.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   But the Christian, he stops.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   He considers.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   He meditates.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   He asks questions.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.560]   And he arrives at some of the profoundest conclusions
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   a man can ever arrive at in this world and in this life.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   What are these conclusions?
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   Let me explain them as this man puts them before us.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   The first conclusion at which the godly, the Christian man arrives
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   as he looks up at the heavens and the moon and the stars is this.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   The marvel and the wonder of creation.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   You notice how he starts his very psalm.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   who has set thy glory above the heavens."
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.560]   Marvels and wonders at the greatness and the glory of God's creation.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   But I can hear somebody saying immediately, "Wait a minute.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   Are you going to argue that it's only the Christian
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   who appreciates the greatness and the marvel of God's creation?"
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   "My dear sir," says this critic, "you can't get away with that.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.560]   For," he says, "I can prove to you, history proves,
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   that it's you Christians who've been the greatest opponents
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   of these marvelous discoveries.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   Christianity has been a kind of break upon the forward march of the human race.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   And it's only within the last century since people have thrown the Bible overboard
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   and have really begun to think for themselves that we're beginning to discover
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   the greatness and the marvel and the wonder of creation.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   You can't claim that it's you Christians who've discovered
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   the greatness and the marvel of creation.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   You've been the very people who prevented our seeing it
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   through putting blinkers round our eyes."
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   Now that's a very common argument, isn't it?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   You must have heard it many times.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   And they go on, of course, and produce their famous case.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   They say, "What about Galileo?"
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.560]   You know, this man Galileo, living at the end of the 16th century,
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.560]   this man, through looking through telescopes and making calculations,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   he discovered that what the church and others had always taught,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   namely that this planet on which we live is the center of the universe,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   he found this was quite wrong.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   And that it's the sun that's the center,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.560]   and that this is just some sort of planet circulating round the sun.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.560]   And he began to teach this. What happened to him?
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   The church tried to stop him, did stop him,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   persecuted him, punished him.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   Here it is, they say, this is what's always happened.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.560]   The church Christianity is always against the advance of science.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   And the proof is the case of Galileo.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   Now what do we say to that?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   Well, what we say to that is this,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.560]   that it's perfectly true to say that the church did persecute Galileo.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   But it is equally true to say that it was the Roman Catholic Church that did so.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   And I can tell you why she did so.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   It wasn't because his teaching contradicted the Bible.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   It was because his teaching contradicted the teaching
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   of a certain Greek philosopher of the name of Aristotle,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   whose philosophy had been mixed up with the Bible
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   in the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   Galileo was not against the Bible,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   but he was against the dogma
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   and the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.560]   That's why they persecuted him and silenced him.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   Now this is most important.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.560]   I'm not saying this, these are facts of history.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.560]   Indeed, most modern historians today are prepared to agree,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   and they're not Christians, most of them,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   most of them are prepared to agree
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   that what gave the greatest impetus
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   to scientific advance and development
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   was the Protestant Reformation.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   It read the minds of men of this incubus
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   of Roman Catholic teaching.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   It brought people back to the Bible itself.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   And so it gave this mighty stimulus to the whole of science.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   And if you go on to the next century,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   you'll find the same thing.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   People today denounce Puritanism and the period of the Commonwealth.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   And yet it is a simple fact to say
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   that the Royal Society,
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   and the greatest honor that scientists can have in this country today,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   is to be made a fellow of the Royal Society.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   The Royal Society came into being in the time of the Commonwealth.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   Again, secular historians pay tribute to this fact.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   So we must be clear about this.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   It isn't the true teaching of Christianity
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   that opposes science and scientific development.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   It's the false philosophy that the Roman Church had added,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   and still adds, to the plain teaching of the Scripture.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   However, let me put it like this to you.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   I'm arguing tonight that it is only the Christian
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.560]   who rarely sees the marvel and the glory and the wonder of creation.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   And I'll prove it like this to you.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   Go to a man who is not a Christian.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.560]   Let him be a great scientist, if you like, but he's not a Christian.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   And ask him to explain to you this marvelous universe in which we live.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.560]   Bring him up here,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   and ask him to look at this dale,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   the glory of nature,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   the mountains and the hills,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   the rivers and the streams and the valleys and the flowers and the animals,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   and ask him, "What is the explanation of all this?"
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   And he'll say, "Well, it's all an accident.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Originally there were some gases in outer space."
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   They don't tell you where the gases came from, but they say there were gases.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   And then they say that for some inexplicable reason
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   an explosion took place in the gases.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   And there was a great bang,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.560]   and the result of the explosion was some of these gases solidified.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   That's our universe.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   That's what they say.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   The greatest scientists.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   It's the result of a pure accident.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   No design, no order, no arrangement whatsoever.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.560]   That's their teaching.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   All blind chance.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.560]   Now I suggest to you that a view like that
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.560]   doesn't begin to appreciate the greatness and the marvel
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   and the wonder of creation.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   You see, it takes the Christian to see that.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   He looks at it all,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   and he says, "How marvelous!
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   Here we are every year, spring, summer, autumn, winter.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   Look at the flowers.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   Look at the perfection of the arrangement.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   Is all this accident?
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   Is all this chance?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   Has all this just happened?"
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   He says, "It's impossible."
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   "What is it then?"
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   "Oh," he says, "there must be somebody who has produced it all."
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   And the psalmist says it.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   "When I consider thy heavens,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   the work of thy fingers,
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   not accident and chance,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   but a creator."
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   The first verse in the Bible, in the beginning,
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   "God created."
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   And this makes sense, doesn't it?
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   You see the explanation.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.560]   And of course, some of the very greatest scientists
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   have been ready to admit this.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   Take a man like the late Sir James Jeans.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   He said at the end of his long life
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   that the result of a lifetime of experimental research in science
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   had driven him to this conclusion,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   that there must be a great mind at the back of the universe.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   He went further.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   He said, "God must be a great mathematician."
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   And if he could say that then,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   before these astronauts landed on the moon,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   how much more so now?
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   Look at it, my friends.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   It's all very well to say,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   you look at the two men walking on the moon,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   and you say, "Isn't science marvelous?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   Thank God we got rid of the Bible.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   We are no longer religious.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   Here's science. We are advancing.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Marvelous. Wonderful."
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   But wait a minute.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   How did they ever get there?
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   I'll tell you how they got there.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.560]   They got there because this universe is so made
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   that you can rely upon certain facts.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.560]   There are what are called the laws of nature.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.560]   Who put them there?
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   Man didn't.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   Man's only discovered them.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   He didn't create them.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   God put them there.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   And you know, these men would never have been able to arrive
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   on the surface of the moon
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.560]   were it not that you can rely absolutely upon this order in creation.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   They built upon this.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   And that is the explanation of their success.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   You see, it's only the men who begins to think and to meditate.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   Not the men who gets excited on the surface,
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   but the men who goes on considering it all.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   Did you know this, for instance?
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   If only this planet on which you and I are living
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.560]   were a very, very tiny distance nearer to the sun,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.560]   we'd all be burnt up immediately.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   If it were only the same tiny distance farther away from the sun,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   we'd all freeze up immediately.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.560]   This planet is at the particular spot which makes life possible.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   And another thing I can tell you.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   If the angle between this earth and the moon were not what it is,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   to the smallest detail, those men would never have landed on the moon.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   So, we are asked to believe, you see, by modern science and clever people,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   that all this is an accident.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   The thing is ridiculous, my friends.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   No, no.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   The man who only sees the marvel and the glory and the wonder of it all
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.560]   is the man who says, "The more I look at it, the more I consider it,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   the more I see this great mind.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   I see the fingers, the fingers of God, making, manipulating,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   putting everything in order.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   How marvelous it all is."
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   Have you come to that conclusion?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   Tell me.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   When you saw those two men walking on the surface of the moon
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   in your television set,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   did you just say, "How wonderful and marvelous"?
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   Or did you go on looking and thinking and saying,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.560]   "What made that possible?
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.560]   What a marvelous thing this universe is.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   What a design, what a plan,
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   what perfection in every detailed arrangement.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560]   What is it?"
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   And you fell on your knees and you said,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   "Oh, Lord, our Lord.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   How marvelous is Thy name."
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   If you didn't come to that conclusion,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   you are not a thinker.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   You're a superficial reactor.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   You're simply repeating phrases and carried away by the latest event.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   Well, now, there's this man's first conclusion.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   But let's go on to his second conclusion.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   His second conclusion is the uniqueness and the greatness of man.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   "When I consider Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained,
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   what is man that Thou art mindful of him,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   or the son of men that Thou visitest him?"
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   The uniqueness and the greatness of man.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   He's looked at the marvelous universe,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   He then looks at man and asks this profound question.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.560]   What is man?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   How marvelous, how wonderful.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.560]   But again, I can hear the critic saying,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.560]   "No, no, you're not going to get away with that either.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.560]   You mustn't say that you Christians are the only people
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   who have the true idea of the greatness and the uniqueness of man,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   because again, it is surely a fact to say
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   that nothing has kept man back and down so much as religion and Christianity.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   It's been the dope of the people, the opiate of the masses.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.560]   There it's been holding us back, but thank God, last century,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   we got rid of all this, and man has come to his own,
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.560]   and we now see men for what he is.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   Men come of age, men grown up.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   What a wonderful creature man is, and look at his achievements.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   It's science, it's this non-Christian view
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   that really has discovered the uniqueness and the greatness of man.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   That's the argument.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   Well, now, how do we meet that?
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   Well, again, we meet it in very much the same way.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   We turn to this friend, and we say, "All right.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   How do you explain men?
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.560]   You're boasting about men.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   You say we don't need God any longer because men's are marvelous.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   But what is men? Where has he come from?
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   How has he come into being?
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   Where has he got these wonderful powers and propensities?"
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   And the answer he gives you is this,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   that as the whole universe is an accident, so is man.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.560]   Man, they say, is a creature that has developed and evolved
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   out of nothing, out of some primitive slime,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   some one cell, undifferentiated matter.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   That's what they say.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   There was just this slime, this undifferentiated matter,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   and then for some reason or another, that decided to divide
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   and became more complex, and then that divided again.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   Why, nobody knows. Accident, chance, blind forces.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   And on and on it goes until you come to the animals.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   Then you go up through the animals, you come to the apes,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   final step, man.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   Now, this is the serious teaching that is being offered today
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   as against the biblical view of men,
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   that man is a pure accident,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   and that there's no other explanation of him.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   But, my dear friends, this surely is something
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   which is quite unacceptable.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   Surely reason can't accept this.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   These very astronauts, this very achievement of men,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   surely demonstrates that this can't be an accident.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   It can't be the result of some kind of blind chance.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.560]   Man is too big for that.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   His achievements are too great.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   How do you explain that?
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   And here, you see, you've got to come back
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   to the biblical explanation as put by this old psalmist
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   in this eighth psalm.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   He asks his question, "What is man?"
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   And then he answers it.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   "For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   and hast crowned him with glory and honor.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   Thou hast put all things under his feet.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   Thou, all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   and the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea."
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.560]   What is man?
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   And the answer is, he is not an accident.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   Man is a creature made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   God said, "Let us make man in our own image and likeness."
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   He's not an animal only.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   He has an animal part, but he's bigger.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   God said, "Let's put something of ourselves in this one.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   This man is going to be our representative.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.560]   We'll make him just a little lower than the angels.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   We'll make him the Lord of creation."
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   And isn't this true?
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   How weak man appears to be when you compare him with a lion
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   or a bear or some such animal.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   How helpless man seems to be compared with the mighty ocean waves
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   or with the pull of gravity.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   But he's bigger than them.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   He's the Lord of creation.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   He can tame the lion and the bear.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   He can master the ocean.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   He's even conquered the force of gravity.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   How? Accident? Of course not.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   He has a mind. He has a reason.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.560]   These are God-given. God has made him.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   And he is here as the Lord of creation
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   and the representative of the Almighty
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   in this creation and in this world of time.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   No other view of man is adequate to explain
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   these astounding achievements of modern man.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   This cannot be an accident.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   It's too perfect. It's too wonderful.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.560]   Man has made these amazing discoveries.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   And the explanation is that he is a creature made
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   in the image and likeness of God.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.560]   Very well. I ask my second question.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   You've looked up at the moon and the stars.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   You've seen the astronauts walking on the surface of that moon.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   What did it lead to?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   How did you react to it?
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.560]   Did you just say, "How marvelous, how wonderful.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.560]   Thank God we got rid of religion."
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   And then run to the next excitement.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   Or did you go on looking?
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   And did you end by asking, "What is man?
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   What is this little creature that is so capable
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.560]   of even conquering the force of gravity
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   and the pull of the moon
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   and landing men there on that very surface?
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   How marvelous is man.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   How unique a being is man."
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   Did you arrive at that conclusion?
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   If not, I say again, you're not a thinker.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.560]   You're just repeating glibly the phrases that you read
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   and that you hear. You've never considered it all.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.560]   And asked the right questions and arrived at the profound conclusions.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   But let me hurry on to this man's third conclusion.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   And his third conclusion is this.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   The problem and the tragedy of man.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   Now this is amazing, isn't it?
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   We've seen the marvel and the wonder of creation.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.560]   We've seen the uniqueness and the greatness of man.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.560]   But now he comes to the problem and the tragedy of man.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.560]   He puts it like this.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   "What is man that thou art mindful of him
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.560]   and the son of men that thou visitest him?"
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]   What he means is this.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   There's something wrong with men.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   Why does God need to be mindful of men?
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   Why does God need to visit men?
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   And the answer is because men has become a problem.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.560]   You see, the whole truth about men
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.560]   is not simply that he's conquered the force of gravity
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   and landed two astronauts on the surface of the moon.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   That's not the whole truth.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   You know the other part of the truth?
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   It's the modern world.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   And here you see the problem.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   You look up at the heavens and at the astronauts and you say,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   "How marvelous man is and how wonderful are his achievements."
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   But then you look at the world as it is tonight
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   with trouble in Northern Ireland,
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   apartheid in South Africa,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   rumors of wars, infidelity, divorce, theft, robbery, malice, hatred,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   the whole tragedy of the modern world,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.560]   the sensationalism of the last fortnight,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   the failure of great leaders,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   and you say, "What is man?
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   He's such a brilliant success on the one hand,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   but he's such an appalling failure on the other.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.560]   He can conquer the force of gravity, but he can't control himself.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   What's the matter with man?
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.560]   The problem and the tragedy of man.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   Have you considered this, my friends?
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   For this, it seems to me, is something that ought to be in the mind
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   and heart of every one of us at this present time.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   Nothing is so obvious in the modern world as the fact that man is a problem.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   He's a mass of contradictions.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   Here he is, I say, brilliant success, tragic failure.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   He can do almost anything.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   He can't do the most ordinary things.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   What's the matter with him?
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   And here, I say, is the very essence of our problem.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   Man is a mass of contradictions.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   I'd like to show you this.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.560]   As I do so, let me tell you that something that happened in my experience,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.560]   it illustrates what I'm saying so perfectly.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   I happened to be in America on July the 20th, 1969, on that great day.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   And I'll never forget getting down to breakfast the next morning, the Monday morning.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   And there, of course, was the newspaper.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.560]   And as anticipated, in bold type on the left-hand side,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   the astronauts, man on the moon, and the photographs.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   This amazing achievement.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   And there it was, standing out.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.560]   But it wasn't the only thing on that front page.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.560]   Please turn your cassette over at this point.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   On the same front page, on the right-hand side, in equally bold type,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   there was the announcement of the death of a poor secretary girl
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   in the motorcar of Senator Edward Kennedy in a lake in New England.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   On the same front page, brilliant success, problem, tragedy, failure, moral muddle.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   Same page. That's modern men.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   You mustn't only look at one side, the brilliant achievement.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   There's this other side.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   Man is a mass of contradictions. Let me show it to you.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.560]   I think you'll all agree with me when I say that
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   the great thing that impressed us all about these astronauts
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   was their amazing discipline.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.560]   You read about them, didn't you? You've heard about them.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   They're still doing this kind of thing.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   How did those astronauts get up there?
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   Well, the explanation was that they underwent very rigorous training
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.560]   for a very long time.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   They gave up drink, alcohol.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   They gave up tobacco, smoking.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   They ceased to live with their wives at a certain point.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   And they underwent this most rigorous training
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   in order to land on the surface of the moon.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   Now, here's my question.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   If man is prepared to discipline himself to that extent
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.560]   in order to work on the surface of the moon,
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   why can't he use the same discipline in the matter of his married life,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   his home life, the temptations of the call girls,
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   and all the moral muddle of this world of ours?
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.560]   If he can do it there, why doesn't he do it here?
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   If he can land on the moon, why doesn't he make a perfect world?
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.560]   Why not get rid of sin?
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   Why not live a decent and a true and a noble life?
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   That's the question.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   Modern man, you see, is a mess of contradictions.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   And this is so obvious in many respects.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   One respect is this.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   Modern man is a great hero worshipper, isn't he?
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   It's a characteristic of the age.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   We're interested in what are called personalities.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   It's the great word of today, isn't it?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560]   Personality.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.560]   They talk about television personalities.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   They seem to me to be grinning ninnies, but that doesn't matter.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   They're called television personality.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   And you read about people, they'll stand in the rain for hours
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   to have a passing glimpse of one of these little television personalities,
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   or a pop star, or some such ridiculous person.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.560]   Personalities.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.560]   Modern man is tremendously interested in personality, he says.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   And yet when you ask him to look at the greatest personality
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   this world has ever seen or ever will see,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   he turns his head away in disgust.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   He won't even look at him.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   Interested in personality, won't look at the greatest personality.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   What else?
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.560]   Modern man's very interested in exciting events.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   Anything unusual that happens, he's interested, he's keyed up,
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.560]   and he wants to hear all about it.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.560]   And the media go on repeating it ad nauseum.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   Some remarkable event.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   All right, there's nothing wrong in this.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   But all I want to know is this.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.560]   If modern man is so interested in great and cataclysmic events,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.560]   why isn't he interested in the greatest event
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.560]   that has ever happened in history or ever can happen?
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   The death of the Son of God on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   The maker of the universe dying.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   The Lord of life expiring.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   What an event!
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.560]   But the modern world says, "I couldn't care less."
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   It's not interested.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.560]   It passes it by with continuity and with scorn.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.560]   There are the contradictions in man.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   And so the psalmist asks this question,
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   "What's the matter with men?"
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   My friend, have you asked that question?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Here's the test of whether you're a thinker or not
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   and whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   You can look at the sun and the moon and the stars
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   and the heavens and the astronauts.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   Any fool can do that. But what's it lead to?
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.560]   Did it make you consider and think and ponder
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   and say, "In the light of this, why is the world as it is?
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   What's the matter with men?"
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   If it hasn't brought you to that, you don't think.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   You have no right to call yourself a thinker.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   You're just a superficial reactor.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.560]   And you know, there's only one answer to this question
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   of what is wrong with men.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   Science can't answer it.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   Philosophy can't answer it.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   The learning and the law of the world
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   can't answer it altogether.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   There is only one answer, and it is this.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.560]   Man was made in the image and likeness of God.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   Hence his brilliance.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.560]   Hence his marvelous achievements.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   Well, then, why is the world as it is?
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   It is because men in his folly
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   rebelled against his own maker and creator,
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   his own greatest benefactor.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   In his pride, he lifted himself up, and he fell.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   And he became the slave of the devil
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   and of the world and the flesh
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   and of his own lusts and passions.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   And here he is, a contradiction.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.560]   He may be a great man and a great statesman,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   yet he's the creature of lust and passion
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.560]   that ruins everything.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   It's the only explanation, the fall of men.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   Adam and Eve, defying God,
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.560]   listening to the devil, and they fell.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   And the whole of humanity has been fallen
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.560]   ever since in utter hopelessness
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   and constant contradiction.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.560]   What's the matter with men?
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   And that is the only adequate explanation.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   And that, in turn, brings me to this man's last conclusion.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   And thank God for it.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   Were it not for this last conclusion,
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   we wouldn't be here tonight.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   And there'd be no hope in this world.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   This man's last conclusion is this.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   There is only one hope for men,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.560]   one hope for the world, literally.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   And I'm here to proclaim this.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   And I'm here to defy the world.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   Christian people, we have a unique opportunity today.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   The world is manifesting its failure.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.560]   These last weeks have shown us the utter failure of men,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   the folly of men, the contradiction of men,
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.560]   the utter helplessness of men,
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   in the grip of the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   There's literally only one hope.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   It isn't in science, it isn't in philosophy,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   it isn't in education. We've had all this.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   It isn't in the books and the journals.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   It isn't in the television. What is it?
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.560]   And here he puts it.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.560]   "What is man,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.560]   that thou art mindful of him,
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   and the son of men,
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   that thou visitest him?"
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   My dear friends, the only hope for the world tonight is this,
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   that it's God's world.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.560]   He hasn't abandoned it.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   He is still mindful of it, which means this.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   He's concerned, he's interested, he thinks.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.560]   He has a plan for it.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   The only hope for this world and for any individual in it tonight
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   is that God is concerned,
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   and tremendously concerned.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.560]   He's mindful of it.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   More than that, that he's visited it.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   You remember how old Zacharias,
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   the father of John the Baptist, put it?
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   God, he says, has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   The only hope for the world tonight is this,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   is that it's God's world,
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   and that even before he created it,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   and before men fell,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   God had a plan of salvation.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   He planned it out in eternity before time.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   He prepared the way of salvation,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   and its essence is that he sent his only begotten son
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   into the world to visit it,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   and to redeem it.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.560]   And he has come.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   Why did he ever come?
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.560]   Well, this is the marvelous thing.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.560]   He came, he said, to seek and to save
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   that which is lost.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.560]   And he has done so.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.560]   He gave himself, his life, his soul,
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   a ransom for many.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   He bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.560]   thereby reconciling us to God.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   He's conquered our enemies.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560]   He's risen again.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   He's seated at the right hand of God.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   He'll come again, conquering and to conquer,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   to destroy all his enemies,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   and set up his glorious kingdom
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.560]   of righteousness, peace, and truth,
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   and joy everlasting.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   That's the message.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   It's the only hope for the world.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.560]   Is there any other?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   Do you people still believe in politicians?
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   I'm old enough to remember
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   when men virtually worshipped politicians.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   I remember hearing a man saying quite seriously
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   to my own father,
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   when I was a boy,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   I won't tell you my age,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   I won't tell you the date,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   or I'll tell you my age,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   but I happened to be in a trap with my father,
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   and we gave a lift to a man.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   And Lloyd George had just been introducing
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.560]   his famous 1909 budget.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.560]   And this man said to my father,
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   he said, "You know, this man is going to do
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   much greater good than Jesus Christ."
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.560]   And they worshipped politicians.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.560]   And I have an uncomfortable feeling
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   that non-conformity and our churches in general
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   tonight are as they are
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   because our foolish forefathers
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   ceased to worship God
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   and began to worship politicians.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.560]   They said, "You don't need your old gospel of salvation.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.560]   You need acts of parliament
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.560]   and you'll make a new world."
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   Tennyson sang about the parliament of men
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   and the federation of the world.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   Things were evolving and developing.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.560]   You didn't need the Bible.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   You didn't need Christ.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   You didn't need God.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.560]   Oh, the tragedy of it all.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   But I don't think many people
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.560]   believe things like that tonight, do they?
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   We are living in a disillusioned
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.560]   and in a cynical world.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.560]   And therein I see the hope.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.560]   Everything is failing.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   Who can you trust?
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   There's only one hope.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   It's this blessed,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   it is this glorious gospel.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   It is the old, old story
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.560]   which is ever new and ever true.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   Shall I close by putting this old gospel message
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   in a very modern form?
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   People say we must be modern and up to date.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   All right, we can do it.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   Let me put this old message
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   in a very modern form.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   Do you know literally what is the only hope
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   in this world tonight?
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   I can tell you.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   It consists in a series of launchings
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   Launching? What's a launching?
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.560]   Well, everybody knows what a launching is.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   You've read about it, haven't you?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.560]   How these men go to Cape Kennedy.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   I think they've changed it back
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.560]   to its old name again now.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   Doesn't matter, it was called Cape Kennedy.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   And then you read about these men
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.560]   who've been preparing for months
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.560]   and perhaps for years.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   They now decide on a given date
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   to enter into a capsule or a nodule.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   And they're then going to start
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   on their great journey to the moon.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   And the great day when the journey begins
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   is known as the launching day.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   And do you remember what happens?
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   The men go in, they shut the door
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   and seal it off.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   Then a rocket is set going beneath the capsule.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   And up it goes with this tremendous
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   power of propulsion.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.560]   We see it going up through the skies,
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   on and on and on it goes,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   until eventually the men land
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   on the surface of the moon.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   The launching day.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   And everybody's talking about these
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   marvellous launchings.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560]   Do you know the only hope
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   for this world tonight?
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   It's in a series of launchings.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.560]   Do you know what the first was?
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   Well, the Apostle Paul put it like this.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   When the fullness of the times was come,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   God sent forth his Son, launched him.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   Not from earth to heaven,
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   but from heaven to earth.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.560]   God sent forth his Son.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   How did he launch him?
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.560]   How did the Son of God ever come
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   from heaven to earth?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   It was in a capsule, wasn't it?
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   The Virgin's womb.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   The eternal Son of God
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   went into that little capsule,
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   the Virgin's womb.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   And as those astronauts
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   come out of the capsule
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   and walk on the surface of the moon,
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   Jesus Christ came out of the Virgin's womb
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   and began to walk back and forth
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.560]   on the surface of this earth,
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   this world, this planet
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   on which you and I live.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   Why has he come?
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.560]   Why did he come?
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   Well, why do the astronauts
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   go up onto the moon?
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   Well, you know the answer.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   They go there to make scientific reports
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   and investigations.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   They gather specimens of dust
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   and bits of rock
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   and do many other things.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560]   And they come back
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   and they present their wonderful report.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   Why did the Son of God
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   ever come into this world?
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.560]   Was it in order to make a report on us?
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.560]   Was it in order to collect
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   certain specimens
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560]   and take them back
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560]   to the courts of heaven?
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   Thank God it wasn't.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   He came to save us.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   He came to deliver us
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   from the bondage of sin and Satan.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   He came to reconcile us unto God.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   He was launched from heaven to earth
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   and came out of the Virgin's womb
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   on the face of this earth
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.560]   in order that he might redeem us
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   and reconcile us to God
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   and make us children
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   and join us with Christ.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   The first launching.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   But as you know,
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   doing this in this world
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.560]   cost him his life.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   They rejected him.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   They crucified him.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   And they buried him in a grave.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   He's in another capsule, isn't he?
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   He's entombed.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   He's encapsulated
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   in a grave.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   Is that the end of the story?
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.560]   Thank God it isn't.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   On the morning of the third day,
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   God put the rocket of the resurrection
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   underneath his capsule
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   and it burst asunder.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   He burst asunder the bands of death.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   He began to rise.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   He manifested himself
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   to various chosen witnesses
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   for 40 days
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.560]   and he ascended into heaven
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.560]   in the sight of some of them,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.560]   launched again,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   passed through the heavens
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   and took his seat
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   on the right hand of the glory
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   in the majesty on high.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   And there he sits
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   and there he reigns
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   until he's launched again.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   And this time,
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   it won't be in a capsule.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   It won't be the virgin's womb.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   There'll be no death.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   He will come
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Surrounded by the holy angels,
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   king of kings,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   lord of lords,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.560]   he'll come conquering and to conquer
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.560]   and he'll judge the whole world
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   in righteousness.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   And all who've not believed in him,
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.560]   he will consign to eternal misery
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   and perdition.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   And all who've believed in him,
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   he'll gather unto himself
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.560]   they'll be changed and glorified
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   and they'll live and reign with him
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.560]   in the glory everlasting.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   That's the message.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   It's a series of launching
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   of the blessed,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   eternal son of God.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.560]   My friend,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   did looking up at those astronauts
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   make you think in this way
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   and arrive at these conclusions?
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   I can hear somebody saying,
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.560]   "Certainly not."
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.560]   "Certainly not and why should it?"
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   I've no doubt you're interested
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   in some old people
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   who are listening to you tonight.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   But I'm a modern young person.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   I'm not interested in your launching.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.560]   Aren't you?
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560]   Well, my friend, it's about time
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.560]   you became interested in launching.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.560]   Do you know why?
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   It is because a day will come
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   quite soon in your life and story
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   when you are going to be launched.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   You're a modern man, all right.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   You're living in the days of science,
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   in the atomic age.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   You know so much
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   and you're not interested in the Bible
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   and in Christianity.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   You say, "All this is entirely irrelevant."
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Is it?
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   You've got to die, my friend.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   A day is coming when the rocket of death
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   will be placed beneath your capsule
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.560]   that you're living in.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   This body is but a capsule.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   And when the rocket of death
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   is set beneath it,
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   your spirit, your soul,
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   will go out of it
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   and you'll ascend.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   You'll pass through the heavens
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   and you'll stand in the presence of God.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   This is the message of the Bible
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.560]   from beginning to end.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   It is appointed unto all men once to die
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   and after death, the judgment.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.560]   And however much you may know
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   and whatever you may think,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.560]   you can't evade it, you can't avoid it.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   National health services have not abolished death
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   and never will.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   We've all got to be launched.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   We've all got to leave this world
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   and all who are around us
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   and we'll pass through the heaven.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   And there stand before God
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   in the last asylum.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   Tell me, my friend,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   have you ever thought about that?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   You got very excited about the astronauts,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   didn't you?
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   Yes, but you know this,
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   those men would never land
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   on the surface of the moon
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   were it not for very careful,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.560]   very minute,
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   and very meticulous preparation.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.560]   Think of the heat of the sun
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.560]   blazing upon that little capsule.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.560]   Think of the power and the heat
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   of the rocket that sends it up.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   It's got to be strong enough to withstand this.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   And then it begins to move.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   Meteorites may hit into it.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   And on and on it goes
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   and there's the pull of gravity
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.560]   and then the sun
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.560]   and various other hazards.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   You know these marvelous scientists,
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   they've catered for every one of them,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   hence the success of the project.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   They've spent years in visualizing
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   and contemplating everything
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   that can conceivably happen
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.560]   and they've answered it.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.560]   The capsule is so made
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.560]   that the blazing heat of the sun
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   doesn't scorch it up.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   They've got a problem in this respect
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   at this moment, haven't they?
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   And they're solving it as they will.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.560]   They've made all these meticulous,
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   minute preparations.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   Have you made any preparation
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   for your launching?
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   It's going to happen
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   and you can't evade it or avoid it.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   Tell me, have you made any calculations?
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   Have you ever contemplated
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   how you were going to deal with
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   the blazing heat of the holiness of God?
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   How are you going to do it?
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   You'll have to.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   How are you going to answer
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   the Ten Commandments and their accusations?
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   How are you going to deal
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   with the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   How are you going to deal
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   with the lives of the saints?
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   They'll be there facing you,
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   there in the glory.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   Why not you?
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   You've got to answer these.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   These are the things
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   that are certainly going to happen to us.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   Have you made any preparation?
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.560]   If you haven't, you're not a thinker.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   You're the biggest fool in the universe.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   To go on living day by day
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   with this certain fact of death,
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   without making any provision or preparation,
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   it is sheer lunacy.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.560]   It's the absence of thinking.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   And let me show you
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   why there are two reasons
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   why you and I
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   should be much more urgent
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   about this preparation
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   than those astronauts have ever been.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.560]   What are they?
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   Well, here's the first.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   In the case of the astronauts,
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   the day of the launching,
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.560]   the exact time of the launching,
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   is always known well ahead of time.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.560]   If I remember rightly,
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   in the first instance,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   we were told six months
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   before the launching,
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   the exact date of the launching,
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   and the very moment
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   when they'd arrive
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.560]   on the surface of the moon.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   That's true, isn't it?
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Do you know the date of your launching?
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   You don't.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   You never know when it's going to come.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   You may be young, yes,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   but youth is no respecter of viruses
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.560]   and certain other lethal diseases.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   You may have to go at any moment,
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.560]   and yet you've made no preparation.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.560]   That's one difference.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   And then there's a second difference.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   You remember how, don't you,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.560]   in the case of the astronauts,
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.560]   some experiments that they made went wrong.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   Do you remember that tragic event
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.560]   just about a year before July 20, 1969?
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.560]   Three unfortunate astronauts
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   went into a capsule, into a nodule.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   The rocket was set off,
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.560]   and the poor men were immediately burned to death.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   But that didn't put an end to the project, no, no.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   Science is trial and error.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   Something goes wrong,
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   you correct it and put it right,
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.560]   and you try again,
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.560]   and you go on repeating the experiment
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.560]   until at last it's all right,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   and the two men land on the surface of the moon.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.560]   Many, many trials.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   But my dear friend,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   in your case and mine,
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   there's no second chance.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   Our eternal destiny is decided in this world.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   It's either to be with God in the glory indescribable,
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   or it's to be in eternal misery and wretchedness
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.560]   and useless remorse forever and forever.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.560]   And it is entirely decided
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   in this world.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   If you die in your sins,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   there's no second chance,
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.560]   no second opportunity.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   Once and once only.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   In the name of God, I ask you,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   have you made any preparation
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   for your launching?
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.560]   Have you ever considered
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   how you are to give an account of your life and your soul
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.560]   to the God who made you
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.560]   and who has so blessed you in spite of your rebellion?
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.560]   Are you ready to meet him?
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   If not, I say,
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   don't talk to me about thinking.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   You haven't started to think.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.560]   The fear of the Lord
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   Have you thought about it?
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   "Oh," says someone, "what's the use of saying that?
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.560]   I see now that God is so holy and so perfect,
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   and I am so sinful that if I had an eternity to prepare,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   I could never do it."
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.560]   You're perfectly right.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.560]   You're perfectly right.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy Lord's demands.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   Could my zeal nor respite know.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   Could my tears forever flow.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.560]   Thou must save,
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.560]   and thou alone,
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.560]   and blessed be his name, he's done so."
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.560]   You and I can never make the preparation,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.560]   but you know God, in his infinite love,
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   has already made it for us.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   He's already provided a capsule.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.560]   The nodule is there.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   Jesus Christ, he's God's capsule,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:56.560]   that will take us to heaven, whatever may happen to us.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   And all you and I have to do
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.560]   is to confess and acknowledge our sin,
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   see our utter and complete hopelessness,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   and step into the nodule,
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.560]   enter into Christ,
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   and there you are eternally safe.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.560]   My dear friend, this is the glory of this gospel.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.560]   That what is impossible with men,
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.560]   is possible with God.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.560]   And God sent his only son into the world
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   in order that we might be in him,
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.560]   and in Christ.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.560]   We are everlastingly safe.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Safe in time, safe in death, safe in eternity.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.560]   And we can say, can't we not,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.560]   with Augustus Toplady,
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   the terrors of law and of God,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   with me can have nothing to do.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.560]   My savior's obedience and blood
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   hide all my transgressions from view.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   Safe in the arms of Jesus,
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   safe on his gentle breast.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   Are you there, my dear friend?
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   Let me plead with you.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.560]   Before it is too late,
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   the door of the capsule is still open.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   Enter in,
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.560]   and be eternally safe.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   And then, you'll be ready to join with me in singing
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.560]   some of these great old hymns.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.560]   You know, I've discovered in these last years
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   that some of these old hymn writers of 200 years ago
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   seem to have some prophetic insight
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   into this launching that's taking place.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   Have you ever noticed this in the hymn that I've just quoted?
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   Augustus Toplady's Rock of Ages.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   Do you remember his last verse?
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   Listen to him.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.560]   While I draw this fleeting breath,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   when mine eyes shall close in death,
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   listen,
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.560]   when I soar through tracts unknown,
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   he's been launched,
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.560]   he's passing up,
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.560]   through tracts unknown,
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   see thee on thy judgment throne
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   rock of ages cleft for me.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.560]   Let me hide myself in thee.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.560]   So sang the Calvinist Augustus Toplady.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.560]   But he'd got a contemporary,
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.560]   and they argued violently.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   A great Arminian, Thomas Olivers.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.560]   But you know, at this point, they say exactly the same thing.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.560]   You know the great hymn,
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.560]   The God of Abraham Prayers?
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   Listen to Thomas Olivers.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   He by himself hath sworn
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.560]   I on his oath depend,
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   I shall on eagles' wings
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   are born to heaven ascend.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   He's going to be launched,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   but he's quite safe.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   The eagle wings will hold him up.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   I shall behold his face.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.560]   I shall his power adore,
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   and sing the wonders of his grace forevermore.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   And then a woman put it so perfectly.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.560]   Listen to her.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.560]   All the way my Savior leads me,
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.560]   all the fullness of his love.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   Perfect rest to me is promised
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   in my Father's house above.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.560]   Listen.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.560]   When my spirit, clothed immortal,
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   wings its flight to realms of day.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.560]   She'd anticipated all this.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   This shall be my endless story.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:24.560]   Jesus led me all the way.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.560]   Are you being led by him?
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   While there is still time,
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   become encapsulated in Christ,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.560]   and thereby be safe and saved
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.560]   for time and for eternity.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   Let us pray.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   O Lord our God,
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.560]   like thy servant the psalmist of old,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   we are amazed that thou art still mindful of us,
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.560]   and that thou didst ever visit us
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   in thine only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   We are unworthy of the very least of thy mercies.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.560]   We are proud and arrogant and boastful,
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   and yet we are utterly and completely helpless
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.560]   and hopeless and vile.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.560]   And we realize our only hope this evening
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.560]   is thine amazing grace.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   O God, we thank thee that thou hast ever
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   opened our eyes to have but a glimpse of it.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   And should there be anybody present here tonight
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   who has never seen it,
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   Lord, have mercy.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   Thou alone canst open the eyes of the blind.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   None other can do this.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   Have mercy, we humbly pray thee.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   God save the people.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   And unto thee, and unto thee alone
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   shall we give all the praise and all the honor
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   and all the glory, both now and forever.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   Amen.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
