[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones needs no introduction from me and he has already given his first
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.320]   exposition yesterday evening on the wonderful works of God, reminding us that God is active
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.240]   and concerned in the affairs of men and intervenes in history and in his Church.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   He is to give us a second of these talks now on the supernatural in relation to the practice
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.160]   of medicine and I'm not going to take any more of his time than yours but ask him to
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   speak to us.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.360]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   The title for this morning's address is somewhat pretentious and I hope it hasn't misled anybody.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.360]   I've always had a kind of constitutional difficulty about choosing titles for sermons or for addresses.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.760]   In fact, I've never been able to do it and this present title is the result mainly of
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.680]   the ingenuity of the General Secretary who thought that this would give me a right to
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.800]   do almost anything I chose and not for the first time I'm extremely grateful to him.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.400]   What I really want to try to do is this.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.480]   I feel that the time has come when we should reconsider some of our established attitudes
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.360]   towards elements in life and practice, both of the Christian in general and of the medical
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.720]   Christian in particular, where certain difficulties arise.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.680]   And I want in particular to have another look with you at the whole question of what is
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.760]   called faith healing or if you like miraculous healing.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.900]   Now, the title allows me to do more than that but I don't think in one session that one
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.480]   can do more than that.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   Let me try and paint in the background and tell you why I'm doing this.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.720]   Everybody here, I'm quite sure, is constantly questioned on this matter, whether by a patient
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.880]   or a relative or somebody else.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   Someone's desperately ill and medical science, art or whatever you may call it, has done
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   its utmost but the patient's getting worse and somebody suggests the possibility of faith
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.320]   healing and so you're confronted by the problem.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.400]   I've been struggling with this problem for many, many years.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.000]   I suppose that of all the questions put to me from time to time, none has been put more
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.200]   frequently than this.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.920]   I was suddenly confronted by it in an acute form back in 1928.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.880]   I'd been just about 12 months in the Christian ministry, that's to say the minister of a
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.400]   church and I'd gone to preach in a place in the Vale of Glamorgan and having preached,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   I was approached at the close of the service by two local ministers who asked me if I'd
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   be prepared to go down there to chair and to conduct a conference on the question of
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   faith healing.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.680]   Well, I was rather surprised at the request coming as it did in the heart of an agricultural
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.560]   community where you don't normally get this kind of question.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.720]   So I asked them why they were interested in this subject and they said it was quite simple
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.600]   that a Pentecostal pastor had been there not long before conducting a 10 days mission and
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.240]   they decided that they'd support him and they had done so.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.520]   And they had found that there had been 66 converts as a result of the 10 day mission.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.040]   They then went on to say that they were quite clear in their minds that the converts were
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160]   not due to the preaching.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.520]   Well what were they due to I said?
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.560]   Well they said they were due to the healings.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.120]   A number of people had been healed in the meetings and so they attributed the 66 converts
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   to this.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.760]   Well, they were not believers in faith healing but they'd been impressed by this and wondered
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.900]   whether perhaps there was not something defective in their theological outlook.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.380]   So they wanted this conference and rather reluctantly I consented to do this.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.480]   For some peculiar reason, I had forgot all about this and I didn't hear from them so
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.460]   the thing went right out of my mind until about nine months later I got another request
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.180]   to preach in this place and I went.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.180]   And as I was traveling in the train, all this came back to me and I was a little bit fearful
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.420]   as to what kind of reception I'd get especially from these two men.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.780]   However, I eyed the congregation and saw my two brethren and they seemed to look quite
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.660]   normal and as usual and to my surprise they came forward to speak to me at the end.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.900]   And I said well I'm convinced of the fact that you were two good Christian men.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.660]   They said why did you say that?
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.620]   I said well you evidently have the grace of forgiveness.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.660]   They said what do you mean they said?
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.860]   And I said well you remember you asked me to come and take a conference on faith healing
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.300]   and I haven't been and they smiled.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300]   I said what's the matter?
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.020]   They said oh we are no longer interested in faith healing.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   Why not I said?
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.780]   Well they said not one of the people healed remained healed and not one of the 66 converts
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.620]   stood so they were no longer interested in faith healing.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.140]   And I must confess that I rather felt that this had settled the question, solved the
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.460]   problem.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.460]   Nothing in it.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.460]   The whole thing is spurious.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.140]   However it didn't finish it as far as I was concerned and I've been constantly face to
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.380]   face with this particular question and problem.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.700]   But I feel that recently say within the last few years the matter has become much more
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.700]   acute.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.580]   One's been struggling with it all through the years but I think there are certain new
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.500]   factors which have compelled me at Inuit to rethink this old matter and I'm putting my
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.620]   thoughts before you for what they're worth.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.520]   There is as I was saying in passing last night a new interest in phenomena.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.820]   Then there is this so-called charismatic movement and there's a good deal of talk about healing
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.900]   in connection with this apart from certain other manifestations.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.980]   There is no question at all of a great recrudescence of what one must call demon possession.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:48.020]   Now I was in a meeting of ministers last Monday and I was astonished at the number of men
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.220]   who got up to report what I would have to accept as genuine cases of this and I've met
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.800]   it in other ways also.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.060]   And it's become a very acute question for many ministers as to how you draw the line
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:11.480]   between a mental illness and a demon possession and how you handle them and so on.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.020]   Some of you may have read a book, a booklet issued by the Overseas Missionary Fellowship
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.620]   under the title of Roaring Lion which deals specifically with this question of demon possession
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.900]   which I regard as an excellent book.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.740]   And I believe it's true to say that Nevious' famous book on demon possession is about to
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.180]   be reprinted after being out of print for a number of years.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.700]   All this is indicative of this new interest in all this.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.820]   Well then some of you may have read a book by a German called Kurt Koch on the revival
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:55.140]   in Indonesia where a number of cases of healing, miraculous healing, are recorded.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:02.340]   And Kurt Koch is a man, a balanced man, a well-taught man, a good theologian, a man
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.940]   who has a good mind, a man who's very careful in his statements.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.180]   In fact, one tends to feel at times that he's almost over-cautious.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.740]   His big book Christian Counseling and the Occult, for instance, shows a great wariness
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.780]   in accepting statements of fact.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140]   He scrutinizes them and tests them and examines them.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:30.380]   But here is this man making this report of what he has seen on two visits to Indonesia
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:37.220]   where they've experienced a remarkable revival in these last five or six years.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.620]   But what really has precipitated the whole thing as far as I'm concerned personally
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.820]   was an experience I had in America two years ago.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.500]   I was there for about five months.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:57.180]   First I was asked by members of the faculty of the Westminster Theological Seminary, where
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:05.940]   they tend to be intellectual and skeptical of anything approaching enthusiasm.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:12.980]   But I was asked by these friends, "What did I think of faith healing?"
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.740]   And in particular, the activities of a lady by the name of Catherine Kuhlman.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.700]   Well as it happened, I'd read the book by Catherine Kuhlman which bears the title, I
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.020]   believe, In Miracles.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.860]   But I was interested to know why they were concerned about this.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.860]   And this was the answer I got.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:36.220]   A very well-known American preacher, Dr. Harold Ockingay, had invited Mrs. Catherine Kuhlman
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.140]   to take meetings in his church in Boston.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.860]   And as a result of the fact that it was Dr. Ockingay who had invited her, the daughter
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.260]   of one of the members of the faculty of Westminster Seminary had gone with a friend to the meeting.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:59.260]   And they'd gone in a very critical mood, but they'd come away enthusiastic, greatly impressed,
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260]   and had written home about this.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:07.220]   And so the problem had been landed on the plate of these members of the faculty at Westminster.
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.900]   And there was great discussion going on about all this.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.900]   How did we assess it?
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.180]   What did we make of it?
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.620]   Well, then going down to Cincinnati, I came up against the same problem again.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.020]   They have an annual convention in Cincinnati of evangelical people.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.820]   And amongst the speakers, a minister, a well-known minister from Pittsburgh, had been invited
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.340]   for the following October.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:35.620]   And all was well until somebody heard that this man was giving the loan of his church
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.700]   premises to Catherine Kuhlman for her meetings of healing and of biblical instruction.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:50.180]   And this raised an acute problem in the executive council of this convention.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:56.260]   And I was called in as a consultant, the only respect in which I am called in such a capacity
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.220]   these days.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:04.940]   And there was a real division amongst them as to whether this man should be allowed to
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:12.700]   speak at the convention in view of his sponsoring of these healing meetings of Catherine Kuhlman.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.580]   So I had to face it all anew and afresh.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:21.140]   And I'm going to try to give this morning the outcome of my meditations and thinking
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.060]   during that period and since.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.740]   Now I believe I'm right in saying that there are two main positions with regard to this
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.540]   whole subject amongst the Christian people.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.260]   The first is those who capitulate to phenomena.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.460]   I put it in that way quite deliberately.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.540]   Now this minister in Pittsburgh I think was an example of this.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.140]   I'm not betraying any confidence because the man does this in public and he's spoken about
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.140]   it in public.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:59.100]   He's a man of the name of Lamont, Dr. Lamont, and one of the leading preachers of the United
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.300]   Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, a man of standing and of judgment.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:12.220]   He sponsors these meetings of Catherine Kuhlman and he gives his reason for doing so.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.260]   And this is his reason.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.980]   He says we have all been doing our best for years but nothing much seems to happen.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.980]   And he says I have a great fear that we who belong to the older denominations are going
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.620]   to be bypassed.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.740]   Things are happening.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:36.260]   People are being aroused and moved and people from the world are being drawn in by people
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.580]   such as Catherine Kuhlman and others.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:47.660]   And he had become fearful lest they were in their entrenched positions missing some remarkable
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.740]   work that God is doing.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:59.140]   And the result was that he had more or less abandoned his old positions and in an entirely
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.140]   uncritical manner had said well we must go into this.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.860]   We must see what it is.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.900]   Whatever we may have believed we must be prepared to re-examine everything.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.780]   And it seemed to me that he and others with him, because there were other men representative
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.500]   of this same point of view at Cincinnati, they were virtually saying well theology doesn't
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.660]   matter as long as you see this kind of thing happening.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.940]   Now this of course is something which is manifesting itself in another way in connection with this
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.580]   charismatic movement.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.780]   Not so much over healing as over tongues and so on.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.340]   It's showing itself in this way.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:49.060]   The Roman Catholics are becoming involved in this movement and very much so in the United
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.820]   States and in Southern America, in many of the countries.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.660]   Some of you may have read a book that's come out recently called Catholic Pentecostalism.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.900]   I think this is a book that's going to make us all think and we'll have to think very
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.900]   urgently.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:10.660]   I believe it has very dangerous elements in it for this reason that the main thesis seems
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:16.080]   to be this, that theology doesn't matter.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.060]   That what really matters is that one has had this living experience of the spirit which
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.060]   manifests itself in particular gifts.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:33.880]   So you can more or less believe anything you like as long as you have these manifestations.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.100]   So I put all this under this kind of general heading of a kind of capitulation to phenomena,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:49.220]   that your theology and your views and your doctrine are more or less determined by phenomena.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.300]   Now that's one big group.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:15:00.020]   The other group of course consists of those who tend to reject the whole of this in total
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:06.340]   and feel that it really doesn't merit much discussion, that we've been hearing about
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.760]   this throughout the years and that the less we have to do with it, the better.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:19.420]   Now I want to examine these two positions and we'll start perhaps with the second.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:25.900]   Those who reject the whole thing do so, I find, on the whole for three main reasons.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.940]   Well, the first is not a reason but it's a statement of fact.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.080]   They just refuse to consider it at all.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.820]   The entire thing is dismissed.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:44.820]   It's dismissed as being psychological or something perhaps even worse, but generally psychological.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.300]   And it's done so in terms of the kind of people who practice this.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.780]   For instance, I met people who said, "Well, there you are."
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.780]   They say, "What more do you want?"
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.980]   "Here it is, Catherine Kuhlman, a woman preacher."
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:03.700]   There was no need to say any more.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.300]   And then they would recount certain aberrations amongst the Pentecostals and things of that
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   kind.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:17.380]   And then I've often had this argument, take the famous business of Lourdes amongst the
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.060]   Roman Catholics.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.980]   They won't consider any possibility of facts.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.980]   Why?
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.860]   Well, because of the very origin of Lourdes, this simple girl, slightly under normal, who
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.580]   claims to have had a vision of the Virgin Mary.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.820]   There's no need to go any further.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.060]   There's nothing in it.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.540]   The whole thing is wrong.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.300]   And though they may make claims, they can't be true.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.180]   It's impossible.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.740]   You just dismiss it on these general grounds of either the people who practice it or the
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.340]   origin of the movement or whatever it is.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:59.780]   But then there are others who reject it all on what they would call scientific grounds.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:07.220]   They say the laws of nature make this quite impossible, that nature is a closed system,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.300]   that nature is a matter of cause and effect.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.580]   And because of this, miracles are impossible.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.900]   Now, this is the old liberal attitude towards miracles, of course.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:24.940]   You remember how Matthew Arnold put it so clearly, "Miracles cannot happen, therefore
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.540]   miracles don't happen and haven't happened."
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.540]   And it's quite logical.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.740]   If they can't, well, they haven't.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.940]   And there's no more to be said.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:40.300]   But I have known, I think, many people amongst ourselves as evangelicals who have adopted
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:47.900]   that kind of scientific attitude, which rules out the possibility of the miraculous because
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:53.660]   of their view of nature and the laws of nature.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.340]   And then there is a third group which I put under the heading of biblical.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:06.500]   And they really pay very little attention to all these claims because they hold dogmatically
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:15.300]   the view that the miraculous and all such spiritual manifestations ended with the apostles,
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:22.340]   and that once we were given the scriptures, the canon of the New Testament, that all this
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.300]   came to an end.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.020]   This I think has been a very common view, and a common view amongst us.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.500]   They try to argue the case in terms of their exposition of the thirteenth chapter of the
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.780]   first epistle to the Corinthians about these things passing away when knowledge comes,
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.540]   and knowledge there means, they say, the giving of the scriptures, and so on.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:52.380]   And under this same general biblical heading, I would put the attitude which has been put
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:59.060]   forward perhaps most clearly in that book by that man called Keller, in which an attempt
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:06.580]   is made to explain what had been accepted in the past as miracles.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   Many of you may have read that book.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.940]   It came out a number of years back.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.660]   I remember one instance to give you a specimen of his kind of teaching.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:22.580]   You remember the incident of Moses striking the rock and the water gushing forth.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:29.140]   Well, now, the explanation which we are given is this, that during the last war, some British
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.260]   soldiers were having to make a new road.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.540]   And there they were with their picks and their shovels, making this new road.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.660]   And one of these soldiers, in using his pick, it happened to go back a little bit further
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.660]   than he'd intended, and it touched the rock that was behind him.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.420]   And the moment it did so, there was a little trickle of water.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.760]   So you see, it was something like this that Moses did.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.420]   This sort of thing does happen.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:06.580]   And so you were given what is purported to be an explanation of the miracle.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   In other words, it wasn't a miracle at all.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   Now, these are some of the ways in which people have rejected this whole notion of the miraculous,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.500]   the possibility of a miraculous healing at the present time.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.300]   And this is what I think needs reconsideration.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:36.340]   And I would put it to you in this form, that first of all, we must again face the question
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.500]   of facts.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.380]   It is surely unscientific to reject facts.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.700]   It is no part of our business to reject facts.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.900]   And I think we've got to face this anew and afresh.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.540]   Take the case of this Catherine Coleman.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:00.180]   She's been a minister of a Baptist church in Pittsburgh, I think now for over 20 years,
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   and is very well known, known to men like this Dr. Lamont.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:13.020]   And two medical men were elders in Dr. Lamont's church, and with whom, one of whom at one
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.620]   was able to speak.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:25.020]   These are not wild enthusiasts, but balanced, sane, well, as I've said, two Presbyterian
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   elders.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.540]   Perhaps no more needs to be said.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   Not some strange English sect, but good, solid Presbyterians.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:39.820]   And these men, I'm not talking about their views so much now as their attestation of
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:49.380]   facts, where they claim that people with organic diseases in their knowledge have been cured,
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.820]   and that it was this that has won them over to support Dr. Catherine Coleman.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:00.900]   And in her second book, which came out, I think, within the last two years, and which
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.420]   I've also read, there are cases certified by medical men.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.700]   And you have their names and degrees and hospitals to which they belong, and so on and so forth.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.260]   Indeed, one or two of the cases happen to be medical men themselves.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.420]   Well, now, I frankly am in this position.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.260]   I cannot say that these people are liars.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.960]   Neither can I say that they are deluded.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.300]   Everything that one knows about these people, or can discover about them, suggests that
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.860]   they are reliable witnesses, and that they have no reason for reporting these facts or
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:43.620]   supporting them, save that they are facts, and that they feel in honor and duty bound
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.620]   to say so.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:52.340]   And then we have the case of Harry Roberts, the spiritist in this country.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:59.400]   I don't happen to agree with Dr. Leslie Weatherhead in theology, but I'm prepared to accept certain
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:06.020]   statements of fact, and he has said quite definitely that he personally, having watched
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:14.820]   Harry Roberts for a number of days and examined cases, is quite satisfied that there again
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.420]   there were organic diseases that were healed.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.900]   But for myself, the thing that has impressed me most throughout the years was a little
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.100]   booklet I read a number of years ago by Alexis Carroll.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.900]   The older people here will remember, I'm sure, the Carroll-Dakin solution, which we used
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.540]   to have to use in the surgery immediately after the First World War, with cuts and wounds
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.140]   and things of that description.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.980]   One was familiar, therefore, with the name of Alexis Carroll.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.300]   Now, Alexis Carroll wrote a little booklet on this subject, in which he gives an account
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.060]   of something that happened in his own experience.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.420]   He's a Roman Catholic, but not a practicing one.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.900]   However, he had become interested in this whole business of Lourdes and decided to go
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.700]   and investigate it for himself.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.020]   And in this booklet, he gives an account of traveling down on the train, and there was
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.820]   a case of miliary tuberculosis.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:14.740]   It had started as a sort of intestinal tuberculosis, but it had reached this miliary stage.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.220]   He describes the distended abdomen and so on.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.260]   He examined the patient on the train and felt the patient was in extremis.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.540]   He was doubtful whether the patient would even reach Lourdes.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:34.980]   However, the next day, he saw with his own eyes the cure of this person.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.340]   He saw this distended abdomen gradually receding and going down, and he was able to examine
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:46.140]   the patient subsequently and could find no evidence of any disease whatsoever.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.300]   He then went, of course, to the medical bureau that they have at Lourdes, and which they've
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:56.220]   had for a number of years with X-rays and everything that can be desired.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:04.220]   And he, without coming to any conclusions, just stated this as a fact.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:11.020]   And I'm arguing that if we just say we don't believe in it, that we are adopting an unscientific
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.560]   attitude, we've got to face facts.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.900]   Whether they fit in with our theories or not is another matter.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.580]   It is very wrong from every reason to reject facts.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.900]   But still more interesting, it seems to me, is the extraordinary change that has been
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:32.500]   taking place in the realm of scientific thinking in these last years.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.740]   I know of nothing that's more interesting and more important than this.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.140]   I don't pretend to understand it all, but I understand enough to be able to follow the
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.860]   argument and the reasoning.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.500]   The scientific view of the 19th century has been abandoned.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.580]   It's no longer held.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:26:01.340]   Now that was a view which taught us that natural laws, or the laws of nature, governed all
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:07.140]   events, cause and effect, laws of nature.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.700]   And everything was governed by this.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.540]   They talked of every event having this kind of explanation.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:18.820]   It was deterministic, and it was mechanistic and static in its outlook.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.980]   And of course, it was the controlling scientific theory.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.660]   It had come from Descartes and from Isaac Newton.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.660]   They were the fathers of this, and it was universally adopted.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:36.460]   And I think that most of us trained in that tradition had virtually accepted this, and
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.820]   that this was the only truly scientific attitude.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:46.420]   But the fact is that as a result of the work of Einstein, his theory of relativity, and
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:51.860]   the quantum theory, and so on, there is an entirely new approach.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:56.580]   And what scientists, the best scientists, are now saying is this, that our knowledge
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   of the laws of nature, so-called, is very limited.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:09.220]   Our so-called laws of nature only describe a part of actuality and of the phenomena.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:17.340]   As far as they go, they're correct, but all they do is to describe certain common patterns.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:23.180]   It isn't that they're disputing these patterns, and that within the realm of these patterns,
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.700]   you can still talk of cause and effect.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:31.460]   But what they've discovered is that there are other factors outside these patterns,
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:39.460]   which cannot be explained in terms of our established or recognized laws of nature.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.180]   In other words, they are realizing that there are limits in the observer, and that there
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:51.340]   is so much more in the cosmos than the scientists dogmatically assumed, especially during the
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.740]   last century.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.900]   So that there is a new kind of humility, and all this business about DNA and RNA has greatly
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:06.220]   accelerated this new view of science.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.340]   In other words, the modern idea is indeterminacy.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.460]   Not determinacy, but indeterminacy.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.340]   They talk now about probability, not certainty.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.060]   There is a new kind of openness.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.460]   One of them I was reading recently, didn't hesitate to use the phrase, that the laws
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.140]   of nature, as we've called them, are actually changing.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.260]   That the rate at which light travels is changing, and the rate at which certain other phenomena
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.860]   come to pass is actually changing.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:47.620]   So that with this new view of science, you no longer teach that the laws of nature govern
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.180]   events.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.980]   This view of energy, and especially electrical energy and so on, is such that you must only
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.460]   talk about probabilities.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:05.060]   There are all sorts of possibilities, and we have no right to be dogmatic, and to lay
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.980]   it down that you always have cause and effect.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.300]   Now this can be worked out, of course, in many, many ways.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.660]   It's to me most encouraging that there is this change, because on the other view, in
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:23.580]   the end, there was no purpose in holding any view whatsoever, because even one's thinking
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.540]   was the result of some cause leading to an effect.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.700]   The whole thing was mechanistic, and what a man happened to believe was the result of
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.740]   some forces outside his own control.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.700]   There was no volition, and so on, and ultimately, of course, it did lead to an exclusion even
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.440]   of God.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.340]   If nature is this closed system, well, there's no need of God, and most of these people didn't
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.460]   believe in God at all.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.660]   However, we are concerned about it more as it affects our particular realm.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:30:01.260]   Well now then, there is this changed attitude in the realm of scientists, not Christians
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.140]   who are scientists or scientists who are Christian, but men who are primarily and essentially
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:12.020]   science, science men, and there is this remarkable change in their attitude.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:18.420]   There is this openness and the recognition of possibilities outside what we have hitherto
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.820]   regarded as being this closed system.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:31.060]   When you come to the biblical rejection or rejection of these facts and phenomena in
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:39.020]   terms of supposed biblical teaching, I personally have always found myself quite unable to accept
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:45.300]   the well-known teaching that everything belonging to the realm of the miraculous and the supernatural
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:53.060]   as manifested in New Testament times came to an end with the apostolic age.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.700]   There is no statement in the scripture which says that, none at all.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.900]   There is no specific or even indirect statement to that effect.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.740]   I believe that interpretation of 1 Corinthians 13 is quite wrong.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.060]   That refers to the future state.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.900]   To say that when the scriptures, when we have the New Testament canon established that we
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:23.460]   have all knowledge and now know even as we are known is to me quite ridiculous.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.940]   It's not an explanation.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:33.020]   The whole purpose and point of that argument is to contrast this present with our future
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.500]   state of existence.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:45.300]   And I likewise am not satisfied by Warfield's answer to those who have claimed that miracles
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.940]   did continue after the apostolic age.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:55.060]   It's well known that Tertullian and Augustine both made use of the argument of miracles
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:01.540]   happening in their time and in their age in defense and as a part of their apologetic
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.580]   for the Christian faith.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.020]   And I've never been satisfied with Warfield's answer to that.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.260]   Amongst themselves scholars are not agreed about this, that you can dismiss the whole
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.260]   thing.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:19.860]   Not only that, as one who has been very interested in the history of the Scottish Covenanters
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:26.460]   and the Scottish early reformers, I've always been deeply impressed by evidence that comes
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.460]   from those times.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.860]   There are incidents reported in the life of John Welsh, who was the son-in-law of John
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:40.500]   Knox, where it seems perfectly clear that there were miracles performed in certain strange,
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   extreme circumstances.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.460]   There's the famous Covenanter Alexander Peden.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.020]   It seems to me to be on any dispute that that man had the power of foreknowledge and did
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.900]   prophesy things that subsequently came to pass.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:02.460]   The records are quite authentic and they can be read in two great volumes that deal with
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.860]   that kind of history.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:14.540]   So that I've never been happy about this supposed biblical exclusion of the possibility of miracles.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:19.520]   The teaching has been, you see, that as all this ended with the apostles, whatever claims
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.900]   to be miraculous now must of necessity be spurious, either exaggerated or a lie and
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.100]   so on and so forth.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.340]   It can't happen.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.740]   It can't happen because all this did end with the apostles.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.580]   Now, to me, this is extremely dangerous because it means that you're forming a kind of new
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.720]   dispensationalism.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.460]   What parts of the scripture apply to us?
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.420]   Does James 5 speak to us or doesn't it?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.160]   It's clear that most of 1 Corinthians has nothing to say to us at all.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.380]   In other words, I believe we've been guilty unconsciously of introducing a new kind of
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   deism.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.460]   We've excluded God.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:00.580]   We said this can't happen because this ended at the time of the apostles.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:06.100]   Surely this is a position we're not entitled to adopt.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   We can't support it.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.060]   We're making a dogmatic statement.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.220]   It seems to solve our problems.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.700]   We can dismiss things we are told and it makes us feel happy.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.700]   But is it right?
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:21.300]   I'm suggesting that the time has come when we've got to re-examine all this lest we find
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:26.020]   ourselves advocating this kind of deism.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:33.140]   And then particularly so in the light of certain statements that are found in the scriptures.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.660]   Now I haven't all of a sudden changed my prophetic views.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:47.060]   I've been a millennialist throughout the years and I'm still extremely skeptical about these
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:52.380]   people you know who, like the young man I once met in a train, I was going to preach
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.100]   I think it was in Bath on an Easter Monday.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:03.660]   And at Reading, a young man came into my compartment with a Bible and a copy of the Times in his
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.660]   hand.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.660]   And I knew exactly what he was and what he was going to do.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.980]   He was going to a prophetic meeting and he was.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.140]   We entered into conversation.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.140]   The Times and the Bible you see.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.300]   The Bible is expounded by the Times.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.980]   It was all there.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.140]   Times and seasons could all be worked out.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:30.020]   Well now I haven't suddenly decamped and joined that company.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:37.020]   But when one sees Matthew 24, 24 for instance, where one reads, "For there shall arise false
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:43.860]   prophets, false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.740]   that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:53.980]   One's compelled to think this deals with the last times, the end of the present age.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.860]   I'm not suggesting that we are there.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.860]   We may be.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.220]   I don't know.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.340]   But all I am suggesting is this, that when that time does come, there are going to be
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:12.460]   these signs, these wonderful signs, these wonders and signs.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.460]   And they'll be so remarkable, so much as almost to deceive the very elect.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.500]   In other words, phenomena are going to take place.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.940]   There will be supernatural events.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.460]   Well if we decide beforehand that there cannot be anything of the kind, how are we going
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.140]   to find ourselves placed when this kind of thing happens, if we should still be on earth
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.040]   when it does happen?
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:41.180]   It seems to me for all these reasons that it is very wrong of us on any dogmatic grounds
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:47.300]   to dismiss the whole of what is claimed in this respect.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:53.500]   And on top of all that, I would suggest this, that in the Bible itself there is discernible
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:00.620]   surely a kind of periodicity in the appearance of these supernatural happenings.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:07.180]   For instance, there is clearly a periodicity in the Old Testament itself.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:14.380]   These things happened at special given times and for clear and obvious reasons.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:20.300]   And I think the same is seen in a measure in the New Testament.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.420]   And we are told that the Spirit is the Lord of these matters.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:30.500]   So that therefore, this is something that can happen at any time when it is the will
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   of God that it should happen.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.420]   And who are we to determine when this is to happen?
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:45.260]   Now it seems quite clear that taking the Christian era in general, that there was a profusion
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:50.180]   in the matter of such events at the very beginning which has not continued.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.420]   As I have said, I am not satisfied that it has never happened since.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.900]   But speaking generally, it has tended not to happen.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.540]   And that when you have had the great kind of revivals to which I was referring last
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:07.220]   night, the phenomena consisted not so much in the working of miracles or healings or
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:15.540]   any spiritual gifts as extraordinary power of preaching and extraordinary depth of conviction
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:21.740]   and an unusual element of joy and of exhilaration.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.060]   Well that is, it seems to me, within the lordship of the Spirit.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:32.060]   And the fact that it has generally been that in our Christian era is no proof that at any
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:39.340]   given point there may not be a reintroduction of these kind of phenomena, and especially
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.740]   as one is approaching the end of the age.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:50.980]   And in addition to this, those who have been interested in reading things like the life
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.700]   of Pastor Shi of China and so on, have come across incidents and events which I at any
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:03.780]   manner could not explain except in terms of the supernatural and the miraculous.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.100]   Very well.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:13.700]   There then is a kind of general review of this negative attitude towards the claims
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.180]   that are being made.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.860]   I am still dealing with those who reject it.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:23.420]   I am not considering at the moment the case of those who become credulous and are so impressed
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.260]   by the phenomena that they capitulate to it.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:34.220]   But now in addition to all these general remarks, I believe there are certain other facts to
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:40.500]   which we have not given the weight that should be attached to them.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:46.860]   There are certain medical facts, it seems to me, that we have tended to discount.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:55.540]   And I am referring now to the reports of spontaneous cures, and particularly in the matter of cancer.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:01.860]   I had the pleasure of meeting a man in Cincinnati who was a research man, a research medical
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.340]   man, and he had been working in Chicago with two others.
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:13.940]   And these other two had collected 244 cases in the medical literature in the United States
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.980]   of spontaneous cures of cancer.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:22.380]   And he was able to show me one of their articles in which this was reported.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.260]   And you were familiar with the kind of argument.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:32.460]   I remember when the skimp, as it is called, was looking into this matter.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:38.100]   We came across some examples there of spontaneous cures of cancer, this kind of thing.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.580]   A patient is diagnosed as having a growth, an abdominal growth.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.300]   They decide to operate.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:50.060]   But the moment they open up, they find that the thing is so extensive that there is no
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:55.060]   question of any removal of any part.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.740]   And finding that it is so widely disseminated, the surgeon decides just to sew up immediately
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.380]   and does literally nothing at all.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.260]   He's just opened the abdominal cavity and then he's immediately closed it up.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.660]   From that moment, that patient begins to recover.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.180]   And after a while, there is no trace or evidence whatsoever of the disease.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:19.620]   Now, a number of the cases in America went into that group, just a laparotomy and no
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.020]   more.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.340]   Other cases were those in which patients with this kind of growth and with secondary deposits
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:33.100]   and so on developed some intercurrent illness, a fever or something like that.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.620]   And from the moment they had this other illness, the cancerous condition began to clear up.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.140]   Well, I didn't take your time over that.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:49.140]   They had collected these 244 cases where they were quite satisfied, medical men were quite
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   satisfied that there had been this spontaneous cure in apparently hopeless cases.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.820]   I think we've got to re-examine that again and find some explanation of it.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:07.860]   It surely should open our minds somewhat from an over-dogmatic position.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:17.460]   Then I think it's interesting that there is a new view of disease coming in, a new theory
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:23.060]   has to disease the whole process of health and disease.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.060]   We shouldn't be surprised at this.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:30.820]   You remember the statement in 1 Corinthians 11 with regard to the communion service where
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:36.300]   the apostle says that because some people haven't examined themselves and so on, for
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.980]   this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:48.900]   The apostle there teaches quite clearly that illness sometimes, not always, but sometimes
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.780]   has a spiritual cause.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:56.980]   It's for this cause many are weak and sickly among you.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:04.820]   In other words, spiritual conditions can lead to physical diseases and conditions.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.940]   Well, we always ought to have known that and we should have given due weight to that.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.860]   But now, of course, that doesn't present the difficulty it once did, the whole notion
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:23.660]   of stress and of psychosomatic medicine tallies with this and shows us how observers, quite
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:31.300]   apart from Christianity, have come to see that we have been sadly neglecting this kind
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:37.340]   of psychic aspect in the whole notion of disease.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:43.260]   We've been too materialistic and mechanistic in our outlook.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:49.700]   The change that any man of my age has observed in medicine in this respect is really quite
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.700]   astounding.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:44:00.260]   I can still remember the early days of Freudianism and psychoanalysis, and it was, of course,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:05.020]   one joke that one could always fall back on when everything else had gone.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:12.060]   It was so funny and the kind of men who, when asked the causes of gastric ulcer, started
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:18.220]   by saying "warrior anxiety" and the way he was ridiculed by the chief and by everybody
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.220]   else.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.220]   It was all so funny.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:26.380]   It was purely a matter of the amount of acid in the stomach and so on, and had there been
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.380]   an injury.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.820]   You're familiar with all this.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.500]   Well, now, here is a new view which brings in another aspect.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:40.220]   Not only that, we've read from time to time of cases where a patient has suddenly developed,
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.780]   say, diabetes as the result of a shock.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:52.620]   I'm familiar with one example of this in my own family, where an aunt of mine, who'd been
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:59.220]   perfectly well, her eldest son was killed in a very tragic manner, and she promptly
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.940]   developed the symptoms of diabetes and was treated with insulin as long as she lived.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:11.060]   Other cases have been reported, and one is hearing about this kind of thing.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.900]   I think that there have been cases, and indeed others have expressed this, of course, where
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:25.180]   a cancerous growth seems to have been started by some kind of shock or a disappointment
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.980]   or something like that.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:33.340]   Furthermore, there is a tendency today to regard all these diseases not so much in the
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:39.740]   old local way as in a more systemic or constitutional manner.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:46.980]   Is cancer only a local disease, or is it a general condition with local manifestations?
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:52.540]   Surely the view increasingly is that it's general with local manifestations and not
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.660]   merely a local condition.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.460]   And there's all this speculation about the role of immunogens and so on.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.300]   You've been reading some of these learned addresses that have been delivered on this
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:09.940]   subject, and to me it's all very, very fascinating, because it's all indicative of the fact that
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:17.140]   people are now realizing that the whole man is involved and that we mustn't consider only
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.220]   local manifestations, that there are all these other factors.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:28.220]   We were familiar in a measure with this years ago.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:33.220]   I remember the introduction of the protein shock treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:39.660]   Well, there in a sense was the application of a similar theory.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:44.660]   You were deliberately giving a shock to this patient in order to stimulate a kind of general
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:50.480]   resistance which then would look after this particular local condition.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:57.420]   You deliberately gave this person this tremendous reaction in order that it might deal with
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   that.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:05.220]   I've often told a story which has its amusing element to illustrate this thing.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.180]   I remember at the close of a service once when I was preaching in a certain place, I
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.020]   happened to notice during the singing of a hymn that a minister in that town whom I'd
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:19.020]   known for years was more or less being carried in by two people and put to sit in a seat,
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.500]   obviously crippled with rheumatoid arthritis.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.900]   They brought him on to me at the end and he said he wanted to ask me a question.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.620]   His question was this.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:33.940]   He had been fortunate at last in getting a bed in the Royal Mineral Hospital at Bath.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:42.580]   He wanted to go there, but to his utter discomfiture he'd received an intimation the day before
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:47.260]   that he wouldn't be admitted to that bed unless he was vaccinated.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.740]   He was in trouble about being vaccinated.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.860]   He was afraid that in his frail condition that this might kill him and so on.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.860]   What was my advice?
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.620]   Should he be vaccinated or not?
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.260]   The answer I gave him was this, that as he was so fortunate in getting a bed in that
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.100]   famous hospital, he should go there at all costs.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.540]   Then I added as a kind of footnote, I said, "Yes, and in any case," I said, "you know,
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.340]   you never know what good this vaccination may do you.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.860]   It may very well clear up your whole condition."
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   We left it at that.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.700]   I didn't see this man for six months.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.340]   Next time I saw him, he came walking to me perfectly well.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.940]   I said, "Well, they obviously have very good treatment in the Royal Mineral Hospital at
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.940]   Bath."
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   He said, "I never went there."
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:30.620]   Well, I said to him, "What happened to you?"
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.980]   He said, "Well, as you said," he said, "I had such a violent reaction with the vaccination,
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.340]   it seemed to cure me."
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.340]   It had cured him.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:45.180]   Well, now, here is something, surely, that should have made us think and think seriously
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.620]   as to the whole process of health and of disease.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.900]   Isn't it clear that this is a very delicate and a very sensitive mechanism?
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   There is a balance.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:03.740]   There is something in the human body that preserves this extraordinary balance between
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.140]   health and disease.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:12.100]   I remember 50 years ago reading a great book bearing the title of Infection and Resistance,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.140]   and it left a deep impress on my mind.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.940]   This balance.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:22.100]   Now it seems to me that not in the realm of infection only, but speaking much more generally
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:28.740]   in diseases like those to which I have referred, there is this extraordinary balance.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.500]   There are forces that are disease-producing.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.900]   They are held in check.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.180]   And it is obvious that all this is controlled by the nervous system.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.180]   This must be the controlling element.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:52.340]   So that I would come to this conclusion, that disease may be caused by many factors.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:59.020]   One of a large number of factors may hit this controlling mechanism and knock out of action
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.480]   temporarily, if you like, the mechanism that preserves health.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   It may be a shock.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.380]   It may be an accident.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.700]   Or it may be an infection.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.820]   It may be one of many, many factors.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.540]   Surely we must look at it like that.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:20.420]   Well then, are we not entitled to look at the other side and to say this, that cures
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:27.740]   likewise may be the result of many, many factors?
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.260]   You have the ordinary means which we use.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.460]   Penicillin, etc.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:38.240]   A direct attack on the germs.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.940]   We still haven't altogether abandoned, have we, the building up of resistance.
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.220]   There was always that element.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:48.420]   We used to send TB people to Switzerland and so on.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   What for?
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.380]   Well, to build up the resistance.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.240]   We had nothing whereby we could attack the germs directly.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:00.620]   So what we did then was to build up the resistance, infection and resistance, this balance.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.780]   And if you could push up the resistance, down went the infection, and so on.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.580]   Well now, that is still there.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:15.540]   But not only do we think in terms of the ordinary or the well-recognized and the usual means,
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.860]   I think we've now got to go further.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:26.100]   If shock can cause a disease, why can't a corresponding shock on the other side restore
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:32.140]   the patient to health, stimulate the mechanism on that side and put an end to the diseased
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.180]   condition?
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:40.020]   And as I say, there are examples and illustrations being accumulated in the literature, medical
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:44.740]   literature, which are pointing very strongly in this direction.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:50.700]   And what about this whole question of the will to live?
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.860]   I'm suggesting, you see, that we've tended to be too mechanistic in our outlook upon
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.860]   disease.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.180]   We've tended to forget the patient.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.860]   We've tended to forget this delicate mechanism.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:07.300]   Now I'm very fond, I'm becoming aged, you see, and so you indulge in reminiscences and
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.820]   you'll have to bear with me.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.980]   But there are certain things which get impressed on one's mind that one never forgets.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:23.460]   I often told the story of doing a round one day in Baths with our Chief Lord Horder, and
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.260]   we came to the bed of a man, a blacksmith.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:34.780]   There he was in the corner propped up, panting for breath, legs swollen, ascites and all
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.460]   the rest of it.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.780]   And he had become rambling and delirious.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:45.740]   And the two house physicians and myself had come to the conclusion that the man was obviously
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.300]   dying and we wondered whether he'd last out through the day.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.940]   However, we came to this man's bed and we were beginning to talk and the poor old patient
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.700]   was rambling and kept on muttering something and he was making the proceedings impossible.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.140]   So Horder turned to him and said, "Now," he said, "what are you saying?
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.820]   What are you saying, my good men?"
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.940]   And the man said, "Can I get up tonight, sir?"
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.980]   And Horder, to our utter astonishment, said, "Yes, certainly."
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.180]   Well I must have registered something on my face and so did the house physicians.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.260]   So Horder drew us all aside and took us to stand before the fire.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:29.420]   And he said, "I can see that you all think I've suddenly taken leave of my senses."
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.460]   And we didn't actually say it but we looked.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:40.620]   Well now, he said, "Let me tell you exactly why I told that man that he could get up."
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.420]   He said, "You are all agreed, aren't you, that this man is going to die?"
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.420]   "Yes, sir."
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.420]   He said, "I agree with you."
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.140]   "Therefore, let him get up.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.140]   Why?"
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.300]   "Well, don't refuse a request from a dying man.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.220]   If you are sure he's going to die, his getting up can't make any difference.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.820]   He's going to die in any case.
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.820]   You're sure of it."
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.940]   "Well, don't refuse the request of a dying man."
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.500]   So that's my main reason for saying that he can get up.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.660]   But he said, "You know, I have got a second reason."
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.300]   He said, "The heart is an extraordinary organ.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:22.060]   And when it is sometimes very badly diseased, it can be lazy on top of that.
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:26.820]   And sometimes you'll find," he said, "that a diseased heart can benefit from a little
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.820]   activity.
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:32.340]   So, as in any case he's going to die and you can't do any harm, let him get up.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.220]   Let's wait and see what happens."
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.940]   So we got the man up for about ten minutes.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.300]   And he got back and he slept better that night than he'd done for many nights.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:47.900]   Well, to cut a long story short, that man so improved that we discharged him.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.420]   And he'd come up and report every so on.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:56.060]   And when I left at the end of 1926, he was still just reporting once every six months
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.660]   for us to keep an eye on him.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.300]   Well, now, what was this factor?
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.380]   What did this?
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:07.900]   This wasn't a question of the change in the amount of digitales or anything else.
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.300]   There was this other factor that came in.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:17.260]   And I feel that we've not been giving sufficient attention to this.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.340]   Will you take one other story?
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.820]   This has also impressed me.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:27.780]   I used to go and preach in a place every year in the Vale of Glamorgan.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.180]   I made one of the greatest blunders of my life in a medical sense.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:37.740]   I was preaching at this little place, I remember, for the first time in 1928 on a Tuesday night
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.300]   and Wednesday afternoon and evening.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:46.580]   And having supper with the old lady with whom I'd put to stay, and she was a real old lady
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.340]   worthy of the name, quite a tyrant in her local community.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.500]   And she and I were having a little supper before I went home.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:58.100]   And she leaned across the table halfway through and said, "Will you do an old woman a favor?"
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.100]   I said, "Well, if I can, I will.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.100]   I'd be glad to do so."
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.100]   Well, she said, "Will you come and preach next year at these meetings?"
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.260]   "All right," I said, "I will."
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.740]   We went on eating.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.060]   After a while, she leaned forward again.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.660]   She said, "Look here, will you do an old woman another favor?"
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.500]   I said, "Well, it depends what it is."
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.020]   "Oh, it's all right," she said, "you can do it."
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.020]   Well, I said, "What is it?"
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.700]   "Will you promise to come and preach at these meetings as long as we both live?"
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.060]   "Well," she'd already told me she was aged 79.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.820]   Her skin was more like parchment than skin.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:30.300]   And I, in my cleverness, came to the conclusion that there was no risk at all involved in
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.300]   it.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.780]   So I entered into the contract.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.100]   This was 1928.
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:42.380]   Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter, but I solemnly had to go and preach in that
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.380]   place.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:50.260]   It was Lantwick Major until 1939, every year.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.020]   But for the war and her evacuation to mid-Wales because of the aerodrome, I'd have had to
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.060]   go on until 1942 when she died.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.100]   But this is the point of this story.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.420]   I think it was somewhere about 1936.
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.180]   This poor old lady got a terrible attack of bronchitis and bronchopneumonia.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.660]   There was no penicillin then, you know.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.260]   The M&B drugs were just coming in.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.860]   I don't know whether they'd even come in.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.380]   I can't quite remember the year.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.380]   She was desperate.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:23.020]   A wealthy old lady, day nurses, night nurses, all the relatives, and they were quite convinced,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:28.340]   all of them, and the medical men as well, that she was finished, she was dying.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:34.580]   One morning, about three o'clock in the morning, she suddenly sat up in bed and said, "Give
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.580]   me that calendar, Armandek, on the wall."
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.660]   Of course, they thought this was a part of the delirium.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:44.420]   However, she insisted upon having it, and they gave it to her.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.900]   And she looked at it and turned over a page and looked and turned back and on and on.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.900]   Well, typical delirium, of course.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   However, it's all right.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.900]   As long as it amused her, everything was all right.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:58:00.180]   Suddenly she said to them, "He'll be here in six weeks."
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.700]   She'd worked out, you see, the date of my annual visit.
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:13.260]   And from that moment, she began to get well.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:20.180]   How do you explain that?
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:27.620]   It wasn't the case of another example of the thing I remember well, and I'm only reminded
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:34.620]   of this now, of a very literary-minded student reading out a note to Horder one day, and
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:37.940]   having, with great flourish given the history and the family history and all the rest of
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.420]   it, came to his findings.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.940]   And his first remark was this.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:47.380]   He said, "I noticed that as I approached the bed, the patient looked somewhat apprehensive."
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:52.740]   "Wait a minute," said Horder, "the fact that a patient looks apprehensive when you approach
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.100]   the bed is not of necessity a sign of disease."
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:00.860]   Well, I don't think that came in in the case of this old lady in Lantwick Major.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:06.460]   Well, in other words, do you see, I'm trying to show that there are so many factors that
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:12.340]   we tend to exclude, which can play upon this delicate mechanism of health and disease.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.300]   And into this category, I would put faith.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:22.780]   Now faith of any kind, I don't care what kind, if this view is correct, any kind of faith
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.340]   can do it.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:28.880]   The spiritist can do it.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.580]   We mustn't limit these factors.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:36.060]   All this has been a great help to me in my own understanding.
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.940]   I haven't mentioned the people who seem to have a natural gift of healing.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.180]   I don't understand that.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:47.620]   But it's clear to me that as many factors can cause disease, many factors can produce
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.800]   cures.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:55.740]   Not only Christian faith, but any kind of faith, shock, any one of these factors can
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.740]   do it.
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:57.740]   Very well.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:04.100]   So I come to my final conclusions and ask your forgiveness for these rambling remarks.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:10.380]   We as Christians must believe in miracles, not because of all I've been saying, but because
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.020]   we believe the Bible.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:19.740]   Our belief in God should put us into a position where we have no difficulty at all in accepting
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:25.220]   the miraculous, and that it can happen at any moment in the will and the volition of
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.760]   God.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.420]   What I've been trying to say this morning is of apologetic value, but it should never
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.600]   be the basis of our faith.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.340]   For us to say, "Oh yes, I can believe in miracles now because of the new scientific
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.940]   outlook and because of a new way of looking at health and disease," is to me almost a
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.720]   contradiction of the Christian faith.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.380]   We believe because we believe the record.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:57.860]   But this I've been putting before you should be of some apologetic help and value to us,
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:02.620]   and especially in the ways that I'm going to indicate.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:09.140]   I feel that we must be very careful lest we fall into the same error as the Roman Catholic
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:14.620]   Church fell into over the case of Copernicus and Galileo.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:20.680]   They rejected his facts, you remember, because they didn't fit into their theory.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.060]   We must be very careful that we are not caught at the same point, that we will not recognize
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.100]   facts because our theory makes it impossible.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.640]   Indeed, I've sometimes had a fear that our dogmatism is far too similar to that of the
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.700]   Communists with regard to Lysenko.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.500]   We mustn't theoretically ban certain findings.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:49.120]   We must have an open mind and be ready to receive them and to examine them.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.940]   So I would go on to say that we must still continue to maintain our healthy, skeptical,
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:02:00.060]   and critical attitude to everything that is reported to us.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:05.200]   But I think we must be critical on all sides, not simply on one.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.800]   We must criticize the dogmatisms of science.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.940]   The scientists themselves are doing it, so we mustn't lag behind too much.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.500]   We must be aware of all these immense possibilities that are opening out.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.740]   So many of the old established dogmatic positions of the scientists are being queried at the
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:26.360]   present time, partly as the result of these trips to the moon and so on.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.340]   Everything is so much bigger, the possibilities.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.220]   Man really knows so little.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:35.300]   Because we have knowledge in a certain segment, we've tended to assume we know it all, but
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   we don't.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.780]   Probability, remember now, not determinism.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:47.220]   But – and to me this is the most important finding of all from the theological standpoint
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:56.980]   – we must not allow our doctrine to be determined by phenomena.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.660]   Now this, it seems to me, is the danger.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:07.260]   As I told you, there are good men at Pittsburgh and others, and there are many today, who
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:15.380]   seem to be so fascinated by results that they prepare to abandon what they've always believed.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.940]   Now here, to me, is the real danger.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.660]   And I hope I've been able to show that there's no need to do that.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.100]   You see, their argument, more or less, was this kind of argument.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.540]   Well now, here are these things that Katherine Goldman, for instance, is doing.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.100]   Here are concrete results.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.140]   Who am I to stand up against this?
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.980]   Who am I to trust to my thinking?
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.260]   Now there is the fallacy.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:42.020]   They're prepared, as it were, to ordain Katherine Goldman, and so on.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.980]   Now let me put the argument like this.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:49.420]   You do not decide whether it is right for a woman to preach and to be a pastor of a
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.900]   church by phenomena that she can produce.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.660]   It's the Bible that still determines that.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:04.580]   You are doctrine in every respect, still is determined by the Bible.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.420]   What about these other things, then, you say?
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.340]   Well I reply, I mean no difficulty about them.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:14.340]   I don't deny what she reports as facts and others substantiate as facts.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:19.500]   I recognize that there are a number of factors that can produce healings.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:26.460]   Therefore, that she produces healings doesn't substantiate her claim to be a minister, as
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:31.820]   well as a man, or that I've got to accept all that she teaches about everything.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.740]   Now this is what has been happening.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.500]   Throughout the years, I've known very good people who, because of something they've seen
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:42.420]   in a Pentecostal meeting, have joined a Pentecostal church.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.500]   You see why they've done it.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.540]   Because of this which has happened, they submit to the entire teaching.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.700]   And there are those who go to Catholicism, Roman Catholicism, for the same reason.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:59.100]   My hope is that in what I've put before you, we can be delivered completely from that by
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:06.780]   seeing that these phenomena can be explained quite simply and adequately in the terms I've
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.220]   suggested to you.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.220]   And I can accept them.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:16.740]   And my position, dogmatically and doctrinally and theologically, is quite undisturbed.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.700]   I still go to the Bible for my views on all these matters.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.340]   Now the Bible itself teaches us to do this.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:28.780]   Jambres and Jambres, you remember, could reproduce a great deal of what Moses and Aaron did.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:34.980]   Our Lord says in Matthew 7 that there would be people who would come to him and say, "Lord,
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.980]   Lord."
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:40.700]   They'd not only believed in him, but they'd done many mighty works and cast out devils
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.700]   in his name.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.700]   He doesn't dispute the claim nor the facts.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.580]   But still he says, "I never knew you.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.420]   Depart from me."
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:55.860]   All along the Bible tells us to prove and to test and to examine the spirits.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:01.460]   The Bible itself teaches us that there are many forces and factors that can produce phenomena
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.540]   and results.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.420]   Some of them are evil spirits.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   Well how do you decide?
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.700]   Well now then, all I'm saying is the phenomenon doesn't decide.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.640]   You don't capitulate to the phenomenon.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:19.280]   You arrive at your conclusions on other and on biblical grounds.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:27.480]   So that miraculous or at any rate supernatural happenings and events do not validate a ministry
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:33.760]   of necessity and certainly must never be allowed to determine our point of view.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.600]   So you may ask me at this point, "Well how do you decide in any particular case?"
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.000]   And it's extremely difficult.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.160]   Miss Catherine Kuhlman is to me one of the most difficult cases of all because she preaches
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:53.600]   the Lord Jesus Christ as you and I would do, and she seems to be correct in her doctrine.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   That's what makes it difficult.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.160]   There are other elements in her ministry, and I heard her several days on the radio.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.400]   There are many elements about her ministry about which I would be extremely unhappy.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:10.780]   To me an obvious psychological element, even an assumed vice, and a very artificial one
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:17.900]   at that, and a great deal of laughter and of joking and of things of that description.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.920]   And still more basic, this whole question of the teaching of the Bible with regard to
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   the ministry of women.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:32.040]   Well now, however, the comfort I seem to have arrived at in myself is this, that I'm no
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:40.040]   longer troubled about this, that my decision is still a biblical one and a doctrinal one,
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:45.560]   and I am not overawed or upset or frightened by the phenomena, and allow the phenomena
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.880]   to shake my whole position.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.200]   So you have to come back to certain general principles.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:59.620]   In the New Testament, and indeed in the Old, you never find miracles announced beforehand.
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:04.880]   It seems quite clear to me that in all these cases reported in the Scriptures, what happened
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:12.400]   was that an immediate commission was given to the men or to the men who worked the miracle.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.720]   Peter and John were the men at the beautiful gate of the temple, Paul were the men at Lystra,
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.720]   and so on.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.680]   They didn't know they were going to do this.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.360]   I believe they were given an immediate commission.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.960]   So they didn't experiment, and we're not given any reports of failures in the book
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   of Acts.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.320]   But there's a kind of certainty and assurance and a confidence, and I believe this was the
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.160]   result of the commission that was given to the men concerned, and he knew that it was
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.940]   going to happen.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:49.140]   One notices also that the effect of the working of miracles upon the people was to fill them
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:53.860]   with a sense of awe and of fear at times.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:09:02.720]   They would say, "We have seen wonderful things today," or ascribe power to God.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.360]   Whereas in these other popular healing meetings and so on, there's laughter and jocularity,
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.200]   and they even boast of this.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:19.280]   I would say that the Bible teaches that any manifestation of the power of God is awe-inspiring
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:25.000]   and excludes any spirit of levity, any kind of lightness in the attitude.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.720]   So you are left with these general considerations.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.920]   I must say just one other word, as I'm sure I shall be questioned about it.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:41.240]   On this meaning of faith, you remember in James 5 and in Mark 11, 22 and 24, "The
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.560]   prayer of faith shall heal the sick."
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.820]   You remember that.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:50.020]   And then there's this other one that people are so troubled by, and I've been questioned
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.840]   about it so constantly.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.600]   Let me read these words from Mark 11, 22 to 24.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.320]   And Jesus answering saith unto them, "Have faith in God.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:04.360]   For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.900]   and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.940]   those things which he saith shall come to pass.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.100]   He shall have whatsoever he saith.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:20.200]   For I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.640]   them, and ye shall have them."
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.840]   Now we've all known people who've been trying to work themselves up into this faith.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.960]   That I believe is the fallacy.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.520]   I believe that faith referred to there as the prayer of faith in James 5 is again a
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.120]   given faith.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.280]   I put it into the same category as the commission that was given to the apostles and others
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.160]   who in my opinion have worked miracles since the day of the apostles.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.800]   Not experimentation, not announcement on Sunday there's going to be a healing meeting on
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.800]   Thursday.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.340]   You can't do that because you don't know.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.200]   This is given, and the prayer of faith is given.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.720]   You can't work it up.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.800]   You either have it or you haven't got it.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:11.360]   And so it depends upon your general spirituality and your general belief and faith in God.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.640]   My final word is one of warming.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:24.400]   We all must have had people coming to us who have been healed as they claim in a spiritist
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:32.560]   meeting or as the result of the activity of a spiritist spiritual healing.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.840]   Now here I suggest that it is very wrong or foolish more or less to tell the person in
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.040]   front of you that he hasn't been healed.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.800]   I think we've had a tendency to do that at times.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.380]   I trust it's clear that they can do this.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.920]   But I believe at this point we've got to warn these people.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.860]   We mustn't try to make them ill again in order to keep our doctrine correct.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:00.960]   But what we must do is to tell them that having thus submitted to a power that we believe
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.680]   originates in evil spirits, they have to be very careful that the evil spirits do not
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.840]   take advantage of this.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.440]   Now Kurt Koch in his big book Christian Counseling and the Occult constantly makes this point
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.240]   and it's an obvious one.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:26.120]   If at any time you uncritically yield yourself to an unseen power, you're asking for trouble.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.480]   You see the Bible tells us to prove them and to test them.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.360]   It recognizes their reality and their influence and their power.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:41.040]   We have underestimated, it seems to me, tragically as evangelicals, the power of evil spirits.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.200]   We have wrestled not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers, against
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:51.920]   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.960]   We've got to realize this and we've got to warn these people therefore that having once
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:04.320]   yielded themselves for the purposes of health, they may be more liable to subsequent onslaughts
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.400]   on the part of such influences and powers.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.880]   So I would conclude by saying this.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.320]   We must continue to use the means as usual.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.920]   God's customary way of dealing with disease is through these means and methods, abilities
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.600]   he's given to men, drugs that he's put in such profusion in nature and so on.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:37.200]   But in addition, we must remember this other factor and not be surprised at it, indeed
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:44.600]   to be expectant, not to be disturbed in our theology, not to abandon our biblical positions
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.960]   because of phenomena, but to try and to test them all.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.640]   Explain them in these ways, as we are enabled now to do, more easily perhaps than before,
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:04.280]   but still to believe that with God all things are possible, that God can work miracles today
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.640]   as he has done in past ages.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:17.080]   And especially as the days of darkness and the forces of evil seem to be coming out in
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:24.800]   an unusually aggressive and potent manner, we must not exclude dogmatically, in the way
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:33.760]   we've often tended to do, the equally positive manifestation and demonstration of the power
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:41.400]   of God to heal diseases or to do anything that he wills and chooses to do.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.120]   Well, sir, there are some of these thoughts that have resulted from being confronted by
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.200]   this problem anew and afresh from two years ago.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
