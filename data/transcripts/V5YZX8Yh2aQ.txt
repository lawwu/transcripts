[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   Why do you think that so many of the people who have led emergent ventures, as you said,
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.340]   are interested in effective altruism?
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.060]   There is like a moment right now for effective altruism where it is the thing.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.440]   Some of it is political polarization, like the main parties are so stupid and offensive.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.460]   Those energies will go somewhere.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.900]   Some of that in the 1970s, say, maybe went to libertarianism.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.980]   Libertarianism has been out there for too long.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.860]   It doesn't seem to address a lot of current problems like climate change or pandemics
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.460]   very well.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.140]   So where should it go?
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.180]   Rationality community gets some of it.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.140]   That's related to EA, as I'm sure you know.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.740]   Just like the tech startup community gets some of it.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.780]   That's great.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.660]   It seems to be working pretty well to me.
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.660]   Like, I'm not an EA person, but maybe they deserve a lot of it.
