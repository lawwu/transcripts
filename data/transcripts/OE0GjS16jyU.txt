[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   - Some of the fascinating work you've done
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.080]   is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.400]   Can you describe first of all what is supersymmetry?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.560]   - Ah yes, so you remember the two buckets I told you about,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.240]   perhaps earlier, so there are two buckets in our universe.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240]   So now I want you to think about drawing a pie
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.880]   that has four quadrants, so I want you to cut
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.320]   the piece of pie in fourths.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.400]   So in one quadrant I'm gonna put all the buckets
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.640]   that we talked about that are like the electron
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.080]   and the quarks, in a different quadrant I am going
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.660]   to put all the force carriers.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.740]   The other two quadrants are empty.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.680]   Now if you, I showed you a picture of that,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.400]   you'd see a circle, there would be a bunch of stuff
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.040]   in one upper quadrant and stuff in others,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.080]   and then I would ask you a question.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.780]   Does that look symmetrical to you?
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.040]   - No.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000]   - No, and that's exactly right because we humans
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   actually have a very deeply programmed sense of symmetry.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.080]   It's something that is part of that mystery of the universe.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600]   So how would you make it symmetrical?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.140]   One way you could is by saying those two empty quadrants
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.100]   had things in them also, and if you do that,
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.680]   that's supersymmetry.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.220]   So that's what I understood when I was a graduate student
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.160]   here at MIT in 1975, when the mathematics of this
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.420]   was first being born.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.240]   Supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.120]   in the late '60s, but we had this thing called
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.720]   the Iron Curtain, so we Westerners didn't know about it.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080]   But by the early '70s, independently,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.560]   there were scientists in the West who had rediscovered
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.160]   supersymmetry, Bruno Zemino and Julius Vest
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.620]   were their names.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.360]   So this was around '71 or '72 when this happened.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.640]   I started graduate school in '73, so around '74, '75,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.320]   I was trying to figure out how to write a thesis
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.800]   so that I could become a physicist the rest of my life.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   I had a great advisor, Professor James Young,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.320]   who had taught me a number of things about electrons
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   and weak forces and those sorts of things.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   But I decided that if I was going to have a really,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.680]   an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   I should strike it out in a direction that other people
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.960]   were not studying.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.440]   And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.560]   that were being developed, and I came across the idea
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   of supersymmetry.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.880]   And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   that I just, it bowled me over.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640]   I actually have two undergraduate degrees.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.740]   My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics,
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.040]   and my second is physics, even though I always wanted
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.220]   to be a physicist.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.720]   Plan A, which involved getting good grades, was mathematics.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.200]   but my heart was in physics.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   - If we could take a small digression,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.280]   what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.760]   that you've encountered in this interplay
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.600]   between math and physics?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.680]   - It's the idea of symmetry.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   The fact that our innate sense of symmetry winds up
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.720]   aligning with just incredible mathematics,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.640]   to me, is the most beautiful thing.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   It's very strange but true that if symmetries were perfect,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360]   we would not exist.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.480]   And so even though we have these very powerful ideas
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.920]   about balance in the universe in some sense,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   it's only when you break those balances
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.200]   that you get creatures like humans
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.800]   and objects like planets and stars.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.280]   So although they are a scaffold for reality,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.720]   they cannot be the entirety of reality.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   So I'm kind of naturally attracted to parts of physics
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.160]   and attracted to parts of science and technology
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.640]   where symmetry plays a dominant role.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.720]   - And not just, I guess, symmetry as you said,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.040]   but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.800]   - The magic happens when you break the symmetry.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.480]   - Okay, so diving right back in,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.320]   you mentioned four quadrants.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.280]   - Yes.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.360]   - Two are filled with stuff, two buckets.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.680]   And then there's crazy mathematical thing,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   ideas for filling the other two.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.560]   What are those things?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.440]   - So earlier, the way I described these two buckets
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.160]   is I gave you a story that started out
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.920]   by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.480]   And I said, "Turn on your flashlight, I'll turn on mine.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.120]   "The beams will go through each other."
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.480]   They carry the electromagnetic force.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.600]   And they pass right through each other.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.840]   So imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.640]   which you don't have to imagine people like me do that.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.000]   So you take that mathematics,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.400]   and then you ask yourself a question.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.880]   You see, mathematics is a palette.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   It's just like a musical composer
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.640]   is able to construct variations on a theme.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   is something that we can construct variations on.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.480]   So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   about light, we know how to construct variations on that.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.480]   And one of the variations you can construct
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.800]   is to say, suppose you have a force carrier
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.400]   for electromagnetism that behaves like an electron
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.480]   in that it would bounce off of another one.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.400]   That's changing a mathematical term in an equation.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.840]   So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.080]   So you would say, first,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.840]   it belongs in this force-carrying bucket.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.920]   But it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520]   So you say, well, gee, wait, no,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.720]   that's not the right bucket.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.880]   So you're forced to actually put it
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.920]   in one of these empty quadrants.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.200]   So those sorts of things, basically, we give them,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.040]   so the photon mathematically can be accompanied by a photino.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.320]   It's the thing that carries a force
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.960]   but has the rule of bouncing off.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.360]   In a similar manner, you could start with an electron.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.840]   And you say, okay, so write down
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.120]   the mathematics of an electron.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.320]   I know how to do that.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   A physicist named Dirac first told us how to do that
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.600]   back in the late '20s, early '30s.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.400]   So take that mathematics, and then you say,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.800]   let me look at that mathematics
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.720]   and find out what in the mathematics
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.360]   causes two electrons to bounce off of each other,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.640]   even if I turn off the electrical charge.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.720]   So I could do that.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.320]   And now let me change that mathematical term.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.800]   So now I have something that carries electrical charge,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.440]   but if you take two of them,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.800]   I'm sorry, if you turn their charges off,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.480]   they'll pass through each other.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.760]   So that puts things in the other quadrant.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.800]   And those things we tend to call,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.680]   we put the S in front of their name.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.960]   So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.320]   In this now newly filled quadrant, we have electrons.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.440]   In the quadrant over here, we had quarks.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.880]   Over here, we have squarks.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.720]   So now we've got this balanced pi,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   and that's basically what I understood
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.640]   as a graduate student in 1975
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.560]   about this idea of supersymmetry,
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.520]   that it was going to fill up these two quadrants
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.040]   of the pi in a way that no one
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.920]   had ever thought about before.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.360]   So I was amazed that no one else at MIT
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.520]   found this an interesting idea.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.960]   So it led to my becoming the first person
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.680]   in MIT to really study supersymmetry.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.800]   This is 1975, '76, '77.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.040]   And in '77, I wrote the first PhD thesis
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.280]   in the physics department on this idea
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.800]   because I was drawn to the balance.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720]   - Drawn to the symmetry.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   So what does that, first of all,
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.440]   is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.720]   So how much experimental,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.560]   and we'll have this theme,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   it's a really interesting one.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.400]   When you explore the world of the small,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.440]   and in your new book talking about
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.320]   Approving Einstein, right, that we'll also talk about,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.880]   there's this theme of kind of starting it,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.760]   exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.280]   and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.840]   Where do you put supersymmetry in that?
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.520]   - It's closer than string theory.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.980]   It has not yet been validated.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.480]   In some sense, you mentioned Einstein,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.720]   so let's go there for a moment.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.340]   In our book, Proving Einstein Right,
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.120]   we actually do talk about the fact
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.440]   which were very different from Newton's equations
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   in describing gravity.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.240]   These equations made some predictions
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.560]   that were different from Newton's predictions.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.400]   It actually made three different predictions.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   One of them was not actually a prediction,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.360]   but a postdiction because it was known
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   that Mercury was not orbiting the sun
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.900]   in the way that Newton would have told you.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.140]   And so Einstein's theory actually describes Mercury orbiting
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.500]   in the way that it was observed
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.100]   as opposed to what Newton would have told you.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.900]   So that was one prediction.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.560]   The second prediction that came out
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.960]   of the theory of general relativity,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.680]   which Einstein wrote in 1915,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.640]   was that if you,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.860]   so let me describe an experiment and come back to it.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.940]   Suppose I had a glass of water,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.380]   and I filled the glass up,
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.480]   and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.260]   between our two faces.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.000]   It would appear to me like your face was moving,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.240]   even though you weren't moving.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.440]   I mean, it's actually, and what's causing it
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.780]   is because the light gets bent through the glass
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.540]   as it passes from your face to my eye.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.540]   So Einstein, in his 1915 theory of general relativity,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.620]   found out that gravity has the same effect on light
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.660]   as that glass of water.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.420]   It would cause beams of light to bend.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.180]   Now, Newton also knew this,
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.900]   but Einstein's prediction was that light
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.940]   would bend twice as much.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.460]   And so here's a mathematical idea.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.140]   Now, how do you actually prove it?
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.900]   Well, you've got to watch, yes.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.340]   - Just a quick pause on that,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.900]   just the language you're using.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.000]   He found out.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.780]   - I can say he did a calculation.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.380]   - It's a really interesting notion
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.220]   that one of the most,
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.340]   one of the beautiful things about this universe
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.140]   is you can do a calculation
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.100]   and combine with some of that magical intuition
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.500]   that physicists have,
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.420]   actually predict what would be,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.820]   what's possible to experiment to validate.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.640]   - That's correct.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.660]   - So he found out in the sense that
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.500]   there seems to be something here
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.220]   and mathematically it should bend,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.700]   gravity should bend light this amount.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.540]   And so therefore that's something that could be potentially,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.540]   and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.580]   - Right.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.500]   And that's the way that actually modern physics,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.060]   deeply fundamental modern physics,
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.160]   this is how it works.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.620]   Earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.220]   So why did we go looking for it?
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:45.140]   The answer is that back in the late 60s, early 70s,
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.020]   some people wrote some equations
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.780]   and the equations predicted this.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.380]   So then we went looking for it.
