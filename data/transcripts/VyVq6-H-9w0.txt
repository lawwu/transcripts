[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   Eliza, a podcast listener from the Philippines, writes in, "Pastor John, thank you for your
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.000]   episode on praising others but not flattering them."
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.880]   That was episode number 719 in the archive.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.400]   "The flip side of flattery is where I find myself.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.720]   In receiving encouragement, I immediately question motives and assume that people are
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.480]   praising me only in order to get something from me, which is flattery, as you described.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560]   So how do I receive praise from others without doubting their motives?"
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.520]   Well, let's start with the biblical teaching that this kind of doubting or suspicion as
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   a habit is unloving and therefore wrong.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.680]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, verse 7, "Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800]   all things, endures all things."
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.160]   And the very least that Paul means when he says, "Love believes all things and hopes
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.760]   all things," the least that he means is that we should not be unduly suspicious about other
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.920]   people's motives.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.820]   Love hopes for the best from people, not the worst.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.160]   Love does to others what we would have done to us, and we don't like people to second-guess
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160]   our motives.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.040]   You don't like it when people impute to you motives that are not there, so you shouldn't
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.320]   do that to others either.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.820]   He probably already knows this, but we needed to put Bible behind it.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.920]   So what can we do if we find ourselves feeling these sinful suspicions when someone compliments
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.340]   or praises us?
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.480]   And I can think of at least four simple things.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.000]   One, this is a kind of anxiety, namely the anxiety that people's praise is not real praise,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   but manipulation.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.720]   They don't really think we're as good as they just said we are.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.760]   So Jesus' words about anxiety, I think in Matthew 6:27, apply here.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.420]   He says, "And which of you, by being anxious, can add a single hour to his span of life?"
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.640]   In other words, Jesus really did think that it would make a difference if we remind ourselves
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.880]   that this anxious suspicion of others' motives does no good.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.560]   It doesn't help us.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.180]   It doesn't add anything to our life.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.400]   It only makes relationships harder and not better.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.960]   Jesus thought that thinking that would help, so I think thinking it helps too, and I commend
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   it.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.600]   Don't do it because it's useless.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.240]   Number two, search your own heart.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:10.920]   Could it be that your suspicion of their ulterior motives of others is owing largely to the
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.000]   fact that you yourself are so prone to operate this way when you praise, and you are reading
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140]   your own motives into theirs?
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:34.220]   So increase your own habit of praising others whenever there's real reason to praise them,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.340]   just because you enjoy spilling over with admiration that you feel.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.780]   And let thankfulness overflow to God when somebody does something good in your presence.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.740]   Seek it out, and maybe the more you form the habit of praising others this way, the less
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.980]   you will automatically assume others would do anything differently for you.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.500]   I'm really preaching to myself when I say that, because I think most of the times when
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.380]   I'm reading negative things into people, it's because I've seen them in myself, and I suspect
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.780]   if I felt them, they are feeling them.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.620]   That's where that came from.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:25.580]   Number three, resolve that when someone praises you, you will return genuine thanks, but will
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.540]   not even think of some kind of payback that they could get from you.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.820]   You won't give them any payback.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.340]   And if they are after something, maybe your authentic gladness in receiving the praise
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.980]   minus any payback will dry up the ulterior motives, because they don't work.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.340]   Meanwhile, you get the pleasure of their praise without worrying about their motives.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.660]   And the last thing would be to cover all of this with prayer.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.060]   Pray and ask God to fill you with love and to take away the bent towards suspicion.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.300]   Thank you, Pastor John, for answering this follow-up question.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.140]   And we were talking earlier about APJ episode number 719, "How Do I Praise Others But Avoid
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.580]   Flattery?"
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.300]   You can check out that podcast in the archive at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.460]   Again, that was episode number 719.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.580]   Well, who is Jesus?
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.260]   That's a perennial question, and there must be as many diverse answers to that question
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.580]   as there is about any other person who ever walked on planet Earth.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.220]   We'll be looking at that question closer, and more importantly, we'll be looking at
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.220]   the answer tomorrow.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.820]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
