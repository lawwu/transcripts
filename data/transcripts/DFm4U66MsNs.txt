[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - We recently talked about the book you just wrote,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.120]   Pastor John, back on Thursday of last week.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.840]   You gave us a personal update.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.960]   In light of that, Brandon in Charlotte, North Carolina
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.800]   writes in to ask this.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.880]   Pastor John, thank you for your Christ-centered precision
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.560]   and for the tremendous volume of your ministry output.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.140]   I'm curious how you produce so much content.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.200]   What time do you wake up?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.240]   How do you find time to read and write?
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.920]   When do you eat your cereal?
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.480]   I mean, you mentioned your aversion to TV
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180]   and don't waste your life,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.080]   but what advice do you have for the daily schedule making
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.480]   to make the most of your life for Christ?
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.420]   - I think the first thing that I should say
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.660]   is beware of wanting to be like me.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.800]   You don't know the sins of my life.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   You don't know how much I have neglected.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.220]   You don't know what the costs have been.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.040]   The real question is how to be the fullest,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.080]   most God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.000]   loving, humble, mission-advancing,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   justice-seeking, others-serving person you, you can be.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100]   Don't measure yourself by others.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.100]   Measure yourself by your potential in Christ.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.300]   That's the first thing that I felt I had to say
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.120]   because of the way the question seemed to be posed.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.000]   Now, there are a lot of other things to say.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.720]   Let me tick 'em off.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   The second thing I would say is give 10% of your focus
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.120]   in life to avoiding obstacles to productivity,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.960]   and 90% of your focus to fastening onto great goals
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.320]   and pursuing them with all your might.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.080]   Very few people become productive
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.480]   by avoiding obstacles to productivity.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   It's not a good focus.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.040]   That's not where energy comes from.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.540]   It's not where vision comes from.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.600]   People write books about that and make a lot of money,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.540]   but that's not where anybody gets anything worthwhile done.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.420]   Getting things done that count come from great, glorious,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.260]   wonderful future possibilities that take you captive
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.100]   and draw your pursuit with all your might,
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.320]   and then all that other stuff
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.300]   about getting obstacles out of your way.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.700]   That's the 10% of broomwork that you have to do.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.120]   Third thing I wanna say.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.700]   Life comes to us in chapters
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.220]   that are very different from each other.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.740]   If you are married and have little children,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.660]   that's a chapter that needs a great deal
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.080]   of focus on the children.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.300]   If God wills, there may be another chapter for you
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.620]   with different possibilities,
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.220]   different potentials, and different priorities.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.980]   The Lord will be pleased if you focus
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.300]   on the chapter you're in and live according
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.780]   to the demands of that chapter with all your might.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660]   Fourth thing to say.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.380]   Give serious thought and prayer
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.640]   to what your big, all-consuming life goal is.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.420]   The biblical expression of mine is found in Philippians 1:20.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.340]   "It is my eager expectation."
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.440]   This is John Piper, not just Paul talking.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.180]   "It is my eager expectation and hope
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420]   "that I will not at all be ashamed,
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.060]   "but that with full courage."
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   Now, as always, "Christ will be magnified in my body,
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.460]   "whether by life or by death,
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.260]   "for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.940]   So Christ magnified in living and dying,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.860]   spreading a passion for that Christ
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.100]   into the lives of others.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.140]   That's the goal.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.860]   That's the big, overarching goal.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.860]   So find yours and make it work in everything you do.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.420]   Fifth, get a sense of gospel-rooted accountability
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.320]   before the living God.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.520]   That is, understand the gospel
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.040]   and the spiritual dynamics of how it works.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   You don't labor to get into a right relationship with God.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.500]   The gospel dynamics don't work that way.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   You labor morning till night with all your might
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.700]   because you are in a right relationship with God.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.940]   Philippians 2, "Work out your salvation
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.860]   "with fear and trembling,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   "for ground, basis, foundation, God is at work in you."
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.600]   That's the gospel dynamic.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.620]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am,
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.340]   "and His grace towards me was not in vain.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.860]   "But on the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.580]   "but it was not I.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.220]   "The grace of God had already taken up residence in me
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.500]   "and was at work in me."
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.200]   And if you get that order out of whack,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.020]   you may accomplish a lot in life
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.740]   and go straight to hell with all your books
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.360]   and all your buildings.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.340]   Let the Lord Jesus intensify this sense of accountability
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.860]   on the last day with the parable of the talents, right?
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.660]   Gave to one person five, gave to another person two,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.620]   gave to another person one, came to call a count,
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.460]   and the person with one heard those awful words.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.300]   You wicked and lazy servant.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.920]   I don't wanna hear that word.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.220]   I do not want to hear that word.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.760]   I want to experience the opposite,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.420]   the counterpart to those words from Luke 12.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.220]   "Who then is the faithful and wise manager
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.280]   "whom his master will set over his household?"
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.680]   I often thought those words when I was a pastor.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.880]   I was over a household.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   "To give them their portion of food at the proper time.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   "Blessed is that servant whom his master
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   "will find so doing when he comes."
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   I would be sitting preparing my messages
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.880]   or writing something or leading the family
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200]   in devotions or something, and I would say,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.120]   "Come now, Lord Jesus, and you'll find me doing it."
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.720]   That's the opposite of wicked, lazy servant,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.400]   buried your talent and didn't do anything with it.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.760]   So that's number five.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.360]   Number six, add to your sense of accountability
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   before God a sense of urgency.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.260]   "We must do the works of him who sent us while it is day.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.260]   "Night is coming when no one will work," John 9, 4.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.120]   Or Ephesians 5, "Look carefully how you walk,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.840]   "not as unwise, make redeeming," literally redeeming,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.360]   the time because the days are evil, or Colossians 4,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.940]   "Walk in wisdom towards those outside,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.240]   "make the best use of the time."
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.960]   There's urgency in this.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.160]   The days are evil and night is coming.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.920]   Seventh, do what you do with all your heart.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160]   Be done with half-heartedness.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.880]   Oh, so many people limp through life
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.600]   doing what they do with half of a heart,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.240]   half of their energy.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   If it's worth doing, it's worth doing with your whole soul.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.760]   Ecclesiastes 9, 10, "Whatever your hand finds to do,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.080]   "do it with your might."
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.680]   Jonathan Edwards' resolution,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   oh, probably had more impact on me
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.880]   in the last 30 years than anything else he said
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.400]   in his resolutions, at least, when he said,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   "Resolved to live with all my might while I live."
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.160]   Those words took hold of me a long time ago.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.800]   Oh, yes, Lord.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.320]   The opposite, the opposite of this,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.920]   14 times in the book of Proverbs,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.480]   the word sluggard is used.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.600]   Isn't that an ugly word?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.840]   Sluggard.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.080]   14 times, and what's a sluggard?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.220]   Chapter 20, verse 4,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.740]   "The sluggard does not plow in the autumn,
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740]   "and he will seek at harvest and have nothing."
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.460]   You don't wanna be a sluggard.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.460]   Number eight, "Many chops fell a huge tree."
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.540]   Man, this is so crucial because of how quickly
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.780]   we get discouraged after a thousand chops
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.180]   and the tree's not down yet.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.940]   I just finished listening to Robinson Crusoe.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.660]   You may say, "What in the world,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.540]   "what job, I've been listening to a teenage novel
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.100]   "for a, I've never heard some of these classics,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.300]   "so I'm listening to 'em."
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.320]   Robinson Crusoe, marooned on an island,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.020]   all by himself, wants to escape, needs a boat.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.540]   Mainland is 45 miles away, might be cannibals over there,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.700]   and not sure he wants to go, but he needs a boat.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.900]   He's got nothing else to do, so he's gonna make a boat.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.700]   He finds a tree.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.300]   This tree is five feet, 10 inches, I think,
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.980]   across at the bottom.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.780]   He has an ax.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.620]   It takes him, it takes him 22 days to chop this tree down,
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:36.060]   14 more days to chop the branches off,
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.460]   a year and a half to finish the boat with an ax.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.340]   I'd chop on a tree for a day or two days
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.500]   and say, "This tree's not coming down.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.340]   "I'm done with this tree.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.220]   "I'm gonna go work on some little tree."
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.260]   So there's the key, many chops fell a big tree.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.620]   Well, you wanna do something great?
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.260]   Don't quit, keep chopping.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.060]   Number nine, I got two more.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.060]   Number nine, be willing to do many things in life
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.860]   cheerfully that at first you don't wanna do.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.580]   They don't come naturally to you.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.100]   There is no worthwhile role in life
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.180]   that does not require you to do things
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.020]   you don't at first feel like doing
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.580]   or that only let you do what comes naturally.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.340]   So be cheerful, be cheerful in doing the parts of your life
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.340]   that you do not at first prefer to do.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.540]   And lastly, number 10, I should push it to make it 10
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.580]   so it'd be a nice round number.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.860]   Lastly, find your niche.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.700]   That is, find the thing you do love to do
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.060]   with all your weaknesses and all your strengths.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.420]   Put most of your energies and your love there
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.820]   for Christ and His kingdom.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.300]   - Wow, that is very helpful.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.100]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the counsel.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.700]   I've jotted down a number of these points
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.580]   for my own takeaway from my own life.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.620]   Thank you, and thank you for listening

[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.380]   if joy is something we fight for
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.580]   or if joy is something we wait for.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.540]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.140]   (upbeat music)

[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:33.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
