[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.580]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.280]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.020]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.280]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.640]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.260]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.700]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.000]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.340]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.340]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.600]   Well guys, I'm super excited to be with you again
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.200]   for another episode of our Summer Book Club series.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.440]   Today, we are going to be reading a couple of selections
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.800]   from "Ancient World Echoes",
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.360]   one of our Copper Lodge Library editions
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.160]   that is so perfect for family read-alouds.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.200]   Whether you do those first thing in the morning,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   snuggled up at the breakfast table,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.440]   or before nap time,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.980]   or last thing at night, cuddled up on the couch,
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.760]   they are excellent stories for enjoying as a family
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   and also for digging into some deeper conversations.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.460]   I always have people say,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.200]   "Yeah, but it's just so hard to make time for reading.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.900]   What's the big idea?"
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.180]   This is what I think.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.980]   Reading aloud can be relaxing.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.340]   It can be informative,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.200]   but it can also be sort of magical.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Myths and poems and fables and fairy tales,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   all of those kinds of stories allow us to think about
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.440]   long, long ago and far, far away and once upon a time
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   in ways that are somehow thrilling to our imaginations,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.820]   our kids' imaginations and our own.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.820]   These stories of beginnings are really intriguing to us.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.200]   We all like to be in on things from the beginning.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.600]   It helps us feel connected and in the know.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.200]   It helps us feel powerful and part of the magic.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   Listen, you and your children can thrill together
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000]   over stories from long ago and far away this summer
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   by enjoying "Ancient World Echoes."
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.580]   The stories collected in this Copper Lodge Library volume
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.940]   are tales from when the world was new.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.840]   They're origin stories.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.320]   A lot of the stories explain the world
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   and its creatures and its peoples.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.760]   These are important tales for several reasons.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.640]   In this volume, we are gonna read stories
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.340]   that helped make sense of the world
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.280]   that early people experienced.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.100]   And a lot of these stories explain natural phenomenon
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.900]   and animal habits.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.200]   These kinds of stories appeal to your little kids.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.300]   You have tons of questions about why things are
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.880]   the way they are and how they got to be that way.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.280]   They appeal to everybody's desire to know why
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.200]   when we look at the world.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.120]   And the stories will draw your attention
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.640]   to the natural world and call us to explore.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.920]   It's a great activity for families to enjoy together,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.400]   reading about the world and then letting it
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   pique your interest to go out and explore together.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.440]   The stories in "Ancient World Echoes"
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   help us confront our own frailties and our own failings too.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   Reading these stories, we learn lessons in humility
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.120]   and lessons in honor, lessons in kindness,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   as the characters in the stories experience hard lessons.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.000]   Sometimes we're just encouraged and soothed
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.800]   by stories of rescue and redemption.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.360]   You know, if it could happen in a story,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.400]   it could happen to me.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   So the intro to "Ancient World Echoes" says it best.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.040]   And so I want to read a couple of pages,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   well, an excerpt for you from page 12,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.660]   near the bottom over to the very top of page 13.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.220]   By sharing these stories as a family,
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.080]   we can grow young again and share in the truth,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   goodness, and beauty of childhood.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   We can be filled with wonder and worship again.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   We can see the right path to pursue,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.040]   the path that leads to mercy and justice.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.180]   The echoes of fairy tales are perhaps more needed
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.640]   in our day than ever before.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   Our children are being raised in a culture
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.840]   that tells them every individual should decide
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   what is best for themselves.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.320]   Fairy tales argue that virtue lies in the common good
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   and often makes us subdue our whims and passions
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.240]   in order to love our neighbors well.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.160]   Because there was a break in the tradition,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.240]   sometimes our culture echoes the past
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.880]   without knowing what it means.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   Let us reject this world in which everything is echo
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.600]   with no substance.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   Rather, let us embrace the old tradition of fairy tales,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.640]   which argued that the world is a mysterious place.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.400]   The ability to accept the mystery
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.240]   nurtures faith, hope, and love.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.720]   Like little children, we must believe that miracles happen
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.360]   and that the unseen is palpably real.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.320]   As my friend Jen argues, postmodernism says
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.720]   we only ever see in a glass darkly.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.320]   Scripture tells us that we only see
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.880]   in a glass darkly temporarily.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.160]   Remember, too, that the echo is not an end,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.600]   it's a beginning.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.280]   We can keep it running through the ages,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   but it will fade unless we take up the chant again.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.040]   It is my prayer that this book will start the echo
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   for a new generation,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.600]   for although the times and people change,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.760]   the echoes of truth, goodness, and beauty
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.840]   will continue to reverberate through the ages.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.040]   That's an encouragement for you guys to dig into
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.640]   the fairy tales and the fables
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.760]   that "Ancient World Echoes" offers
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.560]   as family read aloud time.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:47.000]   Now, I'm gonna read a couple of the stories
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.120]   in "Ancient World Echoes."
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.880]   So call your children if you want to.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.000]   And then after the stories, we'll go back
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.320]   and we will suggest some questions,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   some ways that you could savor this book with your kids.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:10.560]   All right, I want to share with you today
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.040]   a story from "Ancient World Echoes,"
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.600]   a Copper Lodge Library edition.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.640]   And first of all, I want to share with you the story
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   how the birds saved the emperor's life,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.280]   a tale from China.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.000]   There was once an emperor of China
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.200]   whose palace was the most wonderful in the world,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   being built entirely of priceless porcelain.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.520]   In the garden were the most beautiful flowers,
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.400]   on some of which were little golden bells
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.080]   which tinkled in the wind
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.920]   so that you could not help looking at them.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.600]   It was a really wonderful garden and so large
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.680]   that even the head gardener himself
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.560]   did not know where it ended.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.960]   If you should reach the end of the garden,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.160]   you would come to a magnificent forest
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.960]   in which were great trees and deep lakes.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.440]   The banks sloped down to the water,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.840]   which was as clear as crystal.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.600]   Overhanging the lake were the boughs of some trees
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   which were so large that ships could sail beneath them.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.680]   In one of these trees there lived a nightingale
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   which sang so beautifully that a poor fisherman
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.320]   who had a great deal to do even stopped his work
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.840]   to listen to the birds singing.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   "How beautiful it is," he said,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.080]   but he had to attend to his duties
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.280]   and then forgot about the bird.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.680]   But each night it was the same.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.800]   The fisherman could not resist the temptation
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.040]   and he left his work to listen to the bird.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.000]   The emperor's palace and garden were so magnificent
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.800]   that many travelers from foreign countries
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   wrote books describing their beauty.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.200]   But every scholar who wrote said
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   that the finest thing of all was the singing
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.920]   of this nightingale.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.360]   These books were read by many people all over the world
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.160]   and at last some of them reached the emperor
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.480]   who sat in his chair of solid jade
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.280]   and read and read and read.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.120]   He was very much pleased that so many people
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.280]   who were scholars should write so much
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.880]   about his palace and garden.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.280]   But he was surprised to find that in each book
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.480]   the nightingale was spoken of as the finest
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.980]   and perhaps most wonderful thing of all.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.000]   "It is very strange," said the emperor.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.960]   "I've never heard this nightingale
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.240]   "and it does seem unusual that I should know about it
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   "for the first time from reading books written by travelers."
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.260]   He called his first lord to him and said,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.160]   "In all of these books there's mention
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   "of a very remarkable bird
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.260]   "which is called the nightingale.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.120]   "The writers all say that it's the most glorious thing
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.640]   "in my kingdom.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.040]   "How is it that no one has ever told me about it?"
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   "Why, I don't know anything about it myself,"
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.140]   said the first lord.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.560]   "But I will go and find out."
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.200]   The first lord didn't know where it was,
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.420]   so he ran all over the palace and asked everybody there,
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.660]   but none of them had ever heard of the nightingale.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.720]   Then he returned to the emperor and said,
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.640]   "It must be an invention of those who had written the books.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.620]   "Your royal highness must know
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.320]   "that not all that is written is true
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.060]   "and that much of it is invented," said he.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.680]   "But the last book I read," said the emperor,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.000]   "was sent to me by the great ruler of Japan
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.980]   "so that it must be true.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.780]   "And I insist upon your bringing the nightingale
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.600]   "here this evening.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.140]   "If you do not, everyone in this palace
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.700]   "shall be trampled under foot."
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.880]   "All right, your majesty," said the first lord,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.920]   and he ran up and down the stairs,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.960]   through the halls and corridors,
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.540]   and as he told the people what would happen to them
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.600]   if the nightingale were not brought there that evening,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.360]   they all followed him because they had no wish
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.280]   to be trampled under foot and all were most anxious
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.580]   to know about this wonderful nightingale,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.040]   which it seemed that everybody in the world knew about,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.520]   except those who lived in the palace.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.780]   At last, they met a poor little girl in the kitchen
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.160]   who said, "Why, I know the nightingale,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.680]   "and I've often heard her sing.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.300]   "Every night when I go home to my mother,
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.600]   "I'm so tired that I sit and rest
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.940]   "for a little while in the wood,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.060]   "and then I hear the nightingale sing,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.300]   "and it is so wonderful
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.800]   "that it always brings tears to my eyes."
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.120]   "Then," said the first lord, little kitchen maid,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.780]   "if you can lead us to this nightingale,
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.620]   "you shall have leave to see the emperor
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.760]   "at dinner this evening,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.980]   "for she is invited by his majesty
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.140]   "to come and sing to him."
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.960]   Then they all went into the garden
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.640]   where the nightingale lived,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.780]   and on the way, they heard the mooing of a cow.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.840]   "Oh, this must be the nightingale.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.040]   "How wonderful that such a little bird
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.680]   "has such a tremendous voice," said they.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.880]   "That is not a bird singing.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.480]   "That's a cow mooing," said the little kitchen maid.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.660]   "We have a long way to go yet."
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.000]   A little farther on,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.320]   they heard some frogs croaking in the marsh.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   The Chinese chaplain was with them,
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.780]   and he said, "How sublime.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.040]   "That is just like the ringing of a church bell."
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.780]   "Why," said the little kitchen maid,
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.520]   "those are frogs croaking."
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   "But very soon, we shall hear her."
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.100]   Just then, the nightingale began to sing.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.700]   "Hark!" cried the little girl.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.080]   "Listen!"
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.520]   And pointing to a little bird sitting up in the branches,
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.840]   said, "There she is."
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.960]   "It doesn't seem possible
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.800]   "that so very common-looking a bird like that can sing,"
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.380]   said the first lord.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.960]   "It must be that she has lost her brilliant plumage
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.300]   "because there's so many distinguished people here."
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.500]   Then the little kitchen maid called out,
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.080]   "Little nightingale, our gracious emperor invites you
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.000]   "to sing before him this evening."
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.420]   "It will give me great pleasure to do so,"
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.140]   said the nightingale.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.740]   And then she began to sing so gloriously
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.420]   that they were all entranced.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.940]   The first lord said,
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.900]   "I've never heard anything so beautiful before.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.820]   "His majesty will be delighted."
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.620]   The nightingale, thinking the first lord was the emperor,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.860]   said, "Shall I sing again for you, your majesty?"
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.100]   "My dear little bird," said the first lord.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.900]   "His most gracious highness has sent me to invite you
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.800]   "to his palace this evening
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.900]   "so that he may listen to your charming song."
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.300]   "Oh, it's much better out here in the forest,"
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.020]   replied the nightingale.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.460]   But when she heard that the emperor wished her
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.380]   to go to the palace, she gladly offered to go with them.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.900]   At the palace, everything was splendidly prepared.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.180]   The many lights made the porcelain walls and floors glitter
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.260]   and the gorgeous tinkling flowers helped
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.380]   to make the place look very beautiful.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.380]   The people moving back and forth
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.100]   caused the little golden bells to tinkle all the time.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.340]   In the center of the great hall,
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.580]   in which was the emperor's throne,
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.500]   was a golden perch put there for the nightingale.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.320]   The whole court was present and the little kitchen maid,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.620]   who had shown the first lord where the bird could be found,
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.860]   was allowed to stand behind the door
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.780]   where she could see and hear everything.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.020]   All were dressed in their best clothes
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.700]   and everyone looked toward the little bird
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.540]   whom the emperor requested to commence singing.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.420]   And how the nightingale did sing!
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.140]   Very soon, the tears came into the emperor's eyes
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.340]   and ran down his cheeks.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.300]   At this, the nightingale sang even more beautifully
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.360]   and the heart of everyone was touched.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.260]   The emperor was so delighted that he said
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.040]   she should wear the golden necklace around her neck.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.220]   But the nightingale said that she had already received
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.980]   a sufficient reward, for she had brought tears
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.100]   to the eyes of the emperor.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.620]   Even the servants, who were always
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.700]   the most difficult to please,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.480]   said that they were greatly touched.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.340]   This in itself proved how successful
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.020]   was the nightingale's concert.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.060]   The emperor requested her to stay at the court
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.700]   and he gave her a large golden cage
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.860]   and allowed her to go out twice every day.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.940]   He provided her with 12 servants,
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.620]   each of whom held a silken string,
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.660]   which was fastened to her leg,
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.580]   and you may be sure that she found
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.140]   but little pleasure flying about, hampered in this way.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.900]   Very soon, everyone in the city was talking
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.460]   about the wonderful bird and even the tradesman's children
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.500]   were all named after her,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.540]   although none of them could sing a note.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.660]   Sometime after this, the emperor received a large parcel
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.260]   on which was written, "The Nightingale."
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.260]   "This must be another book about our famous bird,"
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.020]   said the emperor, but he was mistaken,
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.980]   for it was a mechanical toy, an artificial nightingale,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   which looked something like a real bird,
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.580]   but was covered with jewels.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.300]   When it was wound up, it could sing the piece
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.980]   the real bird sang and moved its tail up and down.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.000]   Around its neck was a collar on which was written,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.060]   "The Nightingale of the Emperor of Japan
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.540]   cannot be compared with that of the Emperor of China."
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.620]   "How wonderful," said everyone,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.260]   and the man who had brought the clockwork bird
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.660]   was given the title of bringer
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.440]   of the imperial first nightingale.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.460]   They sang together, but it did not sound well,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.080]   for the real nightingale sang her own song
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.000]   and the clockwork bird sang Waltz's.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.760]   "It isn't its fault," said the bandmaster.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.400]   "It keeps very good time and is quite after my style."
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.660]   Then the artificial bird had to sing alone.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.400]   It was very pleasant to listen to,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.940]   and it was also pretty to look at,
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.660]   as the jewels with which it was covered sparkled so.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.180]   It sang the same piece many times without becoming tired,
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.140]   and then the emperor thought
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.920]   that the real nightingale should sing again,
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.220]   but she was not to be found.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.940]   The window was open, and without anybody seeing her go,
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.680]   she had flown away to her beloved forest.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.660]   The emperor was very angry when it was discovered
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.020]   that the real bird had gone away,
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.460]   and everyone agreed that it was a very ungracious thing
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.180]   for her to have done,
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.500]   but they all said that the bird sent by the Japanese ruler
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.300]   was the better of the two,
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.740]   and especially did the bandmaster praise it.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.900]   He said that one knew just what to expect
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.260]   from the artificial bird,
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.260]   but the real one would sing the most unusual tunes.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.780]   The bird they had now could be opened,
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.500]   and the inside shown and explained,
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.820]   but if this were done to the other, it would die.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.060]   Everyone agreed that what the bandmaster said was correct,
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.500]   and the emperor commanded that all the people of the city
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.840]   should be allowed to listen to the bird's beautiful music
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.620]   on a certain day of the following week.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.300]   So on the day appointed,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.020]   the bandmaster showed the jeweled bird to the people,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.780]   and after they had heard it sing,
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.020]   everyone said that its music was wonderful.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.540]   That is, all but the poor fisherman
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.140]   who had heard the real one,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.980]   and he said, "This one looks very pretty,
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.980]   "and is quite pleasant to listen to,
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.600]   "but its singing does not compare with that of the other."
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.540]   The emperor banished the real bird from the kingdom,
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.400]   and the artificial one was put on a golden perch
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.260]   by the side of his bed and given the title
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.040]   of Imperial Night Singer.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.620]   Several months passed away when one evening,
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.540]   as the emperor lay in bed listening to it,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.600]   something inside snapped, and the music stopped.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.940]   The royal physician was summoned but could do nothing.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.100]   Then the royal clockmaker was called,
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.340]   and after examining it very carefully,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.080]   he took out the works, which he found to be almost worn out.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.040]   It took him quite a long time to put these back again,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.360]   but at last he got it into something like order,
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.480]   although he said it must not be used more than once a year,
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.660]   and then only for a very short time.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.080]   Sometime after this, the emperor became ill, very ill,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.720]   and as the physician said that he could not live
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   for more than a few days, his successor was chosen.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.240]   The poor emperor lay all alone in his great bed,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.960]   and as everyone believed him to be dead,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.460]   the courtiers left him to pay their respects
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.520]   to the new ruler.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.440]   But he was only in a trance, and when he came out of this,
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.960]   he felt very lonely indeed,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.040]   for there was no one to speak to him.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.880]   He turned his head and saw the artificial bird
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.800]   by his bedside.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.840]   A great longing for music came over him,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.560]   and he cried, "Sing, golden bird, please sing!"
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.440]   But there was no one to wind it up,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   and he was too weak to do this himself.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   It was so quiet, and he felt so terribly lonely and sad
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.000]   that he was sure he was going to die.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.640]   Suddenly, there came through the open window
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.000]   the sound of such beautiful music
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.120]   that new life came to the sick man.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.520]   He raised his head and saw,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.160]   sitting upon the bough of a large tree,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.080]   the real bird whom he had banished from his kingdom.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.380]   "What divine singing," said the emperor.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.080]   "You have given me new life in return for my unkindness
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.880]   in banishing you from my kingdom.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.320]   What can I do to reward you?"
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   "I need no more reward than the sight of the tears
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.240]   which came to your eyes when I first sang to you,"
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.900]   said the nightingale.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.000]   "That is something which I can never forget.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.920]   But now you must sleep,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.240]   and tomorrow, when you will feel much stronger,
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.400]   I can promise you such music
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.320]   as you would not possibly believe."
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.960]   The emperor smiled happily
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.240]   and fell at once into a deep, calm sleep.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.400]   He was awakened in the morning by the sun,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   which was shining brightly.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.720]   So much better did he feel
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.640]   that he was able to get out of bed
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   and walk to the open window,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.360]   and there his eyes beheld a wonderful sight.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.840]   Upon every bough of the tree in front of him
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.580]   were perched many birds,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.520]   and in the center of them sat the poor fisherman
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.120]   who held to his lips a reed instrument.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   On seeing the emperor at the window,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.200]   he gave a sign,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.300]   and there came forth from the throats
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.640]   of the assembled birds such a glorious burst of melody
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.460]   that tears of thankfulness flowed from the emperor's eyes.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.520]   He could scarcely believe
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.320]   that such wonderful music was possible.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.000]   No longer was he a sick man.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.880]   The bird chorus had brought back to him
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.960]   the health and strength which all the doctors,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.680]   with their medicines, had not been able to do.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.880]   In his gratitude to the birds,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.200]   he gave them the tree for their very own,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   and the poor fisherman he appointed bandmaster in chief.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:39.000]   Wasn't that a great story?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.440]   I loved to hear about the birds,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.400]   the nightingale, the real one,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.240]   and the artificial one.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.000]   We'll talk in a minute about how you and your family
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.060]   can enjoy that story together,
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.400]   but I want to share one more story
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.100]   from "Ancient World Echoes."
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.520]   This is an Aesop's fable,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.440]   and it is called "The Bees and Wasps and the Hornet."
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:12.200]   A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   and the wasps declared positively that it belonged to them.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   The bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.440]   The argument grew very pointed,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.520]   and it looked as if the affair could not be settled
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.000]   without a battle, when at last, with much good sense,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.440]   they agreed to let a judge decide the matter.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.360]   So they brought the case before the hornet,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.040]   justice of the peace in that part of the woods.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.520]   When the judge called the case,
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.200]   the witnesses declared that they had seen
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.400]   certain winged creatures in the neighborhood
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.240]   of the hollow tree who hummed loudly,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:02.240]   and whose bodies were striped yellow and black like bees.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.560]   Counsel for the wasps immediately insisted
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.800]   that this description fitted his clients exactly.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.000]   Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.160]   so he adjourned the court for six weeks
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.960]   to give him time to think it over.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   When the case came up again,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.800]   both sides had a large number of witnesses.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   An aunt was the first to take the stand,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.040]   and was about to be cross-examined
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   when a wise old bee addressed the court.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   Your honor, he said, the case has now been pending
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.880]   for six weeks.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.800]   If it is not decided soon,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.760]   the honey will not be fit for anything.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.200]   I move that the bees and the wasps
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.760]   be both instructed to build a honeycomb.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.740]   The wasps protested loudly.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:18.740]   A wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.920]   They knew they could not build a honeycomb
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.240]   and fill it with honey.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.920]   It is clear, said the judge,
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.600]   who made the comb and who could not have made it.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.080]   The honey belongs to the bees.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   The lesson, ability proves itself by deeds.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:50.400]   A short story, all of the fables are very short,
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.900]   but they teach us really good lessons.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.600]   They give us lots to think about.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.640]   And that's why we want to take time, parents,
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.880]   to savor the stories that you share with your children.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.500]   It is fun just to read a quick story and enjoy it.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.080]   And laugh about it together.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.640]   And wait to see how it turns out.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.520]   And pick the characters that we want to succeed.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.480]   And pick the characters that we know are the bad guys
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.880]   and root against them.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   But it's even more fun to savor the story a little bit.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.400]   To draw it out, to talk about it some more.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.200]   So you can always go back and ask your children
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.700]   who was in the story?
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.900]   Tell me, let's name all the characters.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.860]   And you could name them and count them out on your fingers.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.300]   You could name them and draw a little picture on a bookmark
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.280]   so that you would have all the characters.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.020]   You could even put the name of every character
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.580]   on a popsicle stick and hold up the correct stick
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.700]   when you read the story next time
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.260]   when it comes to that character.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.700]   So you can ask who was in the story
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.300]   and who are all the characters,
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.900]   the big characters and the small characters.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.420]   Your children will be able to tell you perhaps
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.860]   what the characters look like.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.920]   Sometimes we don't get a description
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.500]   of what the characters look like.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.060]   In "How the Bird Saved the Emperor's Life" for instance,
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.980]   there's not really much of a description
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.700]   of the head gardener or the fisherman.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.780]   But I bet you that your children have an idea.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.300]   So ask them, what do you think this character look like?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.580]   How tall do you think this character was?
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.140]   Do you think he was young or old?
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.420]   What color hair did he have?
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.780]   And if you're reading a story from a different time
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.040]   or a different place, you can say,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.140]   what do you think the character's clothes looked like?
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.020]   Were they like yours or different?
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.560]   What colors do you think his clothes might have been?
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.980]   All these kinds of surface details are great
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.780]   for diving in to the story.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.020]   And you can ask imagination questions.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.300]   What do you think the weather was like in China?
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.620]   What do you think, was it spring or was it summer?
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.180]   Is it cool or warm?
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.780]   And what kind of weather do they have?
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.860]   Do you think it was rainy?
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.280]   Do you think it was cold?
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.640]   You can ask all those kinds of questions.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   You can even ask, what do you think it would be like
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.240]   to be a fisherman who had to fish every day,
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.500]   not fish when he wanted to?
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.420]   So what might the characters have felt like?
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.580]   What kind of jobs does a gardener have?
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.340]   What kind of job is emperor?
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.420]   You could ask them, what does an emperor wear?
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.980]   And what does a gardener wear?
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.540]   And what does a fisherman wear?
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.940]   And how did their clothes fit their jobs?
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.220]   You could ask your children to retell the story.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.440]   So this kind of is a way of narrating the plot of a story.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.740]   What happened first, and what happened next,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.580]   and what happened next, and what happened at the end?
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.060]   Tell me about the story.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.940]   It's always nice, especially in some of these origin stories,
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.100]   these beginning stories, what is the conflict?
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.300]   What's the main struggle that the character has?
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.100]   In the case of the story that we read about the birds,
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.400]   how the birds saved the emperor's life,
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.740]   what was the problem that the bird solved at the end?
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.940]   How did the bird save the emperor's life?
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.820]   The bird was not a doctor,
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.100]   and he didn't have any medicine.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.780]   What was wrong with the emperor
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.340]   that a bird could save his life?
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.060]   So you could talk about what's the main struggle
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.100]   of all the different characters.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.360]   What was the main struggle of the bird
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.500]   once the bird came to live with the emperor?
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.380]   What lessons did the characters in the story learn?
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.780]   And is there a lesson for us?
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.480]   These are all great questions to ask about the story.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.180]   You could ask your children
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.980]   to draw a poster of the story.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.140]   I used to love to make dioramas,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.380]   take a shoe box and make everything,
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.380]   a scene from the story in miniature inside the shoe box,
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.700]   and it was my shadow box.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.480]   You could, as I said before, use Popsicle sticks.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.340]   You could make paperback puppets
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:02.300]   and have a puppet show of one of the stories from today.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.260]   You could have your student,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.280]   have your child recite the story again.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.480]   You could have them act it out or draw a picture.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   You could even have them make a replica of the nightingale.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.200]   What would they use to make a bird
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.140]   that would look like the real nightingale?
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.260]   And what would they use to make a bird
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.760]   that looks like the artificial nightingale?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.360]   And how would we be able to tell them apart?
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.280]   You can even use one of the five common topics of comparison.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.480]   You could compare all of the ways
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.860]   in which the real nightingale
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.780]   and the artificial nightingale were alike,
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.960]   and then all the ways that they were different.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.860]   What made the real nightingale special?
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.000]   And what made the artificial nightingale special?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.760]   You could even vote in your family
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.440]   on which bird your family likes the best.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   All children love to tell stories,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.000]   and these origin stories a lot of times give them an idea
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.160]   of telling their beginning story.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.760]   So many of your children, of course,
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.800]   don't remember when they were born,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.160]   but they remember hearing stories
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.920]   about when they were born.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.560]   You could have a grand time
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   asking every child in your family,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.200]   parents too, to write down stories
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.000]   about when they were very, very small.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.760]   And you may even ask them to write a story
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   that would explain how they came to be as they are now.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.360]   This could be a great rainy day activity,
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.880]   a great vacation activity,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.360]   or just a really fun way to spend an evening,
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.140]   and think how grandparents would love to receive a book
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.800]   of those stories for a Christmas gift.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.840]   I hope that you and your family will spend some time
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.440]   this summer reading aloud together,
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.520]   and more than just reading the stories,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.200]   I hope that you will savor them.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.640]   Parents, if you want to learn more
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   about how to be a classical educator,
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.840]   I wanna encourage you,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.000]   because we at Classical Conversations
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.880]   really believe that parents can provide
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.240]   the quality education they want their children to have.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.320]   We know that parents sometimes feel unsure
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.240]   about how to accomplish this goal,
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.440]   so if you are eager to learn
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.200]   how to be a better classical educator,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   our Classical Learning Cohort Program can help.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.080]   Think about it this summer,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   and go to classicalconversations.com/cohort
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   and find out some ways that you can grow
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.920]   as the lead learner in your home.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.600]   Thank you for being with me today,
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.720]   and I will see you next week with some more stories.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.560]   Bye-bye.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.360]   (gentle music)
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.420]   you
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
