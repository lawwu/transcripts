[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Josiah Y asked this very good question.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.920]   What is the LSB's rationale in sometimes using saints
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.600]   and sometimes holy one or holy ones?
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.720]   It's actually the same Greek word.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   Well, I think if you trace through there,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   the times that we use saints, it refers to God's people.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.620]   The times we use holy one or holy ones,
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.680]   it refers to the Lord himself as the holy one
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.540]   or angels as holy ones.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.520]   It's the same Greek word, but to distinguish between them,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.600]   when it's hagioi is the word,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.400]   when it's believers, we call them saints.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.760]   When it's I am the holy one, God says,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   we refer to him as the holy one.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000]   And when the angels are referred to as holy ones,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.120]   we kept that translation,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.000]   But when it refers to believers, we used saints.
