[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660]   Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets.
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.840]   Serfs produce a surplus which the Lord gets.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.640]   Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.040]   It's very simple.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   These are exploitative class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.120]   appropriated by another group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.560]   enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.880]   class struggle.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.520]   The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.700]   philosophers in the world.
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.360]   This is a heavy topic.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.180]   In general and for me personally, given my family history in the Soviet Union, in Russia,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180]   and in Ukraine.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.060]   Today the words Marxism, Socialism, and Communism are used to attack and to divide, much more
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.340]   than to understand and to learn.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.780]   With this podcast, I seek the latter.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.300]   I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx, as well as their various implementations
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.820]   throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.260]   And in general, we need to both steel man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.780]   and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200]   and at times dangerous.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.940]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.780]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.260]   And now, dear friends, here's Richard Wolff.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.980]   Let's start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.980]   What is Marxism?
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.540]   What are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.620]   Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:18.100]   its founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:27.400]   But because these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did, and as globally
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.420]   as they did, literally it's 140 years since Marx died, and in that time his ideas have
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.820]   become major types of thinking in every country on the earth.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.260]   If you know much about the great ideas of human history, that's an extraordinary spread
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.700]   in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.420]   And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:12.420]   Marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories,
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.220]   and economic conditions, so the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.660]   in different places at different times.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.820]   And therefore Marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all of
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.140]   these very different ways of coming to terms with it.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:46.060]   For the first roughly 40-50 years, Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.220]   capitalism.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.900]   Marx himself, that's all he really did.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660]   He never wrote a book about communism.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.980]   He never wrote a book really about socialism either.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.040]   His comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.060]   What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism, and that's what Marxism
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.660]   was, more or less, in its first 40 or 50 years.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.220]   few weeks.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.660]   In 1871, there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.220]   Bismarck's Germany, and in the result was something called the Paris Commune.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.780]   The working class of Paris rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.820]   economy and the Parisian society.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.320]   And Marx's people, people influenced by Marx, were very active in that commune, in the leadership
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.820]   of the commune.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.060]   And Marx wasn't that far away.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.540]   He was in London.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.300]   These things were happening in Paris.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.700]   That's an easy transport even then.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.320]   And for a short time, very short, Marxism had a different quality.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.860]   In addition to being a critique of capitalism, it became a theory of how to organize society
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.420]   differently.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.500]   Before that had only been implicit.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.960]   Now it became explicit.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.900]   What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do, and why, and in what order?
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.660]   In other words, governing, organizing a society.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.860]   But since it only lasted a few weeks, the French army regrouped, and under the leadership
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.740]   of people who were very opposed to Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.540]   a large number of the communards, as they were called, and deported them to islands
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.660]   in the Pacific that were part of the French Empire at the time.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.140]   The really big change happens in Russia in 1917.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:13.220]   Now you have a group of Marxists, Lenin, Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.660]   to seize a moment.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:23.180]   Once again, a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.860]   a very bad reputation, because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.980]   you know, Brest-Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses, and the army revolts.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:45.780]   And in that situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers'
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:56.380]   Party, splits under the pressures of all of this, into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.620]   Lenin, Trotsky, and the others are in the Bolshevik division.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.820]   And to make a long story short, he's in exile.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:11.660]   Lenin's position gets him deported, because he says Russian workers should not be killing
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.660]   German workers.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.540]   This is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into colonies, and Russian working
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.920]   people should not kill and should not die for such a thing.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.340]   As you can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.980]   Interestingly, in the United States, the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.700]   here, as you know, there was no Communist Party at this point, that comes later, the
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:46.260]   head of the Socialist Party, a very important American figure named Eugene Victor Debs,
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.940]   makes exactly the same argument that Americans should not fight in the war.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.380]   He's in the past, he has nothing to do with Lenin, I don't even know if they knew of each
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.820]   other, but he does it on his own.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.860]   He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:08.540]   By the way, he runs for president from jail and does very well, really very well, remarkable.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.060]   And he's the inspiration for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.460]   Although he had much more courage politically than Bernie has.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.780]   That's really interesting, I'd love to return to that link maybe later.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.420]   History rhymes.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.660]   Yes, the complicated story.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:33.500]   Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now this seizure of power by a group
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.220]   of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx, developing what you might call a
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:47.580]   Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians too, but a Russian interpretation.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:55.300]   This now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least, what
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.620]   are you going to do in the Soviet Union?
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.380]   And a lot of this was then trial and error.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.340]   Marx never laid any of this out.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.580]   Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, because it was 50 years earlier
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.260]   in another country, etc.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.620]   So what begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then more later in China
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:24.980]   and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifurcation.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:33.940]   Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:41.420]   a set, and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative post-capitalist
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.420]   society ought to look like, how it ought to work.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:52.380]   And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion, and I would say that that's
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.660]   still where it is.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:00.420]   You have a tradition now that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.220]   of the alternative, and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.420]   in which I would answer that's what Marxism is about.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:17.940]   Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society can do better than capitalism,
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.820]   and it ought to try.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.140]   And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.540]   Fine.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.220]   So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back, what
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:37.380]   do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:45.580]   of Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.380]   Would he shake his head?
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.620]   Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations?
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.940]   How do you think he would analyze it?
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.420]   Well, he had a great sense of humor.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.120]   I don't know if you've had a chance to take a look at his writing, but he had an extraordinary
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   sense of humor.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.420]   So my guess is he would deploy his humor in answering this question, too.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.460]   He would say some of them are inspiring, some of the interpretations of his work, and he's
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.420]   very pleased with those.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.320]   Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.620]   things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:29.540]   There's a German word—I don't know if you speak the other languages—there's a wonderful
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:35.660]   German word called "verzichte," and it's stronger than the word "refuse."
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.460]   If you want to refuse something but with real strong emphasis, "ich verzichte darauf"
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.380]   is a German way of saying, "I don't want anything to do with that."
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.860]   And he would talk then in philosophical terms, because remember, he was a student of philosophy.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.020]   He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.500]   He would wax philosophical and say that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.860]   a child.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:10.380]   You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.700]   his or her own way, and these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.020]   - And as you said, there's a particular way that this idea spread.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.740]   The speed at which it spread throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.620]   stabilized and connected back to the origins of where the idea came from.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:36.020]   - The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians after the revolution, because
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.300]   they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they occupied a position for
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.500]   a while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right?
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.740]   There had been all these people criticizing capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.700]   ever since mid-century, and these were the first guys who pulled it off.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.620]   They made it, and so that there was a kind of presumption around the world, their interpretation
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.540]   must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:17.500]   And so for a while, they could enunciate their interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   as something which, by the way, gets called in the literature "official Marxism."
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:29.220]   The very idea that you would put that adjective in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:35.900]   Marx, there were these words where the adjective was meant to somehow say kind of this is the
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.220]   canon.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.580]   You can depart from it, but this is the canon.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:47.820]   Before the Russian Revolution, there was no such thing, and by the 1960s, it was already
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.540]   displayed, it was gone.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:57.420]   But for a short time, 30, 40 years, it was a kind of, and the irony is, particularly
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.860]   here in the United States, where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:11.580]   War II, is so total in this country that I, for example, through most of my adult life,
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:20.300]   have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to American audiences
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:28.420]   that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.500]   canon before 1917 and hasn't been since at least the 1960s.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.420]   But they don't know.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.340]   It's not that they're stupid, and it's not that they're ignorant.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   It's that, well, the ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not a mental problem.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.220]   It's the taboo.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:52.820]   Cut it down, and so all of the reopening that in a way recaptures what went before
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.260]   and develops it in new direction, they just don't know.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.620]   Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.380]   The Russians, the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century made a serious attempt
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.740]   at saying, "Okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this?"
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.820]   And so in that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it's interesting
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.060]   to look at those particular schools.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.060]   Maybe-
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.520]   Right, because for example, let me just take your point one step further.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.300]   You really cannot understand the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, Vietnamese, and the
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:42.700]   others, because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.780]   did it.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.580]   Are you going to do it that way?
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.740]   Well, yes and no is the answer.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.740]   This we will do that way, but that we're not going to do.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.700]   And the differences are huge, but you could find a thread, I can do that for you if you
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:03.180]   want, in which all of them are in a way reacting.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.180]   They are-
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.180]   To the originals.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.300]   Yes, very much so.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.260]   Maybe most of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.100]   Something like that.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.780]   Can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism?
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:25.420]   So we got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even, let's expand out to Maoism.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:35.100]   So maybe I could speak to Leninism, and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:42.060]   I think for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small, sort of vanguard party,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:49.340]   like a small controlling entity that's wise and is able to do the central planning decisions.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:56.420]   Then for Stalinism, one interesting, Stalin's implementation of all of this, one interesting
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:04.540]   characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal of Marxism to make it
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.780]   all about nation, nationalism, the strength of nation.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:18.100]   And then, so Maoism is, it's different in that it's focused on agriculture, on rural.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.060]   And then Trotskyism, I don't know, except that it's anti-Stalin.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.420]   I mean, I don't even know if there's unique sort of philosophical elements there.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.100]   Anyway, can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique elements that
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:38.420]   are interesting to think about, about implementation of Marxism in the real world?
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:46.180]   - Probably the best way to get into this is to describe something that happened in Marxism
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.140]   that then shapes the answer to your question.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:57.540]   In the early days of Marx's writings, and you know, his life spans the 19th century.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:04.460]   Born in 1818, dies in 1883, so literally he lives the 19th century.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.100]   And you might, I mean, to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the first
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:18.100]   two thirds of his life as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.820]   Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:29.340]   job and partly because he was an exile in London most of his adult life, he worked in
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.340]   the library.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.980]   I mean, he had a lot of time.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:38.060]   He got subsidized a little bit by Engels, whose family were manufacturers.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:47.220]   And you might say the first half to two thirds of his life are about the critique of capitalism.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:54.860]   And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his work, Western Europe more or less,
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.860]   was interested in.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.740]   That's what they wanted.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.900]   And he gave that to them.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:04.860]   He wasn't the only one, but he was very, very effective at it.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:15.460]   By the last third of his life, he and the other producers of an anti-capitalist movement,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:22.460]   like the Chartists in England, that's a whole other movement, the anarchists of various
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:30.660]   kinds like Proudhon in France or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.220]   You put all these together and there was a shift in what the audience, let's call it
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:45.620]   a mixture of militant working class people on the one hand and critical or radical intelligentsia
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.940]   on the other.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.280]   They now wanted a different question.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.380]   They were persuaded by the analysis.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:59.140]   They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would like to do better than.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.260]   And the question became, how do we do this?
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.100]   Not anymore, should we, why should we, could we maybe fix capitalism?
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.620]   No, they had gotten to the point the system has to be fundamentally changed.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.880]   But they didn't go, you might imagine, they didn't go and say, well, what will that new
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.720]   system look like?
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.820]   They didn't go that way.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:26.040]   What they did was ask the question, how could we get beyond capitalism?
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.700]   It seems so powerful.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:34.660]   It seems to have captured people's minds, people's daily lives, and so on.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:40.620]   And the focus of the conversation became, this was already by the last third of the
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:48.240]   19th century, the question of the agency, the mechanism whereby we would get beyond.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:56.140]   And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused on seizing the government.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.820]   See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a major interest.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:07.080]   If you read Marx's Capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes, there's almost
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.500]   nothing in the state.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:14.840]   I mean, he mentions it, but he's interested in the details of how capitalism works, factory
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.020]   by factory, store by store, office.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.620]   What's the structure?
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.460]   The government's secondary for him.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.620]   But there's also humans within that capitalist system of, there's the working class.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.540]   It's about the class struggle.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.860]   That's what he's interested in.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.700]   Think of it almost mechanically like the workplace.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.020]   In the workplace there, some people who do this and other people who do that, and they
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:45.140]   accept this division of authority, and they accept this division of what's going on here,
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of capitalism was
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:57.140]   to maximize something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the workings
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.940]   of the enterprise.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.860]   The government was not the key factor here.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.900]   And he was looking at ideas of value.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:11.500]   How much value does the labor of the individual workers provide?
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.060]   And that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way?
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.660]   So those are the questions of-
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660]   Right.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.660]   We'll get to that.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.660]   Yeah, okay.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.420]   But the government is not part of that picture.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.600]   So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:36.740]   when this begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate among Marxists
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.580]   about the role of the state.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.620]   They all agree, nearly all of them agree, that you have to get the state.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:53.500]   The working class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.820]   of capitalism.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:01.180]   When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police, or he calls the army, or
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.180]   both of them.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:11.340]   And so the government is in a sense this key institution captured in Marxist language by
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:19.500]   the bourgeoisie, by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of suffrage.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:26.780]   If suffrage is universal, or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way capitalism
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:33.860]   brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French-American revolution is to create
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.060]   a place where elected representatives-
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:45.100]   So the government being subject to suffrage creates the notion, "Aha, here's how we're
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.020]   going to- we have to seize the state."
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:53.660]   And then that gets agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.120]   One side says, "You go with the election.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.220]   You mobilize the voter."
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.260]   That gets to be called reformism within Marxism.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.780]   And the other side is revolution.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.980]   Don't do that.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.140]   This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.980]   You can't get there.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.480]   They've long ago learned how to manipulate parliaments.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.940]   They buy the politicians and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be the way
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.780]   to do it.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.540]   Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.300]   They did it that way.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:36.940]   They didn't do- I mean, they fought in the Duma, in the parliament, but they didn't.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:46.300]   And this focus on the state, I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time-
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:52.140]   and if you're interested in the great names, there was a great theorist of the role of
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:59.140]   the state in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.560]   Very important.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:07.940]   His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge figures
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.020]   in Marxism at the time.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.620]   And they wrote the articles that everybody reads, but it was a much broader debate.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.500]   By the way, that debate still goes on.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.860]   Reformism versus revolution?
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.420]   In terms not all that different.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.420]   I mean, it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:34.300]   Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress, reformation
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   versus revolution?
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.100]   I'd rather tell you the historical story.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.180]   Over and over and over again, in most cases, the reformists have always won because revolution
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.940]   is frightening, is scary, is dangerous.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.540]   And so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant discussion,
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:26:00.020]   not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.020]   won.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.300]   I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:11.860]   In the Great Depression of the 1930s, you had an extraordinary shift to the left in
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:17.400]   the United States, the greatest shift to the left in the country's history before or since.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.140]   Nothing like it.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:28.220]   Suddenly you created a vast left wing composed of the labor movement, which went crazy in
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.220]   the 1930s.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.420]   We organized more people into unions in the 1930s than at any time before or any time
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   since.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.900]   It is the explosion.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.740]   And at the same time, the explosion of two socialist parties and the Communist Party
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:49.660]   that became very powerful, and they all worked together, creating a very powerful leftist
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.900]   presence in this country.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.260]   They debated in a strategically real way, reform or revolution.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:04.020]   The reformers were the union people, by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.980]   by and large, because they were affiliated with the Communist International, with Russia
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.100]   and all of that.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.940]   And in between, you might say, the two socialist parties, one that was Trotskyist in inspiration
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.460]   and the other one more moderate Western European kind of socialism.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.780]   And they had this intense debate.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.460]   And they ended up, the reformists won that debate.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:34.760]   There was no revolution in the 1930s here, but there was a reform that achieved unspeakably
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:40.700]   great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does, because
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:48.060]   it achieved in a few years in the 1930s, starting around 1932-33, social security in this country.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.900]   We had never had that before.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.500]   It's the same one we have now.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.020]   Unemployment insurance never existed before, but you have it still today.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.540]   Minimum wage for the first time, still have that today.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.620]   And a federal program of employment that hired 15 million people.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.380]   These were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.380]   So that's the '30s and the '40s.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.980]   '30s, not much in the '40s anymore, but in the '30s.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.260]   And here's the best part.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.940]   It was paid for by taxes on corporations and the rich.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.380]   So when people today say, "Well, you can tax the corporate."
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:32.140]   The joke is I have to teach American history to Americans, because it has been erased from
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.140]   consciousness.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.300]   We'll return to that, but first let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.300]   century with the Russians.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.580]   Right, with the Russians.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:47.520]   So their interpretation goes like this.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   Everybody was right.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.420]   The state is crucial.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   We were right.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.820]   We were the revolutionaries.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.260]   We seized the state here in Russia.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:03.740]   Now we have the state, and socialism is when the working class captures the state, either
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:10.040]   by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state to make the transition
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:16.060]   from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.500]   And again, make a long story short in the interest of time.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:27.380]   What happens, which is not unusual in human history, is that the means becomes the end.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.700]   In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he died.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700]   He doesn't live very long.
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:37.500]   He dies at 23, so he's only in power from 17, he's dated 22.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   By that time he has his brain trouble.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.100]   1923, by the way, not at age 23.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.100]   People are listening.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   1923.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.100]   Yeah, he's only there for four or five years.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.100]   He's very clear.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.580]   He even says, I've done work on that.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.060]   I've published, so I know this stuff.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.220]   He says in a famous speech, "Let's not fool ourselves.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   We have captured the state, but we don't have socialism.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.340]   We have to create that.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.180]   We have to move towards that."
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.940]   With Stalin, Lenin dies, and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.300]   Trotsky loses the fight.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   He's exiled.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.780]   He goes to Mexico.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.620]   Stalin is now alone in power.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.900]   He does all the things he's famous or infamous for.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.700]   By the end of the '20s, Stalin makes a decision.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:33.100]   I mean, not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.260]   following.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.780]   They declare that they are socialism.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:47.100]   In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the state capture
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.220]   has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other things.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.220]   No, no.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.900]   The state itself, once you have it, is socialism.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.300]   When a socialist captures the state, that's socialism.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   Exactly.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   That's exactly right.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   I feel like that's definitionally confusing.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.220]   Well, it shouldn't be because I gave you an example.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:16.460]   If you go to many parts of the United States today and you ask people, "What's socialism?"
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.460]   They'll tell you.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.580]   They'll look you right in the face and they'll say, "The post office."
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.940]   When I first heard this as a young man, "What?
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.440]   The post office?"
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.700]   It took me a while to understand.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:36.500]   The post office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States where the
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.540]   government runs something.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.180]   This is socialism.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.060]   Only capitalism is if the government doesn't run it.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:52.740]   If a private individual who's not a government official runs it, well, then it's capitalism.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.620]   If the government takes it, then it's socialism.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.420]   What is wrong with that reasoning?
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.780]   The idea, I think-
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.580]   There's nothing wrong with it's a way of looking at the world.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.220]   It's just got nothing to do with Marx.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   Well, there's Marx.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   There's Marxism.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.860]   Let's try to pull this apart.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:20.820]   What role does central planning have in Marxism?
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:29.700]   Marxism is concerned with this class struggle, with respecting the working class.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.820]   What is the connection between that struggle and central planning that is often ... Central
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.860]   planning is often associated with Marxism.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.140]   So a centralized power doing-
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.140]   Russia did that.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.140]   Allocation.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:49.340]   So that has to do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.340]   Union.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.340]   Has nothing to do with Marx.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.340]   How else can you do-
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:58.940]   I don't think you can find anywhere in Marx's writing anything about central planning or
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.820]   any other kind of planning.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:10.900]   Again, fundamentally then, Marx's work has to do with factories, with workers, with the
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:17.540]   bourgeoisie, and the exploitation of the working class.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.820]   You still have to take that leap.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.860]   What is beyond capitalism?
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.860]   Right.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.260]   Maybe we should turn to that, focus on that.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260]   Okay.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.260]   Yes.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   Okay, we've already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.900]   How else can we go beyond capitalism?
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.500]   Let me push it a little further.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.860]   They didn't succeed, in my judgment, as a Marxist.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:47.060]   And I'm now going to tell you why they didn't succeed, because they didn't understand as
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.620]   well as they could have or should have, what Marxists was trying to do.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.940]   I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circumstances.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:00.220]   This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding what's going
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   on.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.220]   All right.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.020]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.100]   Most of my adult life, I have taught Marxian economics.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.780]   I'm a professor of economics.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.020]   I've been that all my life.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.780]   I'm a graduate of American universities.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:22.980]   As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universities.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.140]   That's another conversation you and I can have.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.740]   So I went to Harvard, then I went to Stanford, and I finished at Yale.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:35.180]   I'm like a poster boy for elite education.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.020]   They tried very hard.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.820]   By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.140]   20 semesters, one after the other, no break.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:52.620]   In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word about Marxism.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:58.140]   That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me, ever, with one except.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:04.820]   One professor in Stanford, in the one semester I studied with him, he gave me plenty to read,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.300]   but nobody else.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.060]   So that's really interesting.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.280]   You've mentioned that in the past, and that's very true, which makes you a very interesting
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:22.180]   figure to hold your ground intellectually through this idea space where just people
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.740]   don't really even talk about it.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.620]   Perhaps we can discuss historically why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:36.260]   So Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of--
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.700]   - Dismissal.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.940]   The best example, yeah, he came up only as an object of dismissal.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:47.580]   For you to give an example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:53.580]   was for many years the canonical book, it isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:36:00.340]   a professor of economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson, and people, a whole generation
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.380]   or two were trained on his textbook.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:10.540]   If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree, and the tree is Adam Smith and
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:15.340]   David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of it.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.140]   He's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing developed.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.820]   It's a tree, and everybody on it is a bourgeois.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.380]   And then there's this one little branch that goes off like this and sort of starts heading
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.460]   back down, that's Karl Marx.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.820]   In other words, he had to have it complete, 'cause he's not a complete faker, but beyond
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.100]   that, no, there was no.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:44.180]   Nothing in the book gives you two paragraphs of an approach.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.180]   But that's Cold War.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.460]   I mean, that's really neither here nor there.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.460]   That's the craziness.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.580]   Yeah, that's the Cold War in this country.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.820]   My professors were afraid.
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.300]   Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:04.660]   Marx was interested in the relationship of people in the process of production.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.420]   He's interested in the factory, the office, the store.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:14.500]   What goes on, and by that he means, what are the relationships among the people that come
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.580]   together in a workplace?
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:27.700]   And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:36.940]   understood, and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.300]   What does he mean?
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:46.140]   The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically in the following way.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:53.220]   Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the children, not the
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.740]   sick, but healthy adults, in the following way.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.300]   A big block of them, a clear majority, work.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.340]   That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:12.020]   A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:17.740]   In every human community, Marx argues, there are the people who do that work, but they
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:25.980]   always produce more chairs, more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.980]   Whatever their standard of living.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:33.060]   Doesn't have to be low, could be medium, could be high, but they always produce more than
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.660]   they themselves consume.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:41.940]   That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German word mehr, M-E-H-R,
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.740]   which is the English equivalent of more.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.580]   It's the more.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.300]   That more got badly translated into the word surplus.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.660]   Shouldn't have been, but it was.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.780]   By the way, by German and English people doing the translations.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.460]   What's the difference between more and surplus?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.820]   Is there a nuanced...
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:08.500]   Yeah, because surplus has a notion of it's discretionary, it's sort of extra.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.100]   He's not making a judgment that it's extra.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.580]   It's a simple math equation.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.020]   Yes, very simple.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.020]   One minus the other.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.020]   Literally.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   Yes.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.020]   X minus Y.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.020]   Reduce versus...
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.020]   That's right.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.380]   X is the total output, Y is the consumption by the producer, therefore X minus Y equals
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.500]   S, the surplus.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.820]   Exactly.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:37.180]   Now Marx argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question,
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.940]   who gets the surplus?
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:46.700]   Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it?
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:52.820]   And Marx's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.220]   How is that organized?
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.340]   For example, who gets it?
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:03.460]   What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting it?
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.300]   What's their social role?
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.940]   For example, here we go now.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:14.660]   If you get this and you get the core of it anyway, and I don't charge much, the workers
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.660]   themselves could get it.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.220]   At least less than lawyers.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.220]   That's right.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.580]   The workers themselves could get it.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.300]   That's the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:34.420]   Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus together decide what to do with
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.420]   it.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:40.620]   So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more importantly, who gets to decide who
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620]   gets it.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.340]   Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with it.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.660]   Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:54.060]   So that's the logic of the word sequence.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:01.100]   It's produced, Marx uses the word appropriated, in other words, who's property, who gets to
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.540]   decide, if you like, what happens.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.340]   All that property ever meant is who gets to decide and who's excluded.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.620]   That's a clean definition of communism for him.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.620]   Right.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.460]   And that's the, by the way, it's not just clean.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.060]   It's the only one.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   So what's, can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   Yes.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.060]   Easy.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]   It becomes very easy now.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:29.860]   Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.500]   people other than those who produced it.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.900]   Slaves produce a surplus, which the master gets.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.660]   Serfs produce a surplus, which the Lord gets.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.580]   Employees produce a surplus, which the employer gets.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.980]   It's very simple.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:57.740]   These are exploitative class structures because one class produces a surplus, appropriated,
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:04.980]   distributed by another group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility,
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:12.460]   enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.580]   class struggle.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.460]   I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.900]   You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.900]   here.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.340]   It's a nice day, and the children are playing, and in comes one of those men with an ice
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.260]   cream truck comes by.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.420]   Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, your children see the ice cream.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.500]   "Daddy, get me an ice cream."
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:40.180]   So you walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones, and you give
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.580]   them to one of the children.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.860]   The other one begins to scream and yell, "And how?"
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.940]   "Obviously, what's the issue?"
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:54.500]   And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake, so you order the one you gave the
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   two ice cream cones to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:06.180]   is, and that's how you solve the problem, until a psychologist comes along and says,
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.580]   "You know, you didn't fix it by what you just did.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.660]   You should never have done that in the first place."
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:22.820]   My response, though, you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:28.540]   political, cultural, these are all giving the ice cream cone back to the kid, "You
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.780]   should never do this in the first place."
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.500]   The reallocation of resources creates bitterness in the populace.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:39.740]   Look at our ... This country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.660]   in my life, and I've lived here all my life, and I've worked here all my life.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:50.860]   It's tearing itself apart, and it's tearing itself apart basically over the re-division,
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:57.140]   the redistribution of wealth, having so badly distributed in the first ... But that's all
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:04.180]   in marks, and notice as I explain to you what is going on in this tension-filled production
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.260]   scene in the office, the factory, the store, I don't have to say a word about the government.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.900]   I'm not interested in the government.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:16.740]   The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question, and here comes the
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.660]   big point.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:27.340]   If you make a revolution, and all you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:34.220]   a government official without changing the relationship, you can call yourself a Marxist
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.960]   all day long, but you're not getting the point of the Marxism.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:43.580]   The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.900]   You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:54.220]   all the decisions and gets the surplus vis-a-vis another one that produces it.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:59.100]   If you do that, you will destroy the whole project.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:04.540]   Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get, but you'll so misunderstand it
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.420]   that you, the Germans again have a phrase, "Es geht schief."
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.460]   It goes crooked.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.500]   It doesn't go right.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:17.820]   The project gets off the rails because it can't understand either what its objective
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.920]   should have been, and therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's missing its objective.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.100]   It just knows that this is not what it had hoped for.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.420]   I mean, there's a lot of fascinating questions here.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:40.620]   So one is, to what degree, so there's human nature, to what degree does communism, a lack
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.420]   of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge?
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:49.820]   If you leave two people together in a room and come back a year later, if you leave five
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:55.920]   people together in a room, if you leave 100 people and 1,000 people, it seems that humans
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.980]   form hierarchies naturally.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:06.620]   So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you define
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:16.180]   that, starts becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non-negative sense,
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:22.500]   a more generic sense, starts to become an employer, not in a capitalist sense, but just
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.500]   as a human.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.720]   So you go do this, and in exchange I will give you this.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.360]   Just becomes the leadership role.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:35.000]   So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice, the idea sort of of communism would
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   be nice to not steal from the world.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   - It's nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice 'cause of human nature.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   - Because of human nature.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.080]   That's, thank you.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:50.920]   So what can we say about leveraging human nature to achieve some of these ends?
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.600]   There's so many ways of responding, in no particular order.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.040]   Here are some of them.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:07.360]   The history of the human race, as best I can tell, is a history in which a succession of
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:19.200]   social forms, forms of society, arise, and as they do, they rule out some kinds of human
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.720]   behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive and unacceptable.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:33.160]   The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct, is there some human nature
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.520]   that makes people want to do this?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.840]   Well whatever that is, this has to be repressed or else we don't have a society.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:47.080]   And Freud helps us to understand that that repression is going on all the time, and it
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.720]   has consequences.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.320]   It's not a finished project, you repress it.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   It's gone.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.680]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:00.200]   So for example, when you get a bunch of people together at some point, they may develop animosities
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   towards one another that lead them to want the other person or persons to disappear,
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.600]   to be dead, to be gone.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.520]   But we don't permit you to do that.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.320]   We just don't.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:23.720]   Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it on the grounds
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:30.760]   that it is the only system consistent with human nature, and that every effort to go
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.960]   beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:43.480]   I can show you endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.880]   community that has ever been studied, slavery, wherever it's existed.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:53.000]   I can show you endless documents in which the defenders of those systems, not all of
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.880]   them of course, but many defenders used that argument.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:05.120]   To naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going, to counter
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:12.520]   the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:18.960]   And therefore capitalism, since it was born, and since it's been developing, we all know
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.720]   what the next stage of capitalism is.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   - What can infer?
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.120]   If what you're saying- - The burden is on the people who think
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   it isn't gonna die.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   - Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.480]   you're deeply suspicious of the argument, this is going against human nature 'cause
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.760]   we keep using that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.640]   destructive systems.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:48.240]   That said, well let me just ask a million different questions.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:58.320]   So one, what about the argument that sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk?
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.720]   So the, yeah, versus the employee who's just there doing the labor.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.520]   The capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:13.560]   Are they not, in sort of aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort,
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:19.120]   hiring a lot of people, aren't they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure?
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.560]   - So first of all, there's risk.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.240]   Almost in everything you undertake, any project that begins now and ends in the future, it
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.200]   takes a risk that between now and that future, something's gonna happen that makes it not
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   work out.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:40.480]   I mean, I got into a cab before I came here today in order to do this with you.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   I took a risk.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.880]   The cab could have been in an accident, the lightning could have hit us, a bear could
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.200]   have eaten my left foot.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   Who the hell knows?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.520]   - But shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took?
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.800]   - No, hold it a second.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.720]   Let's do this step by step.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.400]   So everybody's taking a risk.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.280]   I always found it wonderful you talk about risk and then you imagine it's only some of
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.720]   us who take a risk.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.680]   Let's go with the worker, with the capitalist.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:15.000]   That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to take that job.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.720]   He made a decision to have children.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.560]   They are teenagers, they're now in school at a time when their friendships are crucial
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   to their development.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.940]   You're gonna yank them out of the school because his job is gone?
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:36.640]   He took an enormous risk to do that job every day, to forestall all the other things he
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.140]   could have done.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:44.120]   He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next month, next year.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:49.680]   He bought a house, which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he's now stuck.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.560]   He has to make a monthly payment.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:58.840]   If you make a mistake, you capitalist, he's the one who's gonna, you're a capitalist,
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.640]   you got a lot of money, otherwise you wouldn't be in that position.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   You've got a cushion, he doesn't.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.520]   If you investigate, you'll see that in every business I've ever been in, and I've been
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.520]   involved in a lot of them.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.040]   So you think it's possible to actually measure risk or is your basic argument is there's
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.120]   risk involved in a lot of both the working class and the bourgeoisie, the capitalists?
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   That's right.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:27.040]   The worker would never come and say, "Because he's been taught right.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   I want this payment, a wage, for the work I do.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.440]   And I want this payment for the risk I take."
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.400]   But there's some level of communication like that.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.840]   You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary,
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.620]   all those kinds of things.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:50.880]   But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.160]   You don't believe that.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:58.480]   This country is now being literally transformed from below by an army of workers who work
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.860]   at Amazon, fast food joints.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.760]   You know what their complaint is?
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.960]   It's killing us.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.540]   We get paid shit and it's killing us.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:15.400]   There is no relationship, except in the minds of the defenders of capitalism, between the
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:20.920]   ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one hand and the wage.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.240]   Let me give you just a couple of examples.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.560]   This is my job.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.120]   This is my life, what I do.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:34.400]   The median income of a childcare worker in the United States right now, as we speak,
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.600]   is $11.22 an hour, median.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.440]   So 50% make less, 50% make more.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:51.120]   The median income for a car park attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.320]   What does the car park attendant do?
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:54:00.520]   He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.680]   Maybe he parks it and he moves it around to get it in and out.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:12.200]   By any measure that I know of that makes any rational sense, being in charge of toddlers,
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:18.040]   two, three, four-year-olds who are at the key moment of mental formation the first five
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:25.280]   years, to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who watches your car.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   Come on.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.720]   I know how to explain it.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.200]   Gender explained, all kinds of issues.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:36.160]   The car park people are males and the childcare people are females.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:42.400]   That in our culture is a very big marker of what ... But the one who said, only the economics
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:47.120]   professor, nobody else, says this stuff.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.600]   Because in economics, I don't know if you are familiar with our profession, but we have
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.120]   something which we call marginal product.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.920]   This is a fantasy.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.160]   I was a mathematician before I became an economist.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.520]   I loved mathematics.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.000]   I specialized in mathematics.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.680]   I know mathematics pretty well.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:11.520]   What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it's mathematics.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.880]   It's very sophisticated.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.120]   It isn't.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:24.000]   But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal product
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   of a factor of production, like a worker.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.320]   In the textbook, when it's taught, I've taught this stuff.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.120]   I hold my nose, but I teach it.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.800]   Then I explain to students, what I've just taught you is horse shit, but first I teach
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   it.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.480]   What is the marginal product, if it might be useful to say?
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:45.360]   The notion is, if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.200]   diminution of the output?
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.080]   That's the marginal product of that worker.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.800]   Measured by ... The amount of the output that diminishes
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.520]   the output of the raw product, of the product.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.120]   Usually in real terms, so physical, not the value.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.920]   You could do a value, but it's really more the physical you're at.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.560]   There is a transformation thing.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.880]   I'd love to talk to you about value.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.240]   It's so interesting, what is value.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.640]   I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that, but I just want to
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.880]   get to the ... Hegel, who was Marx's teacher, has a famous line.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.160]   You can't step in the same river twice.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.920]   The argument is, you and the river have changed between the first and the second time.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.760]   It's a different you and it's a different river.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.600]   You can choose not to pay attention to that.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.680]   You can't claim you're not doing that.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.320]   You can't claim that you can actually do that, because you can't.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.800]   There is no way to do that.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:51.260]   The meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.760]   of the effect that it has on the output.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   That's right.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.680]   Too many other things are going on.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.600]   Too many things are changing.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:05.520]   You cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome on the output side is uniquely
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.240]   determined by the change you made on the input side.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.480]   You can't do that.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.240]   Even in the average, it's not going to work out.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   You can take ... Look, mathematics is full of abstractions.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:22.520]   You can say, as we do in economics, "Ceteris paribus."
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.400]   Everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.360]   You held everything ... You know why you do that?
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.440]   Because you can't do that in the real world.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.560]   That's not possible.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.320]   You better account for that.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:39.560]   Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality you abstracted from
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.160]   to get the abstraction.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.600]   As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.360]   of removing every single economist from the world, would we be better off or worse off?
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   Much better off.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.360]   Okay.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.000]   Economics is ... And I'm one.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   I'm talking about myself.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   See economics ...
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.120]   We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how it all works out.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:12.400]   But the serious part of this is that economics ... It's really about capitalism.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.320]   Economics as a discipline is born with capital.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   There was no such thing.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:22.240]   When I teach, I teach courses at the university, for example, called History of Economic Thought.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.720]   And I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.840]   And I say, "You know, they talked about really interesting things, but they never called
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.840]   it economics."
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:38.360]   There was no ... It made no sense to people to abstract something as central to daily
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.400]   life as economics broadly defined.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.580]   It made no sense.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.560]   That's a creation much, much later.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:48.640]   That's capitalism that did that, created the field.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.440]   So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.880]   By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.360]   Plato and Aristotle talked about markets, because they lived at a time in ancient Greece
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:09.540]   when market relations were beginning to intrude upon these societies.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:15.120]   So they were both interested in this phenomena, that we're not just producing goods and then
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.760]   distributing among us, we're doing it in a quid pro quo.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.720]   I'll give you three oranges, you give me two shirts, a market exchange.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:30.140]   And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.120]   They destroy social cohesion.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.840]   They destroy community.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:39.680]   They make some people rich and other people poor, and they set us against each other,
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.960]   and it's terrible.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.700]   And here's what ... They agreed on that.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.560]   Here's what they disagreed on.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:49.880]   One of them said, "Okay, there can be no markets."
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   That was Plato.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.520]   Aristotle comes back and says, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.080]   Too late for that.
[00:59:55.080 --> 01:00:00.840]   The disruption caused in society by getting rid of this institution that has crawled in
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.520]   amongst us would be too devastating.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.080]   So we can't do that.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.760]   But what we can do is control it, regulate it.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.800]   Get from the market what it does reasonably well, and prevent it from doing the destructive
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.720]   things it does so badly."
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.000]   So the fundamentally destructive thing of a market is it's the engine of capitalism,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.840]   so it creates exploitation of the worker.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.600]   It facilitates ... I wouldn't ... That's too ...
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   Facilitates.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.440]   It facilitates it, and it is an institution that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.320]   danger to community.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   Is there ...
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   Is there a way?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.240]   Is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:54.200]   Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.480]   This was that God said, "If there's a person who needs to borrow from you, then that's
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:08.640]   a person in need, and the good Christian thing to do is to help him, to demand an interest
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:15.320]   payment rather than to help your fellow man, is God hates you for that.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.600]   That's a sin.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.680]   Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes."
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.200]   But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system?
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.840]   So that has to do with the intimate human interaction.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.520]   The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves thousands, millions
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:47.000]   of humans, and there'd be some level of safe, self-regulating fairness.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.240]   There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   I wonder what ...
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   So, I guess ...
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   Suppose you were interested in having ... Suppose you took us your problem.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.360]   We have a set of funds that can be loaned out.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.920]   People don't want to consume it.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.000]   They're ready to lend it.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.520]   Okay.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.480]   To whom should they lend it?
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:18.340]   Well, we could say in our society, "We're going to run this the way professors in institutions
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.400]   like MIT work this.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.440]   They write up a project.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.720]   They send the project in to some government office where it is looked at against other
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.840]   governments, and this office in the government decides, 'We're going to fund this one and
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.120]   that one because they're more needed in our society.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:44.760]   We're in greater need of solving this problem than that problem, and so we're going to lend
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.400]   money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.200]   because we're going to ... " But instead, what we do is, who can pay the highest interest
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   rate?
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200]   Whoa.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.000]   What are you doing?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   Why?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.480]   What ethics would justify you doing ... It's like a market in general.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.960]   Something is in shortage.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.920]   All markets are about how to handle shortage.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.080]   It's one basic way to understand it.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.440]   And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage means, has
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.360]   no other meaning, if the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got a problem.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:28.440]   You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   You have a shortage.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.480]   Okay, now how are you going to do it?
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.600]   In a market, you allow people who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever's
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.120]   short.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.000]   That solves your problem because as the price goes up, the poor people can't ... They drop
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   out.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.600]   They can't buy the thing at the exalted price.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.280]   So you've got a way of distributing the shortage.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.200]   It goes to the people with the most money.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:00.040]   At this point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:08.040]   against it because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say, "What?"
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040]   You know what that means?
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.800]   It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat while the poor
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.400]   person has no milk for their five children.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.200]   There it is.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.200]   You want a market?
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200]   Why?
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:27.200]   Because the fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality now.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.480]   Or death.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480]   Or death.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   Well, that's the ultimate inequality.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.440]   Yes, it is.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.520]   What about ... And we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:42.280]   to the debate type of thing.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.240]   What about the lifting ties, raise all boats?
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:54.680]   If we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this, but they attribute
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:02.960]   a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life to capitalism.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:11.280]   To inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments that resulted from
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.520]   competition and all those kinds of forces.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:22.760]   So not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined,
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.240]   but just observing historically.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.500]   Look at the 20th century.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:33.320]   We came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life easier and better on average.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.200]   What do you say to that?
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.040]   I have several responses to that.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.680]   I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's going on there.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.000]   But let me give you the arguments so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.600]   them, as can anybody who's listening or watching.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's central arguments was that everything that
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.840]   exists exists "in contradiction."
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.080]   In simple English, there's a good and bad side, if you like, to everything.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.040]   And you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.760]   good things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.160]   side of the good ones, et cetera.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.520]   So- The dialectic.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.600]   Yes, exactly.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:32.800]   And Marx, very attentive to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions and applies
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.520]   it, of course, to the central object of his research, capitalism.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:44.160]   So this is not a simple-minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.720]   as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:56.400]   And one of the things he celebrates a lot is the technological dynamism of the system,
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.000]   which Marx takes to be profound, because he lived at the time when major breakthroughs
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:11.080]   in textile technology and mining and chemistry and so on were achieved.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:19.640]   But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible for the improvement in the quality
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:25.560]   or the standard of living of the mass of people, Marx now comes back and says, "Oh, wait a
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.640]   minute here.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:37.720]   Number one, capitalism as a system has been mostly represented by capitalists," which
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.320]   makes a certain sense.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   And those capitalists, with very few exceptions, some, but very few, have fought against every
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.240]   effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.180]   The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:03.360]   What that means is replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:10.140]   U.S. to cheap China, bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world because they
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:14.660]   will work for less money than the folks that you have here at home.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:20.480]   Every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for for
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:27.860]   decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning to right now.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:33.000]   The reason we have a minimum wage, which was passed in the middle of the 1930s, when it
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.080]   was proposed it was blocked by capitalists.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.080]   They got together.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.160]   They don't want—and today, just a factoid for you.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.240]   The last time the minimum wage was raised in the United States, federal minimum wage,
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:58.880]   was in 2009 when it was set at the lofty sum of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:06.120]   Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is now, 11, 12, 13 years since then, we have
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.080]   had an increase in the price level in this country every year.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.240]   And in the last year, 8.5%.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:19.840]   During that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.220]   What?
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.520]   This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:37.440]   This is a—you know, the nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get credit
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.520]   for the improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every generation.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.920]   You know, it takes your breath away.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.040]   It's an argument.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.240]   Whoa.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.320]   But I take my hat off if I had one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.040]   system.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.320]   Long ago—let me get to the heart of it.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:08.760]   Long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease, could have—I
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.880]   mean, way beyond what we have now.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.360]   But it didn't.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.240]   And that's the worst moral condemnation imaginable.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.600]   How do you justify that when you could, you didn't?
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:30.640]   Look, let me get at it another way, because this may interest you anyway.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.680]   The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   It is.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.120]   And along the way, it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.440]   No question.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:50.480]   But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:59.520]   into capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous—and I can give you, because
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.080]   you do math, you'll understand it.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.280]   Think of it this way.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:11.400]   Imagine a production process in which you have $100 that the capitalist has to lay out
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:17.600]   for tools, equipment, and raw materials, and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.280]   the workers, and he puts them all together, and he has an output.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:30.320]   And let's say the output is 100 units of something, and what are the prices, and that's his revenue.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.920]   And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue, let's say the revenue
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:42.640]   is—it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   220, sorry.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.920]   And he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up, another
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.840]   100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit, and he puts
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.400]   that aside.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.160]   Now along comes a technological breakthrough.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   A machine.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.880]   A new machine.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:11.320]   And the new machine is so effective, you can get the same number of units of output with
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   half the workers.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.800]   So you don't need to spend 100 on workers, you only need to spend 50.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.200]   You can do it with half the workers.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.460]   And so the capitalist goes to the workers—by the way, this happens every day—and he says
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.120]   to half of them, "You're fired.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.640]   Don't come back Monday morning.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   I don't need you."
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.920]   It's nothing personal, it's just, "I got a machine."
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.460]   Why does he do that?
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.760]   Because the 50 he now no longer has to spend on labor, because he doesn't need half of
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.860]   them, he keeps.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.860]   Everything else is the same.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:46.640]   The machine, everything else is just to make the math easy.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:54.560]   So he keeps as his own profit the 50 that before he paid for those workers.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.000]   Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 he doesn't have to give to the next job because
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   he has a new machine.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.480]   So that's what he does.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.120]   The technology leads.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.880]   He's happy.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.000]   He's become more profitable.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.680]   He's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the machine.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.840]   The workers are screwed.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.080]   Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and wife, tell them
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.480]   I don't have a job anymore.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.360]   I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.880]   The guy was nice enough to say there was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need me.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.440]   So I'm completely screwed here.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.840]   I don't know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.360]   education or whatever else he's got going for himself.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.500]   Now the point.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.840]   There was of course an alternative path.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.360]   The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers, pay them exactly the same
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.520]   that you did before for half a day's work.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:01.240]   You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:06.800]   But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.400]   the lives of these workers.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:17.160]   The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:23.120]   But instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.800]   of more money.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.840]   You want to support a system like this?
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.640]   Well, to go back to Hegel.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   Yes.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   You listed the bad.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   Yes.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.480]   So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.080]   of this kind of system.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.880]   The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to ideas of what the
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.140]   alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative?
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:56.480]   So you just kind of as a opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:04.320]   work less, get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other--
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.320]   Interests.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:14.160]   Other interests, the creative interest, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.960]   and embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:31.120]   Yes, but then what cost does that have on the deadline-fueled, competition-fueled machine
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.520]   of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   Slows it down.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   It slows it down.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:44.840]   And the question is which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840]   I agree with that.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.360]   And I'd love there to be a democratic mechanism.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:56.520]   So let's discuss it, let's debate it, and then let's decide what mixture, because it's
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.600]   not either or.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.140]   The math problem I gave you is either or.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140]   We could mix it.
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.800]   You could have a third less of a working day instead of a half less, and then the other
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.080]   part would be extra profit for our employer, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:16.400]   So let's have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive and-- we have
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.840]   no such thing.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.340]   All of this is decided by one side in this debate, which not only we know what they do,
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.240]   they always choose the one that maximizes their profit, because that's what they were
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.240]   told to do in business school where I've taught.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.320]   So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided to boot.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:42.240]   So we don't have the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists and
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:48.560]   say let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.680]   We'll make mistakes, but we'll all make them together.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.760]   It won't be one of us making a dictatorial decision.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.800]   You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat, not as a
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:05.220]   notion of how government-- it's not, I'm sorry, not Marx, Lenin did that-- not as a notion
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:10.800]   of how the government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.200]   The dictatorship of these key decisions is not made by some sitting council, it's made
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   by each little capitalist in his/her relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.480]   why Marx focused his analysis on that point.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.000]   And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't lurk in the background what
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.560]   the alternative is.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   Let's go there.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560]   Okay.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.640]   So let's go right back to what I said earlier.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:44.720]   The workers themselves, the collection of employees together appropriate their own surplus
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:52.200]   and decide democratically what to do with it, which includes the decision of whether
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:18:00.700]   or not to buy a machine and whether or not to use the machine and the savings it might
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:12.040]   allow to be handled by more leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments in technology
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.800]   or new products or whatever they want.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.160]   And you know, this is an old idea in human-- Marx loved that.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.520]   Toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.960]   And one of the reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.200]   that in this society and that one, including here in the United States, that there were
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:47.920]   examples of people who organized their production in precisely this way, as a collective democratic
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.080]   community in which everybody had an equal voice.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:58.400]   So we all together decide democratically what to produce, how to produce, where to produce,
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.080]   and what to do with the output we all help to produce.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:11.880]   So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy is a value nearly everybody
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.320]   subscribes to.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.660]   Think about it this way.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:22.100]   The stunning contradiction that there is a place in our society where democracy has never
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.000]   been allowed to enter.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.080]   The workplace.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:33.160]   In the workplace, a tiny group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them, the employer,
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.520]   whether that's an individual, a family, a partnership, or a corporate board of directors,
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:45.240]   tiny group of people, controls economically a vast mass of employees.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.000]   Those employees don't elect those people, have no, nothing, there is no accountability.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.200]   It is the most undemocratic arrangement imaginable, and this society insists on calling itself
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:06.080]   democratic when it has organized the minor matter of producing everything in a way that
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   is the direct, it's autocratic.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:15.600]   - So to push back on a few things, so one is the idea of this society calling itself
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.000]   democratic is that the government is elected democratically, and the government is able
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.980]   to pressure the workplace through the process of regulation.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:31.360]   You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.000]   That's the one idea.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.720]   The other is there is a natural force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.520]   of competition being the accountability.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:49.440]   So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom to move
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:54.680]   to another company, work for a better boss, so that creates pressure on the employers
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:02.320]   and the bosses, that's at least the idea that you, there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:09.960]   One is the law, so regulations passed by the government, democratic, and the second is
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:15.600]   because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.440]   well 'cause you can always leave.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:25.080]   So I mean, that's kinds of accountability, but what you're saying is that does not result
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:32.360]   in a significant enough accountability where the employer, that avoids exploitation of
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   the worker.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   Absolutely.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:39.760]   I mean, whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms, and let me respond to that,
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.640]   and then I'll counter argument.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.920]   First competition.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:51.040]   Here again we have to be Hegelians just a little.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.120]   Competition destroys itself.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:59.000]   It doesn't need any, the whole point of competition is to beat the other guy.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.520]   If I can produce the same product as the other guy, either a better quality or a lower price
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:10.400]   or maybe both, then I win because the customers will come to me 'cause my price is lower or
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.360]   my quality is better, and they'll leave the other guy, he'll go out of business.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.600]   Now let's follow.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.960]   When he goes out of business, 'cause I've won the competition, he fires his workers.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.840]   I hire them because I'm now gonna be able to serve a market he can't serve anymore,
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:35.120]   so I'm gonna buy the used equipment, and thereby many become few.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.160]   Monopoly is the product of competition.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.760]   It's not the antithesis, it's the product.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.120]   Well, let's see.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.120]   That's where it comes from.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:50.560]   There's another element to the system where there's always a new guy that comes in.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.080]   There isn't, there isn't.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.080]   - Well, that's the dream.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:23:00.080]   The entrepreneurial spirit of a free, of the United States, for example, of a capitalist
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:08.000]   system is you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build up a business that
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:15.360]   takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the different car, Ford, GM, which is
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.840]   what, you look at Tesla, for example, right?
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.720]   That's the American dream.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:29.840]   One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can move from dirt poor to being the
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.240]   richest person in the world.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   - It can happen.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   - It can happen.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.240]   - You know, that's like you can win a lottery.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.400]   - No, that's not quite.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.200]   No, the lottery's complete luck.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.520]   Here you can work your ass off if you have a good idea.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.120]   - The odds are better in the lottery.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.600]   - That's not true.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.440]   There's a lot of new businesses.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.960]   - How many Teslas do you notice?
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:59.240]   - Tesla's a really bad example, 'cause the car company, the automotive sector is so difficult
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:05.760]   to, they operate at such a thin margin of profit that they're probably a good example
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:14.320]   of like capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.080]   That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.440]   - There's so much, come on.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.160]   - They have their uniquenesses, you're quite right, but so does every other industry.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.940]   The one thing that's common is that many become few.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:32.840]   What you can also have is when you have a few, they jack up the price, they make an
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   enormous profit, and in the irony of capitalism, Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.120]   people to break into this industry 'cause the few remaining are making a wild amount
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:52.120]   of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market to make it work like that for them.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:25:00.360]   The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market share, that's a polite way
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.800]   of saying they wanna become a monopolist, or to be more exact, an oligopolist, one of
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.820]   a handful of firms that dominates.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.040]   That's what they're there for.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:16.400]   - Yeah, to push back a little bit also, because that could be, this is a question also, do
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:23.000]   you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.960]   decency of human beings?
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:34.720]   So if you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the competition, but that's
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.180]   going to lead to a lot of suffering, there's a lot of people at the heads of companies
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:44.800]   that won't press that button, that it's not in the calculation, it's not just money, it's
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.080]   human well-being too.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.080]   So like-- - You think?
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.360]   - I, yes, I've-- - You and I don't live in the same place
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   then.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.800]   - So you're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top,
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.240]   and then they cease being human, essentially.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.240]   - No.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.240]   - The basic, okay.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.880]   - I wouldn't, I mean, that's why-- - Depending on your model of humans, but
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:14.440]   they lose track of the better angels of their nature, and they just become cogs in the machine,
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.680]   but they're just happen to be the cog at the top.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.240]   - I would put it differently, that the system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.320]   selection.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.160]   The guys who may, I could say the women too, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.000]   The people who make it up through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.660]   things have had to do things along the way that become selective.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:39.120]   If they can't stand it because they have that human quality, and there are people like,
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.060]   I've known them, they're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.760]   They went there and they said, "I'm not doing this anymore.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.480]   I'm not gonna treat people like that.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:54.660]   I'm gonna make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.720]   gonna be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human."
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.820]   Of course, of course.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.360]   But the system selects the firm.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:09.940]   If you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up, you're toast there anyway.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.040]   The rest of the people who vote for you are gonna kick you out.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.200]   You can tell them all day long what a lovely person you are.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.980]   Then they're gonna look at you and wonder, "Well, what happened to you?
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:22.160]   How did you even get this far with the lovely person horseshit?"
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.600]   - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.680]   It's not necessarily just lovely person.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:34.460]   So maybe, I'll just say my bias is the people I know are, especially at the top of companies,
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:42.300]   are in the tech sector, where innovation is such a big part of it.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.940]   So I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:52.260]   in the system.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:56.820]   Innovation usually comes, in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:00.620]   There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:05.980]   There's now, whatever you wanna call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:12.860]   It comes and then there's a flurry as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:15.180]   technology is.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:18.260]   You have a period where you can get excited about that.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:23.780]   And the very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly, as they always do, about
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:24.780]   innovation.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:34.380]   But again, it really is, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring kind of issue.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:41.740]   For me, how do I put this in a way that, no, I don't mean to offend.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.740]   - Please, please.
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:55.380]   - No, no, no, I don't want to, but the problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:01.380]   like this, the problem with capitalism is not that it is the one thing that's consistent
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.380]   with human nature.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:06.060]   That's what its defenders would like to have us believe.
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:13.500]   But if anything, I would argue the opposite, that it is such a contradiction to parts of
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:20.140]   our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite make it.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:25.100]   There's always gonna be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking about,
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.340]   who do quit along the way.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:34.100]   Or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top by God knows what hook or what crook
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:35.740]   that they did it.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.860]   But most of them go, and you know why?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:47.100]   Because their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:56.980]   I mean, the corporate sector this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   wage package.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.100]   They're already out of whack.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:05.520]   The average CEO pays now 300 times what the average worker pays.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.140]   But they're jacking it up even more.
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   Why?
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:10.420]   Because that's what's happening in their universe.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.020]   They're all doing it, and they have to do ... Each one of them justifies it.
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.580]   I have to do that, otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is true,
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:22.980]   but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument is very
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.460]   exciting.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:31.340]   So they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope.
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.780]   They've just gone through the COVID disaster.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:40.580]   They've gone through the second worst economic crash of capitalism in our history.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   After two years of this one-two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch, and we are
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:51.220]   now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year or early
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.220]   next year.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.060]   You can't do this to a working class.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:31:00.580]   When this was done to the German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result.
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:05.020]   You keep doing that in this country, we're already watching it, you're going to get that
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.020]   too.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.540]   You're already getting bits and pieces.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:08.540]   You can't keep doing this.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:12.380]   So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.380]   Taking out on it.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.380]   That can turn to anger.
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:20.260]   Some little 18-year-old kid who has to go three hours in his car and blow away people
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.300]   in a supermarket.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.300]   What?
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.860]   And it happens every day in this country.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.020]   Every day.
[01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:33.380]   So that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger and bigger potentially.
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:42.940]   By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality, and this goes to Elon Musk.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:49.660]   If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.220]   The number was just released yesterday.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:54.180]   49,000.
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.220]   Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:01.580]   They use up an enormous amount of energy.
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:06.660]   They use up enormous amount of resources.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:12.980]   There is a way to make transportation much more rational, and we've known it for decades.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.940]   It's called mass transportation.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:24.460]   It's a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean, frequent system of buses, trains,
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:28.780]   street trolleys, vans.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.060]   It could easily be done in this society.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:37.340]   In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:42.300]   That's less than we're sending to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.020]   A public transit system where?
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.620]   Everywhere in this country.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.940]   All the major metropolitan.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.140]   This country's overwhelmingly metropolitan area.
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.180]   Well, it surely has to be more than 30 billion, but-
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:54.020]   Well, it was a few years ago.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.340]   Sure, but you're saying it's a number that's insane.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:58.940]   Right, it's not crazy stuff.
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.940]   It's a reasonable number.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:00.940]   Right, right.
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:04.220]   Hey, listen, but there's a- Let me just finish the point.
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.540]   Sure, yes.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:10.620]   So I'm trying to be rational here.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:15.620]   If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:20.260]   fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:25.260]   fuel particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:26.820]   transit.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:30.580]   We're doing nothing to make that happen.
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580]   Nothing.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:38.020]   Well, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.500]   to be reusable vehicles.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.380]   It will end, in theory, car ownership.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:46.740]   So you just have a more kind of distributed public transit system.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.140]   If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:56.500]   His major goal and the major goal of the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:02.020]   share by smaller, so they have some, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, all of them are making
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:03.820]   electric cars.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:09.380]   So what they've done is they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.620]   individual car.
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.620]   That's fucking nuts.
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.180]   What are you doing?
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:16.980]   That's one of the things they're doing, but automation is also another one.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:22.580]   But on the Elon side, there's also a hilariously named Boring Company, which is working on
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:30.420]   tunnels, which is actually expanding the flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:32.220]   of public transit, I think.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:38.220]   Listen, I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know what
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:40.420]   a public transit system is, period.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   - Yes.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.420]   - There's F-150 pickup trucks.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:43.420]   - Most Americans.
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:47.660]   - Well, this is an interesting, so--
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:54.460]   - The older, by the way, footnote, the older the city, the more likely it has public transportation.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.460]   - So you're saying--
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:56.460]   - Boston is the best example.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.460]   - Yes.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.460]   - Have you been, well, you--
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.460]   - Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah, I have a place in Boston.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:05.140]   - Boston, with the street railway, Boston is your case study of how to do this, 'cause
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:06.820]   they've been doing it all along.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.820]   New York's pretty good, too.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:13.620]   - There's a trade-off, yeah, New York, I would say, is better than Boston, because there's,
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:18.660]   their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.980]   It's almost like Boston's a little too old, but yes, I get your point.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:30.660]   But there is a, the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America, and there
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:36.980]   is a practical nature to the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:43.140]   some of these things that you're talking about with the working class, there has to be a
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:48.980]   central planning component, or there has to be a centralized component, and America is
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:56.540]   very much based on the idea of, at least in recent times, well, I would say from the founding
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.660]   of individualism, of respecting individual freedom.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:08.500]   Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life, you would
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.940]   trample on individual freedoms?
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   - No.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.940]   - Can you respect both?
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:21.140]   - Sure, for me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:27.620]   who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist, that's a motive for my Marxism.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:31.160]   It was for Marx, too, he loved the French Revolution.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:38.380]   He loved the Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, the great three, and then Democracy, the American
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.740]   contribution, if you like.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:41.260]   He believed in all of that.
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:46.940]   His critique of capitalism was it promised it, and then never delivered it.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:53.620]   The reason you have to go beyond it is because it didn't deliver what it had promised.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:37:02.900]   For me, it is the fulfillment of a genuine, but again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, so if you
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:11.100]   want, individualism, for me, is not the way it's set up in this society, some sort of
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:14.980]   antithesis to the government.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:21.700]   I think an immense con has been pulled on the American people, and the con works like
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.380]   this.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:26.500]   You know what's bad and what's dangerous and threatens you?
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.820]   It's the government.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:31.300]   The government's gonna come in and tell you what to do, the government's gonna run your
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.460]   life, the government's the problem.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:39.340]   There really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:44.580]   Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn, like the so-called Great Recession
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:45.580]   of 2008.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:48.020]   Who do they blame?
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.700]   The government.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:53.580]   Large numbers of people go unemployed, and what are the media all about?
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.480]   The government.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:58.220]   If I were a capitalist, I'd love this.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.540]   I'd kick the workers by throwing them out of their home, and they don't get angry at
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:05.060]   me, they get angry at the government.
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:09.180]   I fire large numbers of people, I have no responsibility for what happens to them as
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:15.260]   a result of having no job and no income, and they get angry at the senator.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.260]   I'm laughing all the way to the bank.
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:19.980]   This is a genius stroke.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.980]   In theory, but if you look at government, 'cause you said accountability in the capitalist
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:26.340]   system has no accountability.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.620]   There's some pushback I give on the accountability.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:33.780]   I think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Hegelian way.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:41.540]   There's more accountability for, I would say, that in theory, government is perfectly accountable.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.420]   That's the whole point of a democratic system, is you vote people in.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:52.300]   In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy that is accountable only on the surface.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:56.580]   There's two parties that seem to be- Are the same.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.740]   Are the same.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:04.060]   Media is somehow integrated into making the same two parties that are just wearing different
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:10.760]   colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing and bitterly arguing and calling
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.260]   each other's- Nasty names.
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:16.060]   Spouses, nasty names, and all those kinds of things.
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:17.780]   But that's government.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:22.140]   So what exactly is worse here?
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:23.140]   Government or companies?
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:26.580]   Well, why are we asking that question?
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.580]   These are twins.
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:33.660]   Look, what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats just now, with which I agree,
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:36.800]   I would say the same thing about corporations and the government.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   This is the same people.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.800]   Literally the same.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.100]   But let's go to Churchill.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:42.260]   Which one is worse?
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:46.940]   Let's go to Churchill, like democracy is the worst form of government except all the other
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.140]   ones or whatever.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.320]   So this kind of same idea.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.500]   Which one exactly is worse?
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:55.180]   Because to me it seems like- Which one between what and what?
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:58.660]   Government and industry and companies.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:07.020]   It's because government is plagued by, I would call it corruption because the corruption
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.780]   of bureaucratic paperwork.
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:13.380]   And then because they're not accountable.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.940]   There doesn't seem to be a serious accountability.
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.820]   Again, we're not living on the same planet.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:25.660]   The greatest practitioners of central planning are corporations.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:33.940]   Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other megacorps.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.540]   They have to plan.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:41.340]   They buy up companies because they don't want to deal in the market.
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:47.740]   They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs or sell their
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.460]   outputs to somebody they don't control.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.860]   They want the professor to teach the genius of a market.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:56.820]   They hate the market.
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:01.980]   And when they grow to be big, they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:08.020]   could better control them, which requires them then to plan the production and distribution
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:13.140]   of goods inside rather than buying them in the market.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:17.400]   The model of the government is the private corporation.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.980]   I have spent my life, give you an example, in American universities, big ones, famous
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.980]   ones, not just as a student but as a professor.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.460]   I've been to half a dozen schools.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.460]   I teach there at the new school here.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:31.220]   It's another one, right?
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:34.340]   They all model themselves after businesses.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:41.540]   They model their ... You can attack the bureaucracy of universities, good reason, it's a mess,
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:49.600]   but they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing their bureaucracy in a business-like
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.980]   manner.
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:55.280]   So you're looking at a difference which isn't there.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.860]   The government and the private sector are partners, and both of them wouldn't have it
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:02.340]   any other way.
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:07.820]   The corporations want that from the government, and the government now knows that to please
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:13.580]   the corporations is the number one objective they have because that's how they keep their
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.220]   jobs and keep their system going.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:20.860]   And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:26.900]   But there's important differences that, I don't know if they're fundamental or just
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:31.580]   a consequence of history, but if you have government, they're accountable in a different
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.340]   way than companies.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:38.420]   Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.500]   by sort of the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.140]   is selling.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:53.060]   The government is accountable by votes, and it seems like government, unlike companies
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:59.380]   for most of companies' history, is always too big to fail, meaning it can always just
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.820]   print money.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:06.260]   It can always save itself, and that creates a bureaucracy.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:12.540]   You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government.
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:18.780]   You distribute the blame, and it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions, so bad
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:20.980]   decisions in government accumulate.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:26.980]   So you become more and more and more inefficient, and more and more poor in your decision-making
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:32.180]   in terms of, you said public transit, should we build a public transit system in this city
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.180]   or not?
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.820]   That's a difficult decision, that's an interesting decision.
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:41.980]   I would say it's very often a very good decision, but whoever makes that decision should be
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:49.380]   accountable for a good or bad decision, and it seems like companies are more accountable.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:56.500]   They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:02.620]   There's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering decisions.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:07.100]   Government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:08.100]   Do you disagree with that?
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.820]   - I disagree with that.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:12.660]   Everything in my history pushes me.
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.060]   - You may be living, I may be living a different--
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.060]   - Who knows?
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.060]   - A planet.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:18.060]   - Who knows?
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:21.740]   - Or taking a different sort of drug.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:28.300]   I won't mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a very large company
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:35.780]   here in the United States, here in the New York area.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:42.960]   It involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a huge corporation.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:51.380]   One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo of the family, and he was more responsible
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:54.620]   than anybody else building it up.
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:55.620]   But he took care of his brothers.
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:58.420]   He had a nice feeling about his brothers.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:06.700]   The one brother who could not, without help, tie his shoes, became a vice president.
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.940]   Got an enormous salary.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:14.580]   Got a beautiful office in a skyscraper not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:23.180]   now, and that was the way that family handled that company.
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:29.940]   And all of his relatives were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever,
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:38.420]   because in my experience with this, and because I went to the schools I told you, all my experiences
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:46.060]   with that group of people, corporate, full of those stories, they made mistake after
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:49.220]   mistake, which they would tell you about.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:56.460]   Didn't undermine their ... They were always able to blame somebody else, something else
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.140]   that scraped them through.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.300]   And had they not been able to, they would have been replaced by another person who did
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.700]   the same thing for as long as they could.
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.220]   And they knew it.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.300]   They would talk about it at family events, that's how I know.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.300]   Yeah, that's ... I mean that ...
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:19.820]   I understand that you want the outside world to look at it this way, but it's not my experience.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:27.660]   But again, that kind of thing, at the risk of saying human nature again, I wonder what
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:33.100]   kind of system allows for that more versus less.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:37.180]   This is the question of ... I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.620]   corruption.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.420]   Which system allows for more corruption?
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.900]   But remember that the way I defined a different system is not more or less government.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.740]   It's more or less allowing a democratic workplace.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.060]   Reconfiguring it.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.740]   What happens when everybody has a vote?
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:47:01.340]   When you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a larger
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:07.020]   number of people than a board of directors or a major shareholders or whoever it is that
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.860]   most companies are responsible to.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:12.180]   And now you've got a whole different universe.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:14.060]   It's not a small group of people.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.860]   Can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.900]   Most of it, and on and on and on.
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:23.640]   This is ... worker co-ops is what this is called in many parts of the world.
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.260]   So it's not that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before.
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:28.640]   Not at all.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:37.420]   The Marxism I understand is to pick from historical precedents the things that we think will work
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.940]   better.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:43.900]   And I think if all the people in an enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:49.860]   decided they would never give two or three individuals $100 million while everybody else
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.340]   can't send their kid to college.
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:54.380]   I mean, they're not going to do that.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:48:00.600]   - So just to return, just to address this point about the particular implementation
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.180]   of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:11.640]   Why did Stalinism, for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, and human suffering?
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:22.000]   Is there any elements within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government,
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.640]   the kind of system that led to that bloodshed?
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   - I don't think so.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:32.600]   I think there were many things that led to the bloodshed, and so all that Stalin's regimes
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   did.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:43.880]   And I spent 10 years of my life with another economist writing a book about that to try
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.080]   to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.800]   You might want to take a look at it sometime.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.160]   But there, I'm going to say a few things now, but all of those things are spelled out in
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:06.440]   great detail with loads of empirical evidence, et cetera, in that work.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:12.640]   Let me start with playing a little bit with Hegel.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:20.560]   The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.960]   Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:32.200]   You had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a parallel from today.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:38.560]   The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.080]   World War I, it just fell apart.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.600]   The Czar and all of that, it couldn't survive.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.840]   It had already been in trouble.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.400]   There was a revolution in 1905.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:52.040]   There was the loss of the war to Japan.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.720]   If you know Russian history, which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.880]   up to the collapse in 1917.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:09.920]   And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.080]   the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:22.200]   Earlier on, with Kerensky, the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.200]   by Marxism.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:29.880]   It was people more skeptical and would not have been called Marxist probably by history.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.160]   They tried.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.160]   They couldn't.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:39.120]   Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.800]   The rest of the world, though, was horrified.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:50.440]   The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this immense leap from being a political party,
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:57.960]   a movement, critical of capitalism, yes, but still not challenging the power.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:01.400]   Now it had the power, and in a big country.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:03.880]   And they freaked out.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:10.600]   If you know American history, the leadership of this country went completely berserk.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:16.360]   We had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:27.740]   The '20s were a time of palmer raids in Boston, the Sacco-Vanzetti trials, really grim hostility.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:32.520]   And you had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520]   revolution.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.520]   The US, Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:49.040]   What you had right away was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:55.240]   There was a great professor at Princeton, Meyer, forget his first name, who wrote this
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:52:03.200]   wonderful book about all American foreign policy since 1917, has been obsessed with
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.200]   Russia.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:10.680]   Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:13.160]   Union, as if people haven't figured out.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:17.120]   That was a big change back in 1989 and '90.
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:24.160]   You know, Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least they're not Lenin.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:29.760]   They may not be so different from some of the others, but in any case.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:37.880]   So you had one factor was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:45.940]   I mean, Rosa Luxemburg, I assume you know, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:46.940]   of Berlin.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:52.000]   She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000]   bits, killed.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:53:00.640]   So you're attributing some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.480]   world turned away.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.480]   Turned against.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480]   Turned against.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   So if you turn against it, the better.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:12.880]   Yeah, I mean, not in order of importance, but it's a very important part of the psychology
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.160]   of being, you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite as much evidence
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.800]   that indeed there was a lot to be afraid of at that time.
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.800]   Nobody had ever done it.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:30.000]   Look, you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.540]   first that you could have socialism in one country.
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.800]   That was thought to be ridiculous.
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:39.040]   That socialism was internationalism.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.220]   Marx was against capitalism everywhere.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:48.360]   It was, you know, workers of the world unite, not workers of Russia unite, workers of the
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:55.600]   world, he had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms with the fact that
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:01.720]   the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin, was tried in Munich, was
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:06.560]   tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all failed.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.560]   They all failed.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.120]   And he's left.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:12.800]   So the French would say, tout seul, right?
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.640]   All alone.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.000]   That's one.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.360]   The second thing is economic isolation.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:25.560]   Russia's a poor country, and it needed what it got before the war, which were heavy investments
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.320]   from the French and the Germans particularly, but others too.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.280]   Now this was all cut off.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.600]   And you can see the replay with the sanctions program.
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.520]   It's, we're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.000]   We have to do, we have, the world is different and the sanctions don't work, but they're
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000]   gonna try them.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]   They're gonna try them.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.600]   'Cause it's the history.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]   But that culture was, today is completely different.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.800]   Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China, and that changes everything.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.440]   And they don't get that here yet, but they will.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.600]   - Yeah, there's a very complicated dynamic with China, even with India.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.080]   But-- - Or Turkey, Brazil.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:12.120]   - Sorry to say, human nature may change at a slower pace than does geopolitical trends.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.120]   - That has occurred to me as well.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.280]   I get that point.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:21.200]   - So is there, can you steel man the case, or consider the case that there's something
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:27.840]   about the implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:35.320]   on the working class and the workers unite, that naturally leads to formation of a dictatorial
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:45.520]   force, a dictator that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:51.760]   the details of how to run the democracy, of giving voice to the workers so that they get
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:52.800]   to choose.
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.800]   And then that naturally leads to a dictator, and there's naturally, in human nature, power,
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:03.560]   and absolute power, as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely.
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:08.760]   Is it possible that whenever you focus on Marx's ideals, you're going to end up with
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:14.280]   a dictator, and often, when you give too much power to any one human, a small number of
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.280]   people, you're gonna get into a huge amount of trouble?
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.440]   - You've putched things together there that I would--
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.080]   - That's what this-- - I think if you give--
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.080]   - Putched is a good word.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:28.720]   - Yeah, it's German.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:32.440]   If you, remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.040]   - And then your dad is French.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:38.200]   - Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know, European.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.680]   It's a city on the border of France and Germany.
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.800]   If you come from, Alsatian, Alsace, in German.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.800]   - So they're German-speaking, French-speaking?
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.440]   - Yeah, they do both.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:53.960]   It's bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times in medieval days already
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:59.040]   that it, literally, you go from one store to another, the proprietor here is French
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:05.200]   and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages because, you don't
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.200]   speak either of them?
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.200]   - I speak Russian.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.200]   - Russian, but not German or French?
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:10.640]   - A bit of Ukrainian, no.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.560]   It took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.640]   I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.640]   I'm sure I can remember.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:31.520]   If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long period of time,
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:39.160]   and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks and it
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:44.840]   stays, and you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution, and you will
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:51.940]   discover it has a life of its own, and it's gonna take a long time before people don't.
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:58:00.040]   If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism and that
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:04.400]   it doesn't wanna have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:10.240]   and Diana and all the others, and they were very human-like, but instead, we have one
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.000]   who is the absolute beginning.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000]   What are you doing?
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:21.160]   You're teaching people an authority line that comes from the individual.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:28.040]   If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner, the lord sits, called the landlord,
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:34.000]   he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on, and you do this for thousands of
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:41.000]   years, you can make a Russian revolution in 1917, but if you imagine you've gotten away
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:48.760]   from all that people assume without ever thinking about it, you're gonna have trouble.
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:54.320]   Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.320]   He wasn't.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:57.140]   He didn't never have that power.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:00.200]   He may have thought that, but I don't.
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:01.200]   He's the product.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.720]   Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind of guy.
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.640]   You know, he's a baseball-playing lawyer.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640]   That's what he was.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.000]   But they made him into Tadha.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000]   - So it's not the system, it's the people.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   - You're the product of history.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.440]   No, no, no.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:21.060]   It was the systems, feudalism, the church.
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:27.560]   It was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:33.560]   its own rhythm and doesn't follow the calendar of a political revolution.
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.680]   - That's the fundamental question.
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:43.760]   Is there something about communism that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:44.760]   or Mao?
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:50.920]   - No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:55.480]   what they find familiar, to what seems to make sense, and he's the guy.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.920]   Look, let me give you an example from American history.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:04.200]   The Republican Party has traditionally, in this country, been the party of private enterprise
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.600]   and minimum government.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:12.880]   In comes Trump, runs for office in 2016, is elected.
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:13.880]   What does he do?
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:21.640]   He commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive government intervention
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:26.240]   in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades.
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:28.560]   Nobody says anything.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.080]   The Republicans cave, and the Democrats largely too.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.080]   They cave.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:39.560]   He can throw a tariff on anything.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:44.720]   He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:45.880]   That's not what a tariff is.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:48.200]   It's not how a tariff works.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:53.680]   He would flunk a freshman course in economics, which everybody knows, everybody who teaches
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:54.680]   these courses.
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:57.120]   No, it doesn't matter.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.160]   He's still calling the shots.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:06.800]   What is going on here is that a society has come to a point where it can't solve its problems,
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.980]   and it begins what?
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:18.600]   To tap into older forms and all of the laissez-faire and all of the individualism for Lynn.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:24.960]   And suddenly, the Republican Party is gung-ho, and now they're going to make abortion illegal.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.280]   The government is telling you what you can do with your uterus.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.760]   What?
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.240]   What?
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:35.800]   The government is being given more and more and more and more power.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.800]   They're hoping, what?
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:38.800]   Do they like the government?
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:39.800]   No.
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:41.520]   They're desperate.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.960]   This is not a pro-government, and it wasn't in Russia either.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:52.760]   They were in a desperate fix, and so, and he took advantage.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:02:05.960]   To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the National Socialism
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:12.840]   Party of German Workers, hence the Nazi Party, the fascist party in the '30s and the '40s,
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:19.880]   at the head of whom was Hitler, which I just recently learned he was employee number seven
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.760]   of the party, or whatever.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:27.800]   The seventh person to have joined the party, and have created one of the most consequential
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.880]   and powerful political parties in the history of the 20th century.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:37.160]   What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play?
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:42.120]   It is the National Socialist Party of German Workers.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:43.120]   Workers.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:51.960]   National Socialist, the National Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, German Worker Party.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:52.960]   Worker Party.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.760]   National Socialist German Worker Party.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:56.760]   So-
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.760]   Well, here's the history.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:03.480]   Did he care about the workers, or did he just use the workers as a populist message?
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:10.320]   The only thing that Marxism did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.040]   power, but had nothing, no other, he didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.640]   about it, nor did the people around him.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.560]   Here's the story of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family, and
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.560]   plus my own history, the work that I did.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:30.240]   The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German Party.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.040]   It started around 1870, Marx was still alive.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:41.120]   Some of his own family were leaders, Ferdinand Lassalle and other, his daughters.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.740]   By the end of the century, it was the second most important party in Germany.
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.980]   Nobody understood it.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:55.560]   It was almost as big a shock to the Europeans as was the Russian Revolution in 1917.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:02.800]   Here was a political party that was now in every German city, in every German town, powerful
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:07.040]   and enjoying its rise up.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:11.240]   That's my family is involved in this, so I really do know the story.
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:23.640]   It meant that starting around 1967, '8, if you wanted to have any kind of presence in
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:27.360]   the German working class, you had to use the word socialist.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.280]   You had to, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.360]   The other parties called themselves Catholic.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]   Germany is divided.
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:40.720]   The northern two-thirds is Protestant, the southern third is Catholic.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:47.040]   Munich and Bavaria is Catholic, and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:52.680]   You could be in the Catholic Party, that was the South, or you could be in various conservative
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:55.320]   Prussian, and other.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:59.960]   If you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing, I mean, Germany
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:05.720]   a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:09.080]   Germany was the major competitor to Britain for the empire.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:15.080]   The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and US taking over from Britain's
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.080]   empire.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.400]   So, the German working class was it.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:27.560]   So, anybody who wanted to approach the working class in whatever way had to come to terms
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:31.480]   and be friendly to socialism.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.800]   Other parties did this too, just like Hitler.
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:39.720]   They put the word socialist in their party, but they wanted to make it clear that they
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:45.840]   weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union or anything to do with Marxism, so they put
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.240]   the word national.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:55.040]   Nazi is the first four letters of national, national in German, and Azi is how you spell
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.920]   national in the German.
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:59.200]   National socialism, but definitely not communists.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.200]   That's right.
[02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:01.200]   They killed communists.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.720]   They fought communists in the street.
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:05.800]   They had pitched battles.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:09.840]   They literally threatened each other's existence and their lives.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:15.160]   And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and gypsies and
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.120]   all the other people he eventually killed.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:18.720]   It was communists.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:22.480]   They were the number one, and socialists right behind them.
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:23.480]   Why?
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.840]   Because until he takes power, January of 1933, that's when Hitler takes power.
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:34.800]   The last elections, two of them, in 1932, the socialists and communists, they vote together,
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.880]   50% of the vote in Germany.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:45.360]   So he appealed to the German manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said, "The
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:48.480]   communists and socialists are going to win.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:50.480]   And you're just the capitalists.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:52.580]   You have too few people.
[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:56.360]   You need a mass base, and I'm the only one that can do that."
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.800]   And it was just a populist message that he used.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.800]   That's right.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.640]   But it was explicitly done as a deal.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:10.520]   The ruling group said to Hindenburg, the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:15.120]   government at the time, "You have to invite Hitler to form a new government."
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.760]   Otherwise, he would never have done it.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.720]   He had called Hitler nasty names before.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:25.640]   The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as a little funny man with a mustache who
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:28.480]   was Austrian, wasn't even German.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.820]   For them, that mattered.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:38.120]   So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism, which he immediately
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:40.940]   does.
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:48.440]   Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:55.260]   It's like there are people here in the United States who like to say, "We are not a democracy.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:08:00.200]   We are a republic," which is like saying, "I'm not a banana.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:01.200]   I'm a fruit."
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:05.800]   You have to explain to these people, "A banana is a kind of fruit."
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:11.960]   So you have to explain to people, "Yes, we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:14.360]   as a way to govern the republic."
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:17.960]   Because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have.
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:20.360]   You have to go through that with people so they get it.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:24.560]   And certain words have power beyond their actual meaning.
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:31.400]   They're used in communication, whether it's negative, like racist, or positive, like freedom
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.400]   of speech.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:33.800]   Or Democrat, with a D.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:36.760]   Yeah, and then you use that to mean something-
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:37.760]   Who knows?
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:44.960]   Or negative, "Donny, stop being a socialist," or whatever that means that's not even used
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:48.560]   in any kind of philosophical or economic sense.
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:50.800]   So let's fast forward to today.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:53.440]   You mentioned Bernie Sanders.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:59.000]   There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.320]   socialism and maybe let's try to start, sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.720]   mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.640]   She's from these parts.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:13.040]   Yes, Queens.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:18.440]   So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.320]   Are they open to some ideas in Marxism?
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:27.600]   Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.600]   Okay.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:33.720]   Where do I begin?
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:40.560]   The socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx, and has gone on to
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.320]   develop separately after Marx's death.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.320]   So-
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.320]   Can we pause on that actually?
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.920]   Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between Marxism and socialism?
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.120]   Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism-
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:58.040]   That's better.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:04.320]   Can you speak to like, maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   is?
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   Right.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:18.200]   Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics, and as I said earlier, devoted
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:28.280]   to mostly a critique of capitalism, and that's its strength.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:35.760]   How it does that, how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works,
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.280]   that is really the forte of the Marxist tradition.
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:46.400]   Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism figures.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:53.000]   It's there so that people who aren't Marxists are nonetheless aware of Marxism, like it
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.320]   more or less, study it more or less.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:01.880]   But it's a broader notion that I like to use this sentence to describe.
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:09.360]   It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really there are all kinds
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:19.000]   of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world think are
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.080]   adequate.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.680]   We are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they could do better
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:29.960]   than slavery, and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.920]   We've made progress.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:34.840]   Feudalism was a progress over slavery.
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.080]   Capitalism was a progress over both of them, and progress hasn't stopped.
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:47.800]   And we are the people who, in a variety of ways, want the progress to go further and
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:55.360]   are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best beyond which we cannot
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:02.240]   go or even think, we find that to be, in the worst sense of the word, a reactionary way
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.400]   of thinking.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:06.600]   And we're that large community.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.880]   Many of us are not interested in economics all that much.
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:13.520]   We don't think that's the focal area.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:19.680]   We are socialists, for example, because we want to do something to deal with climate
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.080]   change.
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:27.760]   We think the world is about to kill itself physically, and we want to take steps with
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:32.920]   other people to stop that, to fix that, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:37.000]   So that's, for me, a kind of difference.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.160]   It's a little difficult to say because there's no other figure like Marx that has an equal
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:50.820]   impact, an equal place within the broad socialist tradition.
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:57.360]   And the only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:03.520]   But that's very specialized, and that's a whole other kind of conversation.
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:11.120]   And whatever you say, the influence of the great anarchist thinkers, Kropotkin, Bakunin,
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:18.480]   Sorel and others, still doesn't amount to the impact that Marx and Marxism have had
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.720]   so far.
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:28.080]   That could change, but I mean, up to this point, I think that's a way of understanding
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.080]   the relationship.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.080]   - Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within anarchism, and of course it's
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:41.880]   one of the more varied disciplines, 'cause there's such, maybe by definition, such variety
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:52.840]   in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center, and that,
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:56.800]   if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:57.800]   - Absolutely.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:00.400]   - So where you have the, you know.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:07.040]   - There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas that uses the phrase,
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:11.080]   quote, "The withering away of the state."
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.280]   That's a quotation from Lenin.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.340]   People should understand, that's a quotation from Lenin.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:24.600]   And it was made by Lenin, positive, in other words, Lenin was saying, "That's a good thing.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.200]   That's something we stand for.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.480]   We want to create the conditions under which there is a withering."
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:37.240]   Because you remember, the communists, or whatever, they weren't called that at first in Russia,
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.440]   before the revolution.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.340]   They were just socialists.
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:43.920]   They were hunted down and persecuted by the government, left and right.
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.440]   They had no love for the government.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:49.400]   The government was their literal, everyday enemy.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:55.880]   And being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:02.140]   whole, being a Marxist, you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:03.940]   it is you're struggling against.
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:08.520]   So there was this interest, why is the state so important?
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:15.360]   Because if you understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.640]   One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia, and he goes back
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:21.640]   centuries.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.720]   It's a huge book, three or four inches thick, and I'm one of the few people who've read
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:28.320]   it.
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:35.560]   And he's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.840]   feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe.
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:45.520]   The development of a powerful central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:52.240]   desperate to hold on, which ought to be suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:16:00.080]   here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:10.480]   and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can not to be lost in history.
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.480]   It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:20.800]   A lot of people have asked that question over the years, a lot of people.
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:25.720]   There's Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night, erasing the withering away of the
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:26.720]   state part.
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:27.720]   Yes, exactly.
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.280]   So just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:36.720]   these modern political figures that represent some of these ideas?
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:40.160]   And they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism.
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.160]   Right.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:47.200]   The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and this is particularly true about Bernie,
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.760]   because AOC is much younger and Bernie is an older man.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:17:01.000]   Bernie being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student, as an activist,
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:07.320]   then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all the rest.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:12.980]   He lived through what, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.
[02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:19.280]   And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945, '46 to the present, I mean
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:26.960]   it really never stopped, was a Manichean worldview.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:32.680]   The United States is good, it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:37.180]   whatever the opposite of democracy should be called.
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:38.920]   Good here, evil there.
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:51.560]   It was taken so far that even among the ranks of academic individuals, it was impossible
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:53.000]   to have a conversation.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.840]   I mean, I can't tell, just to make it very personal, the number of times I would raise
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:06.880]   my hand in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale, and I would ask a question that had
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.240]   something to do with Marxism, because I was studying it on my own.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:16.920]   There were no courses that teach this to me, except by people who trashed it, other than
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:20.400]   that, and I didn't want that.
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:26.440]   So I would ask a question, and I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.520]   didn't much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear.
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:32.520]   It was just fear.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.520]   They didn't want to go there.
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:35.960]   They didn't want to answer my question.
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:40.560]   And after a while, I got to know some of them, and I found out why.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:44.280]   Because you don't know how the rest of the class is going to understand this.
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:48.120]   Either they would have to say, "I don't know," which would be the honest truth for many of
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:52.000]   them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, "I don't know.
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.240]   This is not cool."
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:19:00.840]   Or if they knew, they'd have to say something that indicated they didn't know really much,
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.760]   and they weren't going to do that.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:09.080]   Or they would know something, and maybe that would be because they were interested.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:13.920]   They did not want the rest of the students to begin to say, "Oh, you know, Professor
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:18.520]   Smith, you know, he's interested in—" "Mm-mm.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.480]   This is not good for your career.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:22.800]   You don't know how this is going to play out.
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.320]   Who's going to say what to whom?"
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.040]   And I could see in their faces what I later learned, because they told me, "Come to my
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]   office hours.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.240]   We're in the office.
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:33.680]   We can talk about it."
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:36.800]   But that's how bad it was.
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:38.440]   Is it not still?
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.640]   Pretty much.
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:45.120]   In my field, the great so-called debate—I mean, I find it boring, but the great debate
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:52.160]   for my colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:58.320]   Neoclassical, the government should stay out of the economy, let's say fair or liberalism,
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:01.840]   and the Keynesians saying, "No, you crazy neoclassical.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:05.760]   If you do that, you'll have Great Depressions, and the system will collapse.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:11.520]   You need the government to come in to solve the problems, to fix the weaknesses."
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:14.920]   And they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs.
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:19.080]   One of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:21.560]   me out.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:24.960]   That they can find common ground to do.
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:27.920]   So I had to learn it all on my own.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:30.280]   Why am I telling you this?
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:42.320]   Because this taboo means that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:50.920]   of the post-World War II period, the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to
[02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:56.280]   the average American person, but to the average American academic, to the average American
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:59.920]   who thinks of himself or herself as an intellectual.
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:06.200]   I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet history.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:08.720]   They have no idea.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.880]   Or saying, "There's this man Lukács, a Hungarian Marxist.
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:15.160]   He really had interest in..."
[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:19.860]   Or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic.
[02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:24.980]   He was head of the Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life.
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:27.160]   What does that mean?
[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:29.920]   You like Gramsci as a literary critic, but...
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:32.560]   And they didn't even know.
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:33.560]   They don't even know.
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.480]   It's been erased.
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:40.800]   It's a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:45.180]   in the Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor.
[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:50.200]   And so somehow all of his writings, many of which are very interesting and complicated...
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:59.120]   Anyway, so what you're going to have in this country is a slow awakening of socialism from
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:03.040]   a long hibernation called the Cold War.
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:07.160]   I never expected, to be very honest with you, that I would live to see it.
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:13.020]   I knew it would come because these things always do, but I didn't expect to see it.
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:20.260]   So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us, that when it starts to happen, it happens
[02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:21.260]   fast.
[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:25.820]   So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening...
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:26.820]   Absolutely.
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:30.300]   ...of the Cold War to accept the idea of socialism.
[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:32.020]   Bernie was always a socialist.
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:34.260]   We all knew, and everybody who paid attention.
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:35.940]   He denied it.
[02:22:35.940 --> 02:22:42.300]   But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president.
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:44.420]   He's just a senator from Vermont.
[02:22:44.420 --> 02:22:48.300]   Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union.
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:52.700]   People who live in Vermont love to tell you that there are more cows than people in Vermont,
[02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:54.420]   et cetera, et cetera.
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:23:00.340]   So here from this little state, this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs
[02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:03.100]   for... and says, "I'm a socialist."
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.860]   And when they attack him, he doesn't run away.
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:05.860]   "I'm a socialist.
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:06.860]   I'm a socialist."
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:09.140]   Now, he had been.
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:12.060]   It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out.
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:17.460]   But the great question, and I don't mind telling you because I went to the right schools.
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:19.620]   I know a lot of people.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:23.140]   Jani Ellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:27.940]   So I was speaking with a high official of the Democratic Party, and I said, "Well, what
[02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:31.580]   do you think about Bernie entering the race?"
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:32.580]   Makes no difference.
[02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:35.100]   He's going to get 1% of the vote.
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:36.100]   He was wrong.
[02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:39.300]   He had no idea what was coming.
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:41.520]   But the truth is, I didn't either.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:42.980]   It wasn't just that he didn't get it.
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:45.980]   I thought his 1% was probably right.
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:46.980]   So we were both wrong.
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:48.460]   Yeah, change can happen fast.
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:51.980]   Do you think AOC might be president one day?
[02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:53.620]   Yeah, possible.
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:54.780]   Possible.
[02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:56.580]   But two things.
[02:23:56.580 --> 02:24:00.760]   Number one, it's fast.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:07.560]   Number two, it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess.
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:18.380]   You begin with the most moderate, calm, non-confrontational socialism you can imagine.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:20.020]   So not AOC or Bernie.
[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:21.020]   No, no.
[02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:23.480]   They are not confrontational in my judgment.
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:24.840]   In terms of the ideas of socialism.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:27.240]   I mean, they're both very feisty.
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:28.520]   They're feisty personally.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:29.520]   But not-
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:30.520]   But not ideologically.
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:31.520]   Got it.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:35.720]   You know, she is, Bernie is also.
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.160]   You know, in honest moments, and they both really are pretty honest folks, at least in
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:44.340]   my experience.
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:49.880]   In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates as democratic socialism
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:54.120]   is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:01.280]   It was a kind of popular government, tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:05.800]   a lot more support for the working class than you do now.
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:08.120]   That's not a fundamental change.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.600]   That's what he means by socialism.
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:16.400]   When he talks about it and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.800]   Okay, that's consistent.
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:22.880]   That's the softest kind of socialism.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.960]   And that's where we're going to start in a country coming out of hibernation.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:32.200]   Pretty soon, it's already happening, there'll be people who need and want to go further
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:36.860]   in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are comfortable with.
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:39.880]   You can already see the shoots of it now.
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:46.200]   You know, AOC voted, together with most of the others, to support the money for Ukraine.
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:51.880]   Okay, that lot of people in the socialist movement do not support that.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:52.880]   And that's going to happen.
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:57.720]   I don't know exactly how that's going to work out, but that should give people an idea.
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:01.680]   There are disagreements and they're going to fester and they're going to grow.
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:02.680]   It's interesting.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:08.360]   People in the socialist sphere don't support money from the United States in the large
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:11.120]   amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.880]   Is it because it's a fundamentally, the military industrial complex is a capitalist institution
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:16.880]   kind of thing?
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:17.880]   No.
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:18.880]   I wonder what the-
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:20.880]   I mean, there are some people for whom that's the issue.
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:27.120]   Then there are people for whom this is, you know, it's guns and butter and why are we
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:31.040]   over there when we have such needs at home that are being neglected?
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:35.760]   And then there are people who, well, go back to what we talked about at the beginning,
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:39.600]   who are more like Lenin and Debs.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:47.380]   This is a fight between Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:50.120]   in Ukraine and what are we doing here?
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:56.800]   We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate a settlement.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.320]   Don't kill large numbers of Ukraine.
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:01.200]   I mean, everybody's willing to fight to the last Ukrainian.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.160]   It's a little strange here.
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:04.440]   What are you doing?
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:08.320]   You're supposed to be in favor of peace, you know, and for the United States, which just
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:14.600]   finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.600]   I mean, who in the world is going to take this seriously?
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:18.600]   This is crazy.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:23.120]   You know, I invade, it's good, and you invade, it's terrible.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.120]   What?
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:25.880]   You know, what are you doing?
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.560]   Why are you doing that?
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:29.720]   What's going on here?
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:34.120]   All of these questions are being acted, by the way, not just by socialists, by lots of
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:40.360]   other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:45.880]   You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine.
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.800]   They don't want the money spent there.
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.720]   They don't want the weapons sent there.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.560]   They don't like the whole policy.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.800]   And Trump wobble.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:58.960]   So Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the right.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:03.760]   And every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger.
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:13.760]   Anyway, the point is that AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:21.040]   after a long winter of Cold War isolation from the whole, you know.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:27.200]   When I explain to people the contribution made, for example, to modern Marxism, I'll
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.000]   give you an example, by the French philosopher Louis Althusser.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.720]   I don't know if the name means anything to you.
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:35.720]   Okay.
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.080]   He was the rector of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.680]   That's the equivalent.
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:48.640]   Imagine in this country if there were a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:49.640]   MIT.
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:51.840]   I mean, it would be the university.
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:56.600]   Well, the Ecole Normale in France in Paris is the.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:29:00.220]   He was a tenured professor who became the rector.
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.600]   The rector is like the president of the university, an active member of the French Communist Party
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.660]   most of his adult life.
[02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:10.240]   That was possible in France during the Cold War.
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:12.360]   That was unthinkable in this country.
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:15.880]   You could not, in a million years, right?
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:26.760]   So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring a version of postmodernism into Marxism with
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:33.440]   enormous impact all over the world where he traveled, not just in Europe, all over, right?
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:37.240]   So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for you.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.240]   Sure.
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.240]   L-O-U-S-S-E-R.
[02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:44.680]   Luis, the Luis is spelled L-O-U-I-S.
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:46.640]   Luis Althusser.
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:47.640]   Look him up.
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:48.640]   You'll see tons of stuff.
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:56.440]   By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works in English.
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:30:00.600]   By the way, the textbook I wrote in economics, in case you're ever interested, was also published
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:01.960]   by the MIT Press.
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:02.960]   And the title?
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:05.640]   Of the Contending Economic Theories.
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:09.120]   Ideoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:10.120]   That's at MIT.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:11.120]   Marxian.
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:16.800]   And by the way, when we think, I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:25.080]   Marxian economics and Marxist, I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that's-
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:29.320]   I only use it because Marxist, I use as a noun.
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.000]   A person is a Marxist.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.880]   Marxian, I use as an adjective to qualify.
[02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:36.920]   I don't mean some great difference.
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:45.120]   There's a last point I would like to make about AOC and Bernie that's also general.
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:52.760]   I'm a historian, too, and I know that the transition out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:57.600]   was a transition that took centuries, and that occurred in fits and starts.
[02:30:57.600 --> 02:31:02.480]   So for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate.
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:03.600]   Serfs would run away.
[02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:05.920]   They'd run into a town.
[02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:07.760]   How would they live in the town?
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.520]   They had no land anymore because they had run away from the feudal manor.
[02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:18.120]   A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding what they were doing.
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:24.480]   A merchant would say to one of these serfs, "I'm in the business of buying and then reselling
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:29.440]   stuff and living off the difference, but you know, I could make more money if I produce
[02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:34.080]   some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:36.120]   So I'm going to make you a deal.
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.640]   I'm going to give you money.
[02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:42.160]   Once a week I'll give you money, what we would later call a wage, and you come here and under
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:47.880]   my supervision you make this crap that I'm going to then sell, and this all works out."
[02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:56.840]   In other words, there were efforts, unconscious, not self-aware, to go out of feudalism to
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:59.320]   a new system.
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:03.040]   Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart.
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:11.080]   Some of them lasted weeks or months or years, but it took a long time before the conditions
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:16.360]   were ready for a kind of a general switch.
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:21.520]   And once that was done, it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:22.520]   have today.
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:25.020]   That's the only model we have.
[02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:29.480]   So for me, that's what I see when I look at socialism.
[02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:36.320]   I see the Paris Commune was an event, an attempt, lasted a few weeks.
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.820]   I see Russia.
[02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:40.800]   That was an attempt, lasted 70 years.
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:46.120]   Then I see, and you will fill in the blank, I see these are all early experiments.
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:51.600]   These are all, you learn things to do, learn things never to do again.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.260]   The good, the bad.
[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:54.840]   What do you build on?
[02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.240]   How do you learn?
[02:32:56.240 --> 02:33:00.680]   And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition, when it's serious, that's what
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:01.680]   it does.
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:08.320]   - So in your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over the feudalism.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:13.800]   And we are coming to an age in over slavery, and we're coming to an age where capitalism
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:20.460]   will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is somehow fundamentally broken.
[02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:24.360]   It's better than the things that came before it, but there's going to be things yet better
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:29.960]   and they will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism.
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:39.120]   Is there, just to linger briefly on the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter.
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:44.400]   There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but cultural
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:45.400]   Marxism.
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:46.400]   - Right.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:54.080]   - Criticisms of universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists.
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.440]   I'm not exactly sure, I don't pay close enough attention.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:58.440]   - No one is, no, no, no.
[02:33:58.440 --> 02:33:59.440]   I do.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:04.680]   - But it's woke, there's a kind of woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure.
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:05.680]   - Right.
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.840]   That's not you.
[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:08.360]   - What is the fundamental text?
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:09.360]   - Yeah.
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.800]   - Who's the Karl Marx of wokeness?
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:22.800]   All I do know is that there's certain characteristics of woke ideology, which is hard lines are
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:27.640]   drawn between the good guys and the bad guys.
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:35.520]   And basically everyone is a bad guy, except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:36.880]   that they're the good guy.
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:48.240]   And that applies for racism, for sexism, for gender, gender politics, identity politics,
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:50.840]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:57.960]   - Is there any parallels between Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever is being
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:00.600]   called Marxism on Twitter?
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.800]   - No, not much.
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:09.520]   Mostly Marx, you have to, one of the consequences of the taboo after World War II is that Marxism,
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.400]   like socialism and communism, become swear words.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:19.800]   It's like calling somebody, well I won't use bad language, but using a four letter word
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:21.560]   to describe somebody.
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:25.400]   So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist.
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:31.960]   In many circles, this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used.
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:37.080]   But it doesn't have a particular meaning that I can assess.
[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:39.720]   The closest you get is your little list.
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:49.760]   It is somebody who is concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation, gender, all
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:58.880]   of those things, and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms and I don't like any of these people,
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:04.280]   so I slap the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism.
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:10.240]   Because it isn't Marxism about getting more money or controlling the industry or all those
[02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:15.260]   things that dimly we know Marxists somehow are concerned about.
[02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:17.920]   So this is odd, since they don't know much about Marxism.
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:20.480]   I've always been interested in culture.
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:25.320]   I mean, Lukács, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that's what they're famous
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:31.600]   for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:38.400]   Gramsci writes at great length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:39.400]   and on and on.
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:42.160]   I mean, this is just ignorance talking.
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.160]   They don't know anything about that.
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:45.760]   They wouldn't know what the names are.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.960]   It's a label that summarizes, kind of a shorthand, "I'm against all of this.
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:55.520]   I don't want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country, and it always has
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:05.200]   been, or sexism or phobia against gay people, whatever it is that's agitating them.
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.640]   Marxism or socialism."
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.520]   It's like socialism is the post office.
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:14.520]   But I don't blame them.
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:17.160]   I mean, it's childish.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:18.880]   It's mean-spirited.
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:24.840]   But it comes out of the fact no one ever sat them down and said, "Here is this tradition.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:30.160]   It's got these kinds of things that people kind of share, and these big differences."
[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:38.040]   Look, an intelligent society, which this country is, could have and should have done that.
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:43.520]   It was fear and a kind of terror that made them behave in the way they did, and we're
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:44.800]   now seeing it.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:49.600]   Having said that, there is such a thing as cultural Marxism.
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:38:00.880]   What that is, is simply those Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:07.760]   that a particular culture is on the one hand shaped by capitalism, and on the other hand
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:12.080]   it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow.
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:20.560]   In other words, how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job and
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:27.960]   attitude towards sexuality, or movements in music, or whatever else culture?
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:32.640]   And there are Georg Lukács, this Hungarian, great name, isn't it?
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.440]   The greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:41.880]   And a modern name, just died a couple years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:42.880]   H-A-L-L.
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:50.960]   If I were teaching, which I have done, a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:54.720]   major blocks on the syllabus.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:39:00.880]   I would give you articles and books to read of their stuff, because it has been so seminal
[02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:03.320]   in provoking many, many others.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:07.640]   So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:11.440]   creates and the kind of culture that enables capitalism.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:12.440]   Yes.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:17.240]   And Marxists are particularly those who like to look at that interaction.
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:21.520]   In other words, they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture and how culture
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.240]   shapes capitalism.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.960]   There's another name I forgot.
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:32.680]   Stuart Hall is British, Gramsci is Italian, Lukács is Hungarian.
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:38.360]   The German is Walter Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:44.760]   He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that developed
[02:39:44.760 --> 02:39:49.680]   in Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.280]   cultural questions.
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:57.360]   It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:58.440]   politics.
[02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.760]   There were people who said, "You're leaving out very important parts of modern society
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:07.800]   that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it."
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:13.920]   And it was that impetus to open Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:19.680]   important to understand that this cult, and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:22.000]   they had a completely different meaning from this.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.840]   This is just bad mouthing.
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:27.840]   That's all it is.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:30.280]   Let me ask a more personal question.
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:31.280]   Sure.
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:36.840]   So for most of the 20th century, no, not most, but a large, many decades in the United States
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.880]   as a consequence of the Cold War and before, being a Marxist is one of the worst things
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:44.280]   you could be.
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:50.240]   Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:57.360]   mind where it was difficult, like self-doubt, difficult to know, like, "What the hell am
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:58.740]   I doing?"
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:04.440]   When you're surrounded by colleagues and people, you said prestigious universities, both personal
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:12.360]   interest of career, but also as a human being, when everybody kind of looks at you funny
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:15.440]   because you're studying this thing.
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:17.560]   Did that ever get you real low?
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.560]   No.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:21.080]   I know people who had exactly what you said.
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:23.080]   I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:27.800]   If I were you, I'd be asking me that question too.
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:28.800]   And what's wrong with you?
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.720]   No, nothing wrong with the question.
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:35.560]   And here's the honest truth, I don't know how anomalous I am.
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.120]   I really don't.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:43.960]   But the truth is, no, I have, if my wife was sitting here, she'd tell you what she tells
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:49.760]   me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:53.780]   But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:59.080]   It's part of it.
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.080]   What can I say?
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.720]   I didn't choose the time of my birth.
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:06.760]   I didn't choose the communities in which I grew up or the schools I attended or anything
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:07.760]   else.
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:11.920]   No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on marketing and economics.
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:14.120]   But you know, again, I'm Hegel.
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.000]   On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.560]   On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own.
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:26.040]   And the motivation when you do that is very different.
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.960]   I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook taking notes of what the great professor
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.280]   says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam.
[02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:38.200]   I don't have an exam.
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:48.200]   I'm doing something slightly risque, you know, kind of romantically different and oppositional.
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:54.920]   I was able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom
[02:42:54.920 --> 02:43:01.440]   situation, other students who felt enough similar to me that we could get together and
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:03.720]   read these books and talk about them.
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:10.840]   I had a number of really fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.920]   and their effort to teach me along the way.
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:21.200]   And I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools, I do know a lot
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:25.240]   of people who are in high places in this culture.
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:31.000]   And when I have been put in difficult positions, I often wave my pedigree and it works like
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.440]   garlic with the devil.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.440]   They back away.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:35.880]   They back away.
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:40.760]   Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige.
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.480]   - But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:46.560]   by this.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:53.960]   You're just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:59.120]   - Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.120]   differently.
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:07.400]   I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:10.360]   And nothing has happened to change my mind.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:23.320]   In other words, the development just kept giving me more and more evidence that this
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:24.320]   is.
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:28.960]   And I must say over the last 10 years, what's really changed the last 10 years.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:33.480]   I mean, I can't describe to you how big that change is.
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:37.360]   And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:44.800]   Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio
[02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:50.840]   thing or give a talk at some conference or something.
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:56.960]   Once every two or three months, I'd be invited and I would do it, like academics often do.
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:02.360]   I now do two to three to four interviews every day.
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:03.360]   So-
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.360]   - There's a hunger.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:07.360]   - There's a hunger.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:08.360]   - Wow, is there hunger.
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:09.360]   - It's fascinating.
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:10.720]   - And I wanna be honest with you.
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.280]   As I say at the end of some of my talks, I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:23.360]   from the podium that I lean into the microphone and I say, with as much smile as I can get,
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.520]   I'm having the time of my life.
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:28.520]   And that's the truth.
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:30.660]   That's the truth.
[02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:31.880]   I never expected...
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.560]   Look, I'm used to teaching a classroom, a seminar for graduate students with eight or
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:43.520]   nine or 10 students or a regular undergraduate class with 30 or an occasional introductory
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:45.360]   course with a few hundred.
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:48.360]   I've done all of those things many times.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:57.840]   But an audience that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all of that, no,
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:45:58.840]   that's new.
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:45:59.840]   That's new.
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:07.480]   - Is there advice you can give, given your bold and non-standard career and life, advice
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:13.480]   you can give to high school students, college students about how to have a career like that
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:19.520]   or maybe how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:23.120]   - Yeah.
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:25.320]   First of all, my advice is go for it.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:33.040]   The conditions for doing that now are infinitely better than they were when I had to do it.
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:37.920]   And I could do it and I'm happy I did it.
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:45.920]   Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted.
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:50.640]   And I've never regretted being a critic of this society, never.
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:53.080]   I find it edifying.
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:59.960]   I find it, I mean the gratitude people express to me for helping them see kind of what's
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:03.960]   going on is unbelievably encouraging.
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:04.960]   What can I tell you?
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:10.880]   - So that fills you with joy, pointing out that the emperor has no clothes fills you,
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:13.720]   that's a life not just important, it's a joy.
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:19.680]   - Because most of the people who say something like that to me are people who, if they had
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:25.760]   the vocabulary and some of them do, would say, "You know, I thought I was seeing through
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:28.440]   that outfit that I was wearing.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:29.760]   I thought it."
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760]   And they did.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:37.080]   And all they needed was a little extra, this information or that factoid or this logic,
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:38.720]   ah yeah.
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:39.720]   And they have that.
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:41.200]   And I remember having that too.
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:48.080]   When I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude.
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:50.960]   And now I get that gratitude a good bit.
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.640]   And yes, it is enormously gratifying.
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.320]   And I'm not sure I could get it any other way.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:07.600]   And I have learned, and I'm walking proof, that being a critic of society and doing it
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:15.000]   systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a very good life.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.960]   Very good life.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:25.240]   - Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:26.640]   Do you think about your death?
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:28.680]   Are you afraid of it?
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:29.680]   - Afraid of it, no.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:32.920]   Think about it, yes.
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.240]   I'm not afraid.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.480]   I've always thought, you know, death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead.
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.120]   It doesn't bother you very much.
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:46.040]   I worry more about my wife.
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.320]   I'm very attached to my wife.
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:52.840]   I might mention to you I got married when I was 23 years old, and that's my wife to
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:56.000]   this day.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:02.640]   So I'm lucky, because if you get married to anybody at age 23, it's either luck or it
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:03.640]   isn't.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.760]   - What role has love played in your life?
[02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:11.680]   - Enormous.
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:16.720]   Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mine
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:24.720]   were, who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:34.520]   find another life income and job, the disruption goes real deep for any refugee.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.020]   So my mother and father were both refugees.
[02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:43.440]   They met as refugees.
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.800]   So I had to, in a way, make it up to them.
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:53.360]   I had to be, I was the first child of their, I have a younger sister, but I was the first
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:54.360]   child.
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:50:01.000]   And, you know, there's a lot of psychological pressure on you if you're in that situation.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:07.840]   Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do what they couldn't, what was shut off to them
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:10.920]   in a way they want you to do.
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:15.440]   It's the closest they're gonna get to what they had hoped.
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:17.960]   And my parents were both university students.
[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:20.200]   My father was a lawyer.
[02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:26.880]   My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.
[02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:31.840]   So I had to perform, you know, I went to high school here in the United States.
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:36.920]   I had to get all As, I had to be on the football team, I had to play the violin in the orchestra,
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:42.080]   do all this because everything had to be achieved.
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:45.800]   So I'm an achievement crazy person that way.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:49.440]   But that's functional in this dysfunctional society.
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:55.040]   - But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this particular society.
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:59.920]   But then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game.
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:02.560]   Is that something that made you a better person?
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:06.120]   How has it made you a better Marxian and a better--
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:12.480]   - Everything, because my wife, my wife by profession is a psychotherapist.
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:14.400]   - Excellent, I love it.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.400]   - And I needed it.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:17.400]   And so I married it.
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:24.120]   I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I think as I look back on it, that was
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:26.960]   more than a little what was going on.
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:33.720]   And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my family
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:43.320]   never talked about, never dealt with, never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:44.880]   - Because it was all about survival.
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:47.080]   The immigrant challenge is survival.
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:48.400]   - Survive, survive.
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:53.800]   And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that.
[02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:58.520]   Of course you can, and there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems.
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:05.440]   But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way, and my parents did
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:06.480]   that.
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:08.560]   - One last question.
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.440]   What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff?
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:12.440]   Why are we here?
[02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:15.120]   - I will quote you, Mr. Marx.
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:17.800]   - Let's go.
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.160]   - Life is struggle.
[02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:29.400]   Now, for me, I have found that to be true, that the struggle, whether it is to build
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:34.800]   a relationship with your child, I have two children, whether it's to build one with your
[02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:43.280]   spouse, whether it's to understand a complicated argument and simplify it so that you can share
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:50.360]   the pleasure of understanding this relationship to a student or to an audience.
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:57.600]   These are, it's a struggle to do all those things, but that network of struggles, that
[02:52:57.600 --> 02:53:04.720]   makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:05.720]   - And meaningful.
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:06.720]   - Very meaningful.
[02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:09.640]   - And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully.
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:13.920]   You're one of the great communicators and educators out there today, and it's a huge
[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:17.000]   honor that you will sit with me for so many hours.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.000]   This is awesome.
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.000]   - Thank you.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.480]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:26.520]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:30.520]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:35.040]   The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:37.960]   The point, however, is to change it.
[02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:41.960]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:47.960]   -
