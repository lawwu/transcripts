[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Excellent question from a reader named Eli Tefft.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.360]   Curious why the Greek word namas is sometimes translated law but
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.480]   occasionally as principle like in Romans 7 21.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.680]   When the context refers to like a law given by God, a law given from Sinai, a
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.400]   law you shall do this, you shall not do that, we translated namas as law.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.000]   But there's another use of the word namas that appears for an example in
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.920]   Romans 7 21 where it has reference not to a commandment from God but a
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.600]   principle not so much as thou shalt or thou shalt not but what is the principle
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.680]   behind this.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   And it's the same Greek word but to distinguish between its meaning we
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.160]   translate it sometimes as law but sometimes as principle.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.900]   according to the context.
