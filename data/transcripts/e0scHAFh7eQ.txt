[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620]   All right, you want to have your Bible close by and we want to pick up and talk about the
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.960]   issue of communication here.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.220]   A biblical and theological view of communication for the Christian family is really critical
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.320]   here and in doing so, we're actually going to end up talking about four rules of communication.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   We've already had you read an article by Leslie Vernick, there in the Journal of Biblical
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.440]   Counseling about the fact that if all you do is just teach people how to communicate
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.160]   correctly, then all you're doing is making good Pharisees out of people.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.240]   You're getting them to perform on the outside in a certain way, where on the inside their
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.500]   hearts are really far from God.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.200]   It may generally improve the condition of their marriage, but in reality they'll eventually
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   go back to their default nature and their old sinful patterns of interacting with one
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.840]   another and they'll have the wrong desires.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   We don't want that.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.080]   We want to address the heart so that the heart really changes in people's lives.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.000]   Now when it comes to communication, here's a few little quick little comic strips that
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.840]   I think are really interesting.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.200]   Why is it that men and women have problems communicating?
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.720]   Well, this is a little comic strip called "Why We'll Never Understand Each Other."
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.420]   And you see here on the left what he heard, "You're way too stupid to be trusted driving
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.080]   alone in bad weather," what she said, "Drive carefully, dear."
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.240]   Or down here at the bottom, what she heard, "It's your lot in life to stop whatever it
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.560]   is you're doing in order to serve my every need," what he said, "Honey, do you know if
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.600]   we have any more AAA batteries?"
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.220]   Or maybe communication in the home looks like something like this, what he heard, "I'm going
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.400]   to make you wish you were dead for the rest of the week," what she said, "Tell me the
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   truth, honey.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.760]   Do I look fat in this?"
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.720]   Or what she heard, "Anything less than absolute perfection makes you an utter failure as a
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.960]   wife and a mother," what he said, "Mom is coming over for dinner."
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.360]   Or maybe this, what she heard, "Life as we know it will cease to exist unless you can
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.920]   alter the space-time continuum," what he said, "Honey, are you almost ready yet?"
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.680]   Or what he heard, this is my favorite one, "Honey, why don't you put your head in a vise
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.160]   and I'll turn the handle until your skull explodes," what she said, "Honey, why don't
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.560]   we just turn off the TV and talk?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.260]   Stick your head in a vise and I'm going to turn it until your skull explodes."
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.260]   Or lastly, maybe it's something like this, it says, "You're right," what he heard, "You're
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.060]   right to independent thought and ability to form an opinion has been revoked," what she
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.660]   said, "I do."
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.100]   I have some wives shaking their heads out there.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.420]   Why is there difficulties?
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.820]   Well, one of the things we can say for sure is that good communication in the Christian
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.700]   marriage does not happen automatically, it doesn't.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.340]   Why do we say that?
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.940]   Well, neither is the Christian marriage immune from problems.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.260]   Why?
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.340]   Well, because you and your spouse are sinners.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.580]   That's obvious from the Word of God, which by the way also tells us that there is no
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:13.140]   such thing as real basic compatibility, everybody on the planet is incompatible.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.140]   Everybody is.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.880]   At the very core, in our sinful selves, we are essentially egocentric, we are essentially
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.700]   selfish, we look out for our own desires and our own interests, we love ourselves way,
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.340]   way too much.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.220]   We don't believe in what Alfred Adler says, that somehow we're born by the age of six,
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.700]   we have this implanted inferiority complex and it controls us for the rest of our life
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.180]   and now determines every decision that we make until we are somehow able to strive for
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.020]   superiority or what he used to call superiority and that became too much of a pejorative term
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.660]   and so it eventually was called self-realization or self-actualization or somehow we have more
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.220]   love for ourselves, no, that's not it at all.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:22.160]   We're sinners, we're essentially self-centered, we're out for personal gratification.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.580]   And because you and your spouse are finite with sinful hearts as well.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.980]   That is, we're not infinite like God, we can't see what's coming around the next corner.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:41.120]   So two sinners living in a very cramped household condition eventually are going to bump into
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.820]   each other and that's going to cause problems.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.500]   In addition to that, your heart has various cravings and desires that conflict.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.900]   I mean everybody's heard of those books, men are from Mars and women are from what?
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.820]   Venus, that's right.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.780]   What's the basic idea within those books?
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:16.820]   Well the idea is that men are radically different from women and you can see this reinforced
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:23.660]   with other concepts like personality theories that are advanced, husbands sometimes have
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.780]   certain personalities, wives have certain personalities and these personalities are
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:36.500]   somehow conflict and that's what brings about dysfunctional marriages and dysfunctional
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   families.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.260]   Well nowhere in the Bible, a natural reading of the Bible would ever, never, ever render
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.260]   any of that.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.460]   That's not what James 4 says, James 4, if you want to grab your Bible real quickly,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.380]   what is it that James says causes fights and quarrels among you?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:06.500]   He says, well, he says, "Is not the source of your pleasures that wage war in your members?"
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.100]   James 4, 1, "You lust, you do not have, so you commit murder."
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.620]   Do I think that they were out running around committing murder?
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.740]   I don't think that was the case at all, physical murder.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.220]   But was there another kind of murder?
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.820]   Yeah, any kind of hate, this is similar to what Jesus said there on Matthew 5, where
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:34.020]   if you have hate in your heart, you're as good as a murderer.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:42.940]   So because your desires conflict with that of your spouse, there are going to be collisions
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.940]   within that marriage and collisions within home, certain desires that conflict that cause
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.740]   those arguments and disagreements.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:08:00.460]   And then hatred grows up.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:11.680]   And that hatred now is a form of ritualistic murder.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.980]   Around here, if you go to auto shops, you can pick up on some of that stuff.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.300]   You can get these little noisemakers you plant on your dashboard, and those little noisemakers
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:31.780]   you can, if you're traveling on a real crowded LA freeway, you can shoot the other person
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:42.020]   with a machine gun, or you can launch a missile at them, or you can throw a grenade at them.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.780]   It's just a little noise thing.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.620]   But what is that?
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.180]   All those people that are in front of you that are blocking your way in order to get
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.740]   where you want to go, you're just committing ritualistic murder with all those little sound
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.620]   devices.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   You're shooting them.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   You're killing them.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.660]   You're blowing them up.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.880]   Where does that come from?
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:09.220]   It comes from a deep-seated hatred and anger for someone who is getting in the way of your
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   desires.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.220]   What's your desire?
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.220]   Well, I want to get to my destination.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.220]   That's my desire.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.540]   And somebody else is in my way.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.740]   So I think this is exactly what is going on here in James 4 too.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:27.780]   There are certain desires that rule our hearts.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.440]   And we lust and we don't have, so we commit murder.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.420]   That is, in our hearts.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.420]   You're envious.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.060]   You cannot obtain, so you fight and you quarrel.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:44.620]   So you do not have because you do not ask, that is, God and with the proper motives.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.860]   You ask and you don't receive because you ask with the wrong motives, verse 3, so that
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.180]   you may spend it upon your pleasures.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.380]   It's what you want.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:10:04.540]   So there's disagreements, communication breakdowns because of these various cravings and desires
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:10.380]   that conflict in the Christian marriage.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:19.140]   Now we also know that good marriages and lasting, loving relationships can be built by couples
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.660]   who are committed to being God's kind of husband and wife.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.080]   We know that.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.340]   If you take to heart biblical principles, communication, your marriage can begin improving
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.580]   today.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.660]   That's something that you need to communicate to the people that you're counseling.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.580]   If you're really serious about this, about following biblical principles and you believe
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.500]   God's Word has the answer, you can begin improving today.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.660]   But you've got to be sincere in your desires to do things God's way.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:01.700]   That means He defines what is best for your marriage, not you.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.740]   He's the one who says this is what you should be doing and you're not doing, and you need
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:15.980]   to change.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:24.420]   Now the primary text that we're interested in is Ephesians chapter 4, beginning in verse
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.140]   25 and going down through verse 32.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:35.820]   We want to identify here four critical rules of communication that should go on in a marriage
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.420]   relationship.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.020]   And actually these four rules of communication can extend way beyond just marriage counseling
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.260]   into any kind of conflict between Christians.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:57.800]   But they're, and there's nothing special or magical about these four rules of communication.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:04.780]   They're just put together in such a way as to be memorable so people, if they're not
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:10.620]   around a Bible or they're not around their notes, can easily remember, am I failing or
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:17.380]   am I succeeding in following what God says I ought to be doing?
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.220]   These four rules of communication.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.780]   So we're going to be interested in verses 25 through 32.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now in order to understand this, I think it's going to be very important that we take a
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.540]   look at the context right, immediately preceding this text.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:44.340]   And if you understand the context here, beginning in verse 17 all the way through verse 24,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.740]   this is a very familiar put off and put on passage.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.900]   In fact, you pick up in verse 22, it says that in reference to your former manner of
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.260]   life, or you could actually translate that little phrase, former manner of life, your
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:06.280]   former pattern of life, your former way of life or habit of life.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:14.460]   He says, and then he gives us three Greek infinitives that are really telling here.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.300]   Number one, that you lay aside.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.000]   That's the first Greek infinitive, and this is a active middle voice.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:32.080]   So the emphasis is upon we ourselves laying aside the old self, which is being corrupted
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   in accordance with the lust of deceit.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:46.600]   So we have a responsibility to get rid of old habit patterns, old ways of responding
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.040]   to one another.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.440]   And you know, you're not going to be in the ministry very long or in counseling very long
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:14:00.780]   without realizing that couples begin to form habits of interacting with one another.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.080]   Every couple has them.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.420]   Every marriage has them.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.740]   Some of their habits may be good and some of them may not be so good, which encourages
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.600]   more misunderstandings.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   To lay aside, your active middle voice.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.000]   So the responsibility is an active middle voice.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.260]   The responsibility is upon us laying it aside.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.920]   Verse 23, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.020]   Now this is a present passive, it's no longer active middle.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.100]   This is present passive, which means this is something that is done to us by means of
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.380]   God's work in the spirit.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.380]   God renews.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:43.220]   And the word here renewed has the idea within its context of being refreshed or rejuvenated.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.380]   You have a refreshing, rejuvenated outlook upon this particular problem, where before
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.680]   maybe you had a negative or pessimistic view of this particular problem.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.780]   Now you have a rejuvenated, refreshing view of the problem in the spirit of your mind.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.680]   You're renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.300]   This is what God does to us.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.020]   We don't do it, God does it.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.420]   Verse 24, third Greek infinitive.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.780]   And then you put on.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.420]   Now we're back to middle voice.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:20.200]   The responsibility is we ourselves have a responsibility to put on.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.420]   So the first Greek infinitive is an active middle aorist.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.340]   The second one is present passive.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.620]   The third is aorist middle as well.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.540]   So we have responsibility to put off and put on.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:40.180]   Permanent change in the Christian life always involves putting off and putting on.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:46.500]   It's always two-factor.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.360]   So we put on the new self, which is in the likeness of God, has been created in righteousness
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.460]   and holiness of the truth.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.660]   So if there's really going to be change in the communication patterns between a husband
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.700]   and wife, they've got to be willing to see what they're doing that's wrong and get rid
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.700]   of that.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.660]   And then see what they should be doing and start doing that.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.020]   They really haven't changed until that's happened.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:22.460]   Now once you understand that background, then you can understand what we're talking about
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.100]   in these four rules of communication.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.060]   Now let me share with you one way I like to teach this.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.980]   In fact, I borrowed this little analogy from Dr. J. Adams several years ago, and it's been
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.340]   very helpful.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:43.660]   You remember the old game years ago where kids used to -- it was actually a joke.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.020]   They used to say, "When is a door no longer a door?"
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.820]   Remember that?
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   When it's a jar.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820]   Okay?
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.180]   "When is a door no longer a door?
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.660]   When it's a jar."
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:00.900]   Now you can use that as sort of like a paradigm for this in teaching the concept.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.980]   When is a liar no longer a liar?
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.100]   Or when is a thief no longer a thief?
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:16.180]   Or when is a -- or not a thief -- when is a sexually immoral person no longer a sexually
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.860]   immoral person?
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.820]   Well, most people will say a liar is no longer a liar when he stops lying, or a thief is
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.620]   no longer a thief when he stops stealing, or a sexually immoral person is no longer
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.220]   a sexually immoral person when they stop being sexually immoral.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:37.420]   Well, the Bible says, "No, that's not true."
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.540]   When is a thief no longer a thief?
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.940]   When he stops stealing?
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.940]   No!
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:51.020]   A thief is no longer a thief when he begins to work with his own hands.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.860]   A thief that has just stopped stealing is just a thief between jobs, all right?
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.900]   He's just waiting for another opportunity to be a thief again.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.260]   No, in fact, look at verse 28.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   He says, "He who steals must steal no longer, but rather must labor, performing with his
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.140]   hands what is good so that he will have something to share with one who has need."
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.580]   Well, what about a liar?
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.820]   When is a liar no longer a liar?
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.140]   When he stops lying?
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.780]   No, when he begins to tell the truth, see?
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.660]   So it's not enough just merely to stop lying.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:35.620]   A person has got to start telling the truth, being up front with the truth.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.300]   This is what is genuinely true.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.940]   So let's take a look at these four rules of communication in relationship to what we were
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.460]   just talking about.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:53.860]   The first one comes from verse 25 that says, "Therefore, laying aside falsehoods, speak
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:19:00.380]   truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are all members of one another."
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:08.140]   So first rule of communication is this, be honest, be honest.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:14.860]   And you notice how he talks about this in Ephesians 4.25.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.460]   He says, he talks about the fact that we ought to speak.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:29.900]   In fact, this is what we refer to as a imperative, you speak up is the idea.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.900]   Why?
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.100]   Because people cannot read our minds.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.780]   We have a responsibility to speak up with the truth.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.500]   So clamming up is out for the Christian.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.180]   It's not enough to just merely stop telling lies.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:55.340]   We've got to speak the truth, speak the truth each one of you with his neighbor.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:07.380]   So if we're supposed to speak, that means that if we decide to harbor things or clam
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.860]   up or not reveal something that's critical information to our spouse that would really
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:21.820]   actually be helpful in resolving this particular problem, then we're just as good as a liar.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.260]   Clamming up is not an option.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.060]   We've got to speak up.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.660]   Not only that, but we've also got to speak the truth.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.340]   Now speaking the truth here is a verb that involves continuous action with the present
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.820]   tense.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.840]   So in this sense, it has to be a new lifestyle in the marriage.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.740]   I'm always going to speak up.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.020]   I'm always going to speak out with the truth.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:58.360]   David says you must speak the truth from a heart of integrity, Psalm 15 too.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:04.300]   That is not deceptively or with disguised or hidden or with double meanings, but we've
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.900]   got to speak the truth from the right kind of heart that gets back to the heart motivations
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.180]   again and how the heart motivations have got to be right.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.940]   It's not enough to just merely perform the right thing, but it's got to come from a heart
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.980]   that's right.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:31.500]   So if we're going to really resolve communication problems, people have got to be honest.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:40.260]   Well not only must they be honest, but also we've got to be very careful on how we define
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.940]   dishonesty.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.500]   Sometimes we can be outwardly dishonest.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:54.140]   That's a deliberate falsification or deliberate lie or falsification or denial of the truth.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:59.540]   Or there could be incongruities where your speech is inconsistent with your halo data.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.700]   That means your nonverbal behavior.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.900]   Sometimes people can say such nice things in such hateful ways, right?
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.440]   Like the husband who says to his wife, "I love you."
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.540]   Now the words "I love you" are really sweet.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.380]   The way that he said it was not very sweet.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.900]   It was full of disgust.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.540]   "Do I have to tell you again?
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.860]   I've told you this in the past.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.700]   Do I really have to do that?"
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:37.900]   So there can be incongruities where our speech really is inconsistent with the tone of voice,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:48.180]   our inflection, our outward behavior.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.420]   So those can be there.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:56.220]   Or there can be all kinds of disguise communication.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.580]   The human heart is very deep and deceptive.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:10.500]   Disguise communication can be innuendos, insinuations, implied accusations.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.140]   That's not being honest.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.560]   That's not being forthright.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.900]   That's not allowing our yes to be yes and our no to be no.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:27.820]   On contrary, we have all kinds of fabricated ways to get around being responsible for what
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.120]   we've said or done.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.260]   So you get this idea that honesty is more than just not lying.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.140]   It has to do with being open and very honest with the truth.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:54.700]   Verse 25 again, "Therefore laying aside falsehoods, speak truth, each one of you, with his neighbor,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.980]   for we are members of one another."
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:07.060]   And it's pretty obvious that God wants us to do that from the heart.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:13.700]   We have a responsibility to speak the truth from a heart in this particular case of integrity.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.740]   Colossians 3.9 says, "Don't lie to one another since you laid aside the old self with its
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.260]   evil practices."
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.980]   That's part of the old way of life.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.620]   That's the way unbelievers deal with one another, but that's not the way in which the believers
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.020]   should deal with one another.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.460]   So we have to speak the truth.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:43.340]   Furthermore, we need to speak the truth earlier in verse 15, he's talked about this.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.860]   Speak the truth with love.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:52.260]   In other words, speak the truth lovingly.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.460]   Why does he say that?
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.860]   Because sometimes people can be brutal with the truth.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:05.740]   They sort of use the truth like a sledgehammer to beat somebody into the ground with it.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:13.340]   I remember having a guy in counseling who did that, where he said, "I told my wife the
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:19.780]   truth," he said to me, "I gave her a piece of my mind."
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:26.580]   And of course, you know, if you understand the creativity of my own mind, I'm thinking
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.860]   to myself, "Listen, you started with a very small mind to begin with.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.700]   You give her any more pieces, you're not going to have anything left."
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:39.540]   That's not what I said, I bit my tongue.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.580]   But that's a person who is brutal with the truth.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:49.440]   Sure he had told her the truth, but he had told her the truth in a very devastating way.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:57.320]   So if you speak the truth in spite and in anger, that's a wrong way to speak the truth.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.600]   God's concerned not just with what you say, but how you say it, the time that you say
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:08.560]   it, or if you speak the truth without forethought concerning the person that you're speaking
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:16.000]   to or about, that's a way that you can be brutal with the truth.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.940]   So Christians are to speak the truth, but they're supposed to speak lovingly.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.940]   What do we mean by that?
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:34.320]   We mean by that that you speak with the other person's best interest in mind, not just getting
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   off my chest.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.080]   "Well, I just got to get this off my chest.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.560]   I just got to tell you what I'm thinking.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.280]   I can't hold this back anymore."
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.480]   No, no, no, no, that's not the idea.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.520]   Christians don't talk like that.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.380]   It's not about you.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:55.780]   It's about how well we're speaking in terms of being beneficial to the person that we're
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.280]   speaking to.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   That's the ultimate determiner.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:09.000]   So I'm going to be very, very conscious about that.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   I like the verse in Colossians 4, 6, where it says, "Let your speech always be with grace,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   seasoned as it were with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each other."
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.360]   I love the analogy there because the analogy is to salt.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.720]   Now back in ancient times, salt preserved things.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   That's pretty obvious.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.600]   They didn't have refrigeration the way we have refrigeration today or certain preservatives.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.280]   So salt would preserve meats and other things would naturally go bad.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.480]   But there's another element that salt was used for.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:54.200]   Salt was also used for creating thirst, okay?
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.480]   You've heard the old saying, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:05.400]   The old farmer says, "Yeah, but you can sure salt his oats," all right?
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   That's right.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.640]   You can sure salt his oats.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.940]   And that's the idea behind this verse.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:19.760]   That is, when a person, when your speech is seasoned with grace, like salt, even though
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:27.560]   a person may be disagreeing with you, you say your side of the story so graciously,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.840]   so kindly that they're thirsty to hear more.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.000]   They want to hear more.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.940]   You're so gracious and you're so kind with what you have to say, they're willing to come
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.080]   back and hear some more, even though they don't agree with what you have to say.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:56.480]   Wow, that is gracious, kindly speech that has the other person's welfare first and foremost
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.760]   in our minds.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:08.700]   So in order to be a godly husband or wife, the first rule of communication is, be honest.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.700]   First rule.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:16.920]   Now, let's take a look at verses 26 and 27, which brings us to our second rule.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.560]   Verse 26 says, "Be angry and yet do not sin.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:26.360]   Do not let the sun go down in your anger and do not give the devil an opportunity."
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:32.560]   Second rule of communication is this, keep current.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   Keep current.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:40.920]   And you notice what he says here, "Be angry and yet sin not."
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.440]   Why?
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:49.600]   Because all anger is not sin, self-centered anger is always sin.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.920]   I didn't get my way.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.640]   I want to see my ideas prevail.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.480]   Nope.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.100]   That's very self-centered anger.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.480]   That's always sin.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.800]   But sometimes you may be righteously angry at your spouse.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.240]   I have a good reason to be angry.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:20.600]   What they did or what they said or what they didn't do or what they didn't say, you have
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.600]   a good reason.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:28.800]   But even that anger can become sinful anger when it's left unresolved.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.840]   That's where he says, "Don't let the sun go down on your anger."
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:38.280]   In other words, you hold onto that anger for a long period of time and it goes unresolved
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.800]   for a long period of time.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.200]   It's like raw meat.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.640]   Raw meat has the elements within it, the bacteria within it to cause it naturally to go bad.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.600]   And that's what's going to... it starts off the right way.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.440]   You have good reason and a righteous reason to be angry, but if left to ferment for a
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.200]   period of time, it really goes bad real quickly.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.240]   Don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.920]   Why?
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:11.640]   Well, there are a number of reasons why this is a problem.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:22.480]   Number one, obviously, we're guilty of sin because God has said, "Don't do it."
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.120]   I remember I had a couple, they had been married for about 20 years.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.080]   Their marriage had been somewhat rocky and they had eventually come in for marital counseling
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.320]   and I was going through these rules of communication, these four rules of communication, I came
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.560]   to this particular point in talking with them about it and I'll never forget, the husband
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.920]   kind of sat back in his chair and folded his arms.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.480]   He said, "Well then, I'm moving to Alaska."
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.120]   It went right over my head.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.120]   I'm going, "What?"
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.320]   Oh, and his wife caught on.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:03.640]   She rolled her eyes and she said, "You know, the sun shines for like 12 hours or 23 hours
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.880]   a day up there and he wants to hold on to his anger against me."
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   I said, "Whoa!"
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.920]   Now, I did give him points for creativity.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.400]   I said, "No, no, no, back up the train here.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.920]   This is not what we're talking about.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.360]   This is just a colloquialism.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.400]   It means deal with your anger ASAP.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:31.240]   Deal with your anger as soon as you have the opportunity to do so, you deal with it.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.920]   It's not literally waiting until two minutes before sunset and all of a sudden you're sitting
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   down with your wife or your husband and deal with your anger.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.020]   You deal with it as soon as possible.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.960]   It was a colloquialism that meant that.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:50.200]   It's not literally you wait until sunset before you, or just before sunset for you to deal
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.440]   with your anger.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.920]   Although, I thought that was rather creative.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.560]   Some months in the summer, the sun shines for 23 hours and they only have one or two
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.360]   hours of darkness and, wow, no, no, no, no, that's not it.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.040]   So they're guilty of sin if they haven't done that.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:13.320]   Not only that, when you allow your anger to ferment, then you open the way to resentment
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.160]   and bitterness.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   That's pretty obvious.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.920]   Sometimes I like to call it spiritual gunny-sacking.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.680]   You know what a gunny-sack is?
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   It's an old term.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   It's a hunter's term.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.840]   When a hunter would go out and shoot rabbits or quail, you know, they would take the rabbits
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.480]   and quail and throw it in their gunny-sack and they carried it around with them until
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.420]   they got home in the evening and they'd dump out their gunny-sack and then they'd clean
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:53.760]   all their prey and have it for dinner or, you know, store it in some way.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.200]   But people do that with their problems with one another.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.440]   They spiritually gunny-sack them.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   They don't deal with them.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.280]   They just throw it in their spiritual gunny-sack and they keep throwing it.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.640]   There's one problem with their wife or their husband, they throw that in there and the
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.200]   next day, there's another problem, they throw that in there, it's unresolved, and the next
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.600]   day another problem and two or three more problems and the spiritual gunny-sack just
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   continues to grow.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.180]   You can't literally see it, but nevertheless, it's affecting their whole attitudes towards
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.320]   their spouse.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.200]   And then one day, they know, they've been laboring under carrying this thing around
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.560]   for such a long time.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.520]   And their spouse does little thing, I mean, comparatively, just a very, very little thing.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.320]   And all of a sudden, they decide to empty their spiritual gunny-sack and empty the whole
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.600]   thing out all at once and boom, becomes a big issue.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.680]   And the spouse is there, "What did I say?
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.440]   What did I do?
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.360]   It's not what you said or did, it's who you are."
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.080]   Now, why do they say that?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.400]   Well, because this whole thing has distorted the way that they view their problems.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.280]   It totally has distorted it.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.360]   It distorts subsequent problems.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:07.680]   And bitterness and resentment grows as a result of it.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.060]   So that's the idea.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:17.320]   There's distortion of subsequent problems, you open the way to bitterness and resentment
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.600]   there and then forth.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.680]   The Bible says that eventually, with this bitterness and resentment, you endanger your
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.260]   physical relationship.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.280]   The sexual relationship and marriage is now in danger.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   You know why?
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.660]   Because nobody wants to go to bed with their problem.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.200]   Nobody wants to do that.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.440]   Nobody on this planet, there's not a woman on this planet, there's not a man on this
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:48.280]   planet wants to go to bed with their problem, since the other person is the problem.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:59.620]   And then we run into admonitions like 1 Corinthians 7, 5 that says, "Stop forbidding or withholding
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:13.760]   yourself from one another sexually."
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.740]   And because that opens the way for Satan into the relationship.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.920]   So you're guilty of sin, you open the way to resentment and bitterness, you distort
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.740]   subsequent problems, you endanger your physical relationship.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:35.380]   And then grab your Bible and go over to Matthew chapter 6.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:43.060]   And we're interested in verse 34, there on the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus says,
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.580]   "So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for itself.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.740]   Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.220]   That's the reason why he's encouraging.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.500]   There is this just Hebrew principle that's very prevalent here.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.180]   Deal with each day's problems that day and don't carry that day's problems into the next
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.940]   day because then you have the next day's problems plus the previous day's problems and then
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   you carry those problems into the next day and no, no, no.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.840]   You keep very, very short accounts.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.100]   That's what has to happen, very, very short accounts.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:25.020]   You don't let things go on and on and on and on and on unresolved wrong.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.740]   So rule number one, be honest.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.220]   Rule number two, keep current.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:35.820]   Rule number three, verses 29 and 30, "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:40.460]   but only such a word is as good for the edification according to the need of the moment so that
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:45.260]   it will give grace to those who hear and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.380]   you were sealed for the day of redemption."
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:54.140]   Rule number three is attack the problem, not the person.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:59.220]   Attack the problem, not the person.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:07.900]   Now this is really critical here because there are all kinds of unwholesome words and I think
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:17.420]   part of our difficulty here is that our view of what is unwholesome is a very narrow view,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.620]   very narrow, okay?
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:27.860]   We think cursing, swearing, taking God's name in vain are unwholesome words.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   And they are.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.380]   That's unwholesome words.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.720]   But it's a very, very narrow view.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:40.420]   When Paul's here talking about unwholesome words, it's a much broader view.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:46.620]   He says, notice what the verse says within its context, "But only such a word is good
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.540]   for edification according to the need of the moment."
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:58.060]   In other words, he says anything that would tear another person down is unwholesome.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.620]   It doesn't have to be a swear word, it doesn't have to be a curse word, you don't have to
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:08.300]   take God's name in vain, all you have to do is tear that other person down in some suggestive
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.460]   way and that's an unwholesome word.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.700]   In fact, the Greek word here for unwholesome is the word rotten.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.580]   That's a rotten word.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.980]   It's a rotten word.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:27.140]   So don't let any rotten word, it was a word that was often used, referred to in the classical
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.800]   Greek to refer to like rotten fish.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.980]   Nothing more repugnant than that.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   Very rotten.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.980]   Ruben?
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   >> Sarcastic?
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:46.620]   See, sarcasm in the midst of a conflict can be a type of rotten word.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.060]   Like you can say, well, in a sarcastic, you're always uncaring.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.060]   What does that mean?
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.500]   You say, well, I was only being sarcastic.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.460]   No, that actually tears down another person.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.340]   Now, are there times where a person, where there's no conflict involved, no misunderstanding
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.580]   between people, where sarcasm could be used hypothetically?
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.700]   Yes, if that's what you're asking.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.380]   I think there could be and it wouldn't be a sinful way to use it.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.020]   But where there's conflict, there's a disagreement and a couple's having a hard time communicating
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.020]   with one another.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.420]   Sarcasm is not good.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.700]   What does unwholesome words do?
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.180]   They zero in on the other person's character.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.260]   It calls into question their integrity, their character, who they are.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.880]   You end up tearing them down.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.140]   You end up demolishing their character.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:56.420]   It's words like you always, you never, you turkey, you idiot, you dummy, stupid, dumbbell.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.740]   We never let our kids say that.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:02.520]   Those are as bad as curse words in our home.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.020]   Is it true they always?
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.840]   No, that's 100% language.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.340]   Is it true they never?
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.080]   No, that's 100% language too.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   You turkey.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.100]   You know, what is that?
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:22.300]   That's just something to tear down someone else.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:27.180]   So we have a tendency to only label curse words as unwholesome, which is a very narrow
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.460]   definition.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:33.540]   God's definition on the contrary is much broader.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:46.380]   Instead of these unwholesome words, here this verse says, verse 29, "We have to use edifying
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:52.820]   words, that which is good for edification."
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.580]   The word edification just actually means to build up, to build up other people.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.580]   Words that do that.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.780]   What are those kind of words?
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:09.700]   These are words that focus in on the problem, not on the character of the other person.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.660]   I'm focusing on the problem.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.540]   They're selected in order to make it easy for two people to find a solution.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:23.740]   They're solution-oriented words that are full of graciousness, full of graciousness.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.660]   They always have your partner's welfare first and foremost in your mind.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.940]   Not your own welfare, but their welfare.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.100]   Like for instance, "I disagree with what you've done, but I'm open to hear your side of the
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   story."
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.980]   Or, "I want to find a solution to our problem that will be best for you in our home."
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:47.060]   Or, "I want to work through this with you so that Jesus is honored in our marriage."
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.380]   You know, there are some couples, if they were to say that in the midst of their marriage,
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.700]   their spouse would probably have a heart attack.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.940]   "All right, who are you, and what did you do with my real spouse?"
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.340]   This is so radically different.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.020]   "I disagree with what you've done, but I'm open to hear your side of the story."
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:11.340]   Or, "I want to find a solution to our problem that will be best for you in our home."
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:18.560]   Or, "I want to work through this with you so that Jesus Christ is honored in our marriage."
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.600]   Those are very deliberate words intended to edify the other person.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:31.640]   That doesn't mean that you totally agree with them, but it's intended to build them up.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.880]   Edifying words.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.600]   That's why we say attack the problem, not the person.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.880]   When we attack the person, we tear at their character.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.200]   We tear them down.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.560]   We call into question their integrity.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:58.880]   No, instead we approach the problem together in order to find a resolution to that problem.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.440]   So rule number one, keep current.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.640]   Rule number two, be honest, excuse me.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.000]   Rule number two, keep current.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.340]   Rule number three, attack the problem, not the person.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.120]   Rule number four, it's verses 31 and 32.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.800]   "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   with all malice.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.440]   forgiven you."
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:33.960]   Rule number four is this, act, don't react.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:40.240]   Four rules, be honest, keep current, attack problems, not people, act, don't react.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.520]   What are reactions to problems?
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.440]   You can see them in verse 31.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.640]   Bitterness, which is perpetual animosity that leads to harsh and unloving opinions about
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.720]   other people.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   There's wrath, which has to do with outbursts of passionate rage.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.680]   Boy, sometimes can that happen in a marriage?
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   Absolutely.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:07.960]   Anger, which is a subtle, deep-flowing anger that can occur between individuals, or clamor,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:13.800]   which has to do with outcry and shouting, or slander, which is speaking evil of another
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:20.880]   person that often comes from some kind of settled indignation towards them.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.200]   Now, sometimes you'll get counselees to say, "Well, that's not true of us.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.040]   We're not bitter or wrathful, or we don't practice this anger or clamor or slander."
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:39.400]   Well then, Paul sort of throws in at the very end of this list an item that is a big blanket,
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:48.800]   covers a lot of areas, and he adds to this, "along with every form of malice," or the
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.880]   New American Standard says, "along with all malice."
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.120]   You say, "What is that?"
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:03.400]   Well, malice is just a general wishing of ill will towards another person, which is
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:15.600]   the root of all the earlier vices, a general wishing of ill will, just wishing bad things.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.040]   I remember when I was in high school, I sat next to a girl in English class.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.000]   No matter how hard I studied or how well I did, she always got a better grade than I
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   did.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.440]   She drove me nuts.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:34.640]   I remember sitting there thinking in class, "God, if you'd just let her flunk one exam,
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.000]   God never gave me my wish."
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   That's malice.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.800]   That's a general wishing of ill will towards someone else.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:51.220]   It's like the wife and husband who have an argument early in the morning, and he goes
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.280]   tearing out the door, and she stands there washing the morning breakfast dishes and thinking
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:07.600]   to herself, "I hope he has a horrible day at work," she says, in her mind.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.560]   It's malice.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:17.240]   He goes tearing down the road in his car thinking to himself, "I hope the children make her
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.920]   life miserable today."
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.800]   That's malice.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.120]   That's wishing ill will towards somebody else.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.040]   He says, "You get rid of all forms of that.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.760]   All of those things are sinful reactions to problems."
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.800]   That's what they are.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.920]   Instead, verse 32, actions.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   What are the actions?
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.920]   There's three of them.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:58.760]   The key ones here that he uses in verse 32, "Be kind," he says, number one, "useful, worthy,
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.080]   good, benevolent toward your spouse.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   Be kind to them."
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.720]   That's the way we're supposed to do it.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   That's what we put on.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.840]   We put off all those other things in verse 31.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.200]   We put on kindness.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.800]   What's the kindest thing I can say?
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.360]   What's the kindest thing I can think?
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.200]   What's the kindest thing I can do for my spouse?
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.960]   The second one is tender heartedness.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.040]   Literally here in the Greek, it's having healthy vows.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.680]   In the Bible, they are the seed of emotions and intentions, therefore it means being compassionate
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.040]   with your partner.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:37.640]   So having good emotions towards your spouse.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.680]   The Bible assumes that we can do that.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:46.880]   We can decide to have healthy emotions towards someone else, even though we've been in conflict
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   with them?
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.600]   Yes, even though we've been in conflict with them.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.300]   Tender hearted is the way a lot of translations translate this.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:05.560]   And then third, we're to put on forgiveness, forgiving.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.580]   To exercise grace in releasing the offense of your spouse that includes the willingness
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:15.960]   from the heart, like Jesus talks about in Mark 11.25 and the verbal granting of forgiveness
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.700]   when repentance has taken place in Luke 17 verses 3 and 4.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.240]   So we are to be forgiving.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.720]   So we have four rules of communication.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Be honest, keep current, attack problems, not people, act, don't react.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.620]   Those four.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.680]   And often I'll say to marital couples, I'll say, okay, now when I'll teach these, I'll
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.500]   have them keep copious notes on what we're talking about.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.560]   And I want the father to go home and teach this to the rest of the family and I want
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.200]   mom to create all the visual aids.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.360]   She's going to put a little poster, the four rules of communication.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.960]   She's going to make sure that posted around the house at key places where everybody can
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.160]   see them are these four rules of communication.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.600]   Be honest, keep current, attack problems, not people, act, don't react.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.840]   Everywhere they look on the mirrors in the restrooms, everywhere they look there's four
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.840]   rules of communication.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.640]   Now we in our household, we're going to live by these four rules every day.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.760]   We're going to learn brand new habit patterns of interacting with one another so that we're
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.940]   living in a biblical way.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.000]   Those four rules.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.080]   Those are really key.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:37.960]   And I'll tell you, when a family decides to really practice those, it radically changes
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.320]   that home.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:52.880]   And the benefits that in a sense swirl around this are unexpected in all those relationships.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:51:00.880]   Between the parents and the kids, between mom and dad, the benefits are huge.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:07.960]   All right, let's pick up and talk a little bit about God's design for marital union,
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.120]   a biblical and theological view of sexual relationships in the Christian marriage.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.720]   Really critical issue here.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.480]   And oftentimes you'll find yourself having to deal with this in counseling quite a bit.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:27.680]   So, and in fact, probably in the past two weeks on at least three or four different
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.840]   separate counseling appointments, I've been dealing with this.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.380]   In some cases it's dealing with counselors that I'm supervising who are working with
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.800]   other people.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.840]   But this becomes a big area when it comes to husband and wife relationships and a big
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.120]   area for misunderstanding.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:52.880]   You know, the top three, they always say, sources of conflict in marriage is sex, money,
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.320]   and in-laws.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.320]   Those three things.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   Sex, money, and in-laws.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:01.760]   Well, this is right at the top there, which has to do with misunderstandings in terms
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.080]   of sexuality.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.600]   So let's take a look at this and keep your Bible handy.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.700]   When we deal with this in the Christian domain, oftentimes what you encounter is what I like
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.400]   to refer to as a Victorian approach to union in marriage.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.840]   This Victorian approach says that sex is a dirty topic.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.240]   It's really sinful.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   It's nasty.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.800]   You shouldn't talk about it.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:33.520]   And so in many Christian homes, very rarely, unless it's about something negative about
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.240]   sex, sex is not really dealt with at all.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.500]   That's not the way the Bible treats it.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:44.280]   But yet there are a lot of Christian homes who do treat this as a really dirty topic.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.840]   You don't talk about it.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.020]   It's a bad thing.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:56.720]   If you swing clear to the other end of the spectrum, you get a more recent view of this,
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:03.780]   and it's kind of a post-modern liberal view or liberated view.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.820]   Sex is the highest of human relationships.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.040]   It's what really makes a good marriage.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:14.820]   And if you're not having great sex, then there's something seriously wrong with your marriage.
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:19.900]   That's just as wrong as the Victorian view.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:26.220]   And yet that seems to be a more prevalent view in the day and age in which we live.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.460]   So you've got these two extremes.
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.900]   On the one hand, you've got sex is bad.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   It's dirty.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   It's a nasty topic.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.140]   You don't want to have to do anything with it.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.860]   Or you've got this liberated view, which makes sex the highest of all human relationships.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:47.400]   In fact, there's a Christian book that was published, oh, probably about 15, 20 years
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.820]   ago talking about this, entitled The Act of Marriage.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:59.980]   It's really a very poor title because sex is not the act of marriage.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.780]   It is an act of marriage.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:08.100]   Just because two people have had sex, like two gerbils can have sex, does not necessarily
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.220]   mean that that's marriage.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.380]   That's really quite a Roman Catholic view of marriage.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.100]   It's not a Protestant view of marriage.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.260]   For them, sex equals marriage.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:24.860]   That's not true with us because any two animals can have sex.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:30.140]   Now, sometimes when we talk about this particular subject, one of the first things I do is I
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.940]   want the couple to understand, grab your Bible just for a moment, let's go over to Romans
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.500]   chapter 12.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:42.700]   The context of this doesn't have anything to do with sexuality directly as a topic,
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:50.180]   but there is a broader theological principle that is applicable to anything we do in life,
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:55.140]   including sexuality, and that's verse 9.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:01.800]   Romans 12, verse 9, "Let love be without hypocrisy, abhor what is evil, cling to that which is
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   good."
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:08.540]   The word "abhor" can be translated "hate what is evil, cling to that which is good."
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.540]   And sometimes I say to couples, "Listen, if after talking through what the Bible says
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.460]   about sex, and you find out that in your marriage and in your relationship you're violating
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:25.140]   what the Bible says, then you've got to get to the point where you hate that violation.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.020]   You've got to get to that point.
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:35.340]   You hate that violation, and then you cling tenaciously to that which is good."
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   So are you willing to do that?
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:41.240]   Are you willing to say, "Okay, if the Bible teaches that, and I'm not doing it, I know
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:47.960]   I'm violating what the Bible says, so I need to learn how to hate that because that's evil.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:54.060]   I'm sowing discord in my marriage when I do this."
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:59.260]   So we've got to hate what is evil, cling to that which is good.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:06.560]   So if we violate God's word in the sexual realm, we've got to learn as a husband or
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:14.080]   as a wife to hate that violation, and then change.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.480]   Now let me give you six principles.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.520]   Six principles that I believe help to sum up the biblical teaching about sexuality.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:29.960]   Number one is this, that sex and marriage is pure and holy.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:33.200]   From the very beginning, we have that understanding.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:41.120]   Genesis 1, verse 27, and then later on in verse 31, God creates Adam and Eve distinctively
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.640]   male and female.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:53.800]   He creates Adam distinctively male with gender distinctiveness from Eve, and God created
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.560]   man in his own image, in the image of God.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.040]   He created him male and female.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.620]   He created them.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:09.600]   God created Eve distinctively female, and they both bore the image of God.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:15.160]   She bears just as much of the image of God as he does.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:21.120]   And in creating both the husband and wife, later on after Eve was created, she's the
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:26.640]   last bit of the creation that's created, and we see that in chapter 2.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.600]   Then chapter 1, verse 31 says, "God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   good."
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:36.280]   It was very good.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.200]   This is not a bad thing, this is a good thing.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:46.360]   So how dare we consider something that God has called "very good" to be somehow evil
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.880]   or ungodly.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:58.920]   This is what Hebrews 13, verse 4 says, "Let marriage be held in honor by all, and let
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   the marriage bed be undefiled."
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:13.400]   He says, so the marriage bed is good, it's a good thing, and it is to be kept undefiled
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:21.240]   by introducing into that marriage bed practices, or even other people that would defile that
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:27.720]   marriage bed, or selfish practices, as we're going to find out in a little bit, that could
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.040]   defile that marriage bed.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:37.360]   Because I ask Christian couples this, is it possible for a husband and wife who are Christians,
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:45.160]   who love each other, who only have sex with one another, in their sexual relationship,
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:51.440]   while having sex with just one another, could they still be in sin?
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:58.480]   Most Christian couples would say, "Well, not if they're having sex with just each other."
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:10.240]   And I want to suggest that they could be still practicing sin in their sexual relationship.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:17.400]   Let me explain why in our next couple of principles here.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:25.120]   So sex and marriage, first of all, is pure and holy, which gets us away from this Victorian
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.920]   view that somehow, sex is a bad, nasty thing.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]   It's not.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.400]   It is a very good thing, and God intended it to be very good.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.840]   In Genesis chapter 2, then he talks about it was both Adam and Eve who was both naked
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.040]   and they were not ashamed.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:48.280]   This is a good thing.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.680]   Sometimes we picture it as if it's bad.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:55.640]   The second thing that I think is important here is that sex is not the basis of marriage
[00:59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.080]   and marriage is not a sexual relationship.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:06.040]   Which sort of gets us away from that post-modern view, clear over the other extreme.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.280]   Why do we say that?
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.800]   Well, sex certainly is a very important part of marriage.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.940]   Nobody denies that at all.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:21.300]   It is an act of marriage, not to participate in it wholeheartedly, aggressively, and passionately
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:27.140]   is a sin against God, your spouse, and self.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:33.500]   But we're going to hasten to say that sex does not equal marriage.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:40.620]   That certainly is a Roman Catholic view.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:50.460]   And John Murray has a great discussion of that in his book on divorce, yes, a Roman
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:55.340]   Catholic view of marriage.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:03.340]   Sex equals marriage, and if a young guy and girl who have not been married before ends
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:09.460]   up having premarital sex, most of the time Roman Catholics and even a lot of Protestants
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.300]   will do everything they can to get that couple married, when in reality they're demonstrating
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.940]   the fact that they do not have enough personal self-discipline to maintain the discipline
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:25.100]   of marriage.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.820]   Sex does not equal marriage.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:35.900]   John chapter 4, Jesus deals with there the woman at the well, and he talks about her
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:46.780]   prior relationships that he had, and even though she was with these men, these men were
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:52.120]   not necessarily her husbands.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:02:00.420]   Unity in marriage goes, is much more than just mere sex.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:06.780]   And marriage success is much more than just sexual success.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:12.580]   When you read Christian books that are written on sexual intimacy within marriage, a lot
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:17.620]   of them are built upon a very pagan, secular idea that that is, you don't have a great
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.220]   marriage until you have great sex, and that's not true.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.340]   It's not true, never was true.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:32.540]   Marriage, sex is not the basis of marriage.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.740]   And marriage is not primarily a sexual relationship.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.780]   That almost makes sex a god.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   You say, "What is it?
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.780]   What's the biblical view?"
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:48.700]   Well, grab your Bible, let's go over to 1 Corinthians chapter 7, and we're interested
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.740]   in verses 3 through 5.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.320]   Here's the physical relationship within marriage, it says, "The husband must fulfill his marital
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.700]   duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband."
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.100]   That's verse 3.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:08.540]   So from the very beginning, this brings us to principle number 3, sex has as a primary
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:13.360]   goal that of satisfying your spouse.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.980]   That's the goal of sex.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:21.760]   Sex has as its primary goal that of satisfying your spouse.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.860]   It is a husband's responsibility to make sure that's his duty to his wife.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:32.820]   It is a wife's responsibility to make sure that is her duty to her husband.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:40.840]   Now, let me tell you, that is not the view of sex therapists out there in the world.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:48.300]   In fact, I'm working with a woman who's counseling another woman, and this woman's having a difficult
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:55.220]   time accepting the principle that it is her responsibility to make sure that her husband
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.700]   is absolutely fulfilled in the marriage.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.820]   And why is she having a problem accepting that?
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:05.940]   It's because she has gone to this sex therapist, and she wants to believe the sex therapist
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:13.140]   over believing what the Word of God says.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:19.100]   And basically, almost all those theories that are out there in the psych world on this issue
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:28.020]   has to do with your own personal fulfillment, which is a very self-centered view of sexuality.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:36.100]   First Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 3 is talking about making sure your spouse is fulfilled.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.660]   That changes everything.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   So the goal here in sex is not getting pleasure, not having a climax, not necessarily to conceive
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:54.900]   children, it's providing joy to your spouse, which incidentally parallels exactly what
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:00.100]   Proverbs chapter 5 says.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:06.100]   When Solomon admonishes his son there in Proverbs 5 about the marital relationship and sexual
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:15.140]   relationship, he says, "Drink water from your own cistern," verse 15, "fresh water from
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   your own well.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:20.260]   Should your springs be dispersed abroad, streams of water in the streets, let them be yours
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.820]   alone and not for strangers with you, but let your fountain be blessed and rejoice in
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.580]   the wife of your youth."
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.180]   So now it's interesting, in ancient times and in the Bible, and especially in the book
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:39.700]   of Proverbs, sex is referred to, and you've got to understand the context and the setting,
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:47.100]   it's a very arid desert type of climate, sex is referred to as refreshing water.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:55.780]   And what is it that a cistern, verse 15, a spring, verse 16, streams, verse 16, fountain,
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:02.340]   verse 18, all have in common, well, they all store and control water, that's what they
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.100]   all do.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:10.460]   So sex within its proper boundaries, that is cistern, well, springs, streams, fountain,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.140]   within marriage is a very good thing, within proper boundaries.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.380]   Sex outside of those boundaries, like water that's overflowing, like we get rains here
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:27.180]   in Southern California come down through those canyons, overflowing can be very, very destructive,
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.300]   sex outside of those boundaries.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:39.280]   So he says, verse 18, "Let your fountain be blessed and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.580]   you need to find your satisfaction in her, she finds her satisfaction in you," verse
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.420]   16, "should your springs be dispersed abroad, streams of water in the streets, she should
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.900]   get a refreshment only from you."
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:01.380]   So that's why we say it is providing joy to your spouse.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:09.780]   In fact, right there in that same context, he refers to it in the right type of context,
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:16.500]   or in the right type of marital relationship, verse 20, "For why should you, my son, be
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:22.340]   exhilarated by an adulteress and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?"
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:26.220]   Early in verse 19, he says, "be exhilarated always with her love," that is referring to
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:31.300]   his wife, and the word exhilarated is the word that literally means to be intoxicated,
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.860]   it's the same word that was used to be intoxicated with alcohol.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:43.500]   So the Bible recognizes that sex has an opiating effect upon the person's brain, same way that
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.020]   alcohol has an opiating effect upon the person's brain.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:57.980]   That's why sex can be so enslaving, and that's why later on it says a person can be enslaved
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.540]   by it, verse 22, "his own iniquities will capture the wicked and he will be held with
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.540]   the cords of his sin."
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:10.380]   In fact, Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 26 talks about the similar thing where Solomon
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:18.860]   talks about those men who have been enslaved by sexual things, been captivated by them.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:25.280]   So the idea here in the Christian marriage is that we have to retrain our thinking from
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.620]   that of getting pleasure to that of giving pleasure.
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:39.320]   It's my responsibility as a spouse to make sure my spouse is absolutely 100% fulfilled
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:46.340]   in this area.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:52.280]   Now you may think this is crazy, but this is, and the reason why I think we think it's
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.300]   crazy is because it's 100 degrees the opposite of what the world tells us.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.940]   And we're used to what the world says, it's constant cadence is to communicate that which
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.420]   is opposite to us.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:10.980]   But you were created uniquely male or uniquely female, not for self-fulfillment purposes.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:16.320]   You were created uniquely that way for the fulfillment of your spouse.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.540]   That's why you were created that way.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.580]   I'll never forget, several years ago, counseling this young husband and wife, they'd been married
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:32.660]   for a few years, and they were having sexual problems, and we started going over these
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:40.260]   very principles, and right in the middle of them, the wife started rolling her eyes, and
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.060]   I said to her, "What's wrong?"
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.380]   And she says, "You don't understand.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.820]   I know where you're going with this."
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   I said, "Well, where am I going with this?"
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.780]   She says, "I know where you're going with this.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:01.380]   You want me to make sure that he is absolutely 100% fulfilled sexually, right?"
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.900]   "Yeah, you got it.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.300]   Yeah, I'm a pretty good teacher."
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.860]   She says, "You don't understand my husband.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.460]   His sexual drive is unrelenting.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.620]   This is all I'm going to get done.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.420]   I won't get anything else done.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.740]   I'm not going to get anything else done.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.740]   You don't realize what you're doing to me."
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.100]   I said, "Well, I'm not doing this.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.700]   This is what the Bible says, right?
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.020]   If you're going to argue, argue with what God says.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.540]   Don't argue with me.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.340]   I'm just communicating it.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.340]   Don't kill the messenger."
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.700]   Oh, she just rolls her eyes.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.900]   So I said, "Okay, here's the assignment I'm going to give you this week.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:48.620]   This week, every day that your husband comes home from work, every day, I want you to be
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.740]   standing behind the door with the nicest negligee, you know, the one he really likes.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:11:02.340]   I want you to grab him by the hand and take him to bed with you, all right?"
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:07.180]   And she goes, "Ugh."
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.260]   So she's shuffled out.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:18.720]   He kind of leaped out of the room, "It's going to be an exciting week."
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.080]   So a whole week went by.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.260]   They came back the next week for counseling.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.780]   And it's interesting.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.820]   She comes bounding in the door.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.100]   He comes shuffling in the door.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.200]   And they plop down, and I have prayer with him, and I say, "Well, how did it go?"
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:39.700]   And she looks at me, and she slams her hand on the desk and says, "Pastor, this Bible
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.700]   stuff works!"
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.640]   I said, "What do you mean?
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   What happened?"
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.600]   She says, "Well, the first day I did exactly what you told me to do.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.720]   I stood behind the door.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720]   I grabbed him by the hand.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.860]   When he came in the door, I took him to bed.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.860]   Second day, did the same thing.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.600]   Third day, did the same thing.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.420]   Fourth day, did the same thing.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.580]   Fifth day, he come walking in the door and said, 'I'm fine.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.260]   I'm perfectly fine.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.620]   Everything's good.'"
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.620]   She says, "This Bible stuff works!"
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:14.580]   And all of a sudden, she had a renewed appreciation for how true the Bible is.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:21.380]   When she began to define, it's her role to make sure he is absolutely fulfilled, and
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:27.780]   it's his role to make sure that she is absolutely fulfilled, then you have that kind of great
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   relationship.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.660]   That's the kind of communication that should go on.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:37.300]   She should be saying to him, "Sweetheart, how you doing?
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.640]   Do we need to get together tonight?"
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.420]   He ought to be saying, "Sweetheart, how you doing?
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.020]   Do we need to get together soon?"
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.140]   That's the kind of communication that should be going on between a husband and wife.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:57.300]   The question, according to 1 Corinthians 7, 3, is not, "When do we have sex?"
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.040]   It's never the question in Christian marriage.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.740]   The question is always, "When do we not have sex?"
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:08.160]   That's always the question in the Christian marriage, "When do we not have sex?"
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.000]   Sex is always assumed in the Christian marriage.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.600]   It's always assumed.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:23.400]   I remember just back a few years ago, I did a whole Valentine's Banquet.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:31.200]   Actually, it was a seminar and banquet for a whole weekend, but up in the Sacramento
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   area.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:39.080]   In fact, we went up to Lake Tahoe with this church, and we taught on this very thing,
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.540]   that the pastor had asked us to come in, because it was all couples, all married couples in
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.540]   the group.
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:47.360]   So, we taught on these very things, spent time.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:55.320]   In fact, our key verse for the weekend was Ecclesiastes 9, 9, which talks about, "Enjoy
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   the wife of your youth."
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.920]   In fact, my theme was, "Ecclesiastes 9, 9, will you be my Valentine?"
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:09.460]   That was the theme for the whole weekend.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.240]   We taught on the physical relationship and marriage and stuff.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:21.160]   About 10, 11 months later, I get a phone call from the pastor, and he says to me, "Wow,
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.560]   I kind of really wish you wouldn't have come to our church."
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.120]   Man, you don't usually get a phone call like that, and you're going, "Really?
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120]   What's the problem?"
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.800]   He says, "Well," he says, "I want you to know that after you did that whole marriage
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:46.460]   seminar around Valentine's Day, that we have the nursery exploding, and we don't have any
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.960]   room left in the nursery of our church.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.240]   It's just exploding all over the place.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:01.120]   Your baby's being born left and right here, and everybody attributes it to that Valentine's
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.560]   banquet and that whole Valentine's weekend."
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.720]   Well, at least they're obeying God.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:17.080]   Sex has as its primary goal that of satisfying your spouse, and children, then, are the byproduct.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.960]   The goal of sex is not kids.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.200]   It's the blessing of it that comes, because you know as well as I do, there are some people
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:30.880]   who can have sex that, for some reason, don't have kids, but they can still fulfill this
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.760]   biblical admonition.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:41.800]   Fourth, not only that, but look at verse 4, 1 Corinthians 7, 4.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.840]   The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does, and likewise
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.480]   also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.380]   So principle number 4, God created both the husband and wife with an equal ability to
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.040]   satisfy each other.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:07.600]   The implication here is that once you're married, this body of yours no longer solely belongs
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.120]   to you.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.400]   Your spouse has a stake in your body.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.080]   While you're single, that's not true.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   When you're married, now it's true.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.000]   Your spouse has a stake in your body, so you can't do anything you want with it.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   You can't exhaust yourself during the day and have nothing to give your spouse at bed
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.480]   at night.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   That's bad, because then you're using your body for very self-centered purposes.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.760]   The honey I've got a headache doesn't cut it here.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.360]   Or I'm too tired doesn't cut it here.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.960]   Then you're exhausting all the energy of your body, and you're leaving nothing for
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.580]   your spouse.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.120]   She has a stake in her husband's body.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.200]   He has a stake in his wife's body.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.600]   There is co-ownership there.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:10.240]   None of this extreme feminist or masculinist idea that our bodies are our own and nobody
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240]   can tell me what to do with my body.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.520]   It's not true in the Christian marriage.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.920]   1 Corinthians 7, 4.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.920]   We are co-owners.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.560]   When I got married, my wife owns my body.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.680]   I have a stake in her body.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.880]   What she does with it, what I do with it.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.120]   So that's really critical here.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.600]   So no one has sole power or authority.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.640]   You do not have the independent.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.840]   You do not have this independent of your spouse.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:52.200]   That means then that both need to be aggressive in fulfilling this responsibility of satisfying
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.440]   our spouse.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:58.880]   So sexual relationships have to be equal and reciprocal.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:08.320]   As Ecclesiastes 9, 9 says, that we have a biblical responsibility to fulfill or to enjoy
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320]   our spouses.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.520]   Let me go over there.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.400]   So Ecclesiastes 9, 9 then talks about the fact that enjoy life with a woman whom you
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.120]   love all the days of your fleeting life which he has given you under the sun for this is
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:27.120]   your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.600]   God graces you with that.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.520]   That is your reward.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:40.760]   So in this particular case then, she has everything that she needs to fully and completely satisfy
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   her spouse.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.040]   God's given her that.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.840]   He has everything he needs to completely and fully satisfy his wife.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.080]   God has given him everything he needs for that and they should be content with that.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.920]   There's no other person or no other thing on the planet that can be any more satisfying
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.900]   than their spouse.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.720]   That's really critical here.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.640]   God has created both this husband and the wife with an equal ability to satisfy each
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   other.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:16.520]   Then number five, pleasure then in sex is not sinful and forbidden but it's assured
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.100]   and even encouraged.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:27.000]   We already saw that in Proverbs chapter 5 where we're dealing there with Solomon and
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.880]   his son.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:37.200]   God wants, verses 18 and verse 19, the husband and wife to enjoy each other, to be intoxicated
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200]   with marital love.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.880]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:45.000]   So, satisfying your spouse is a deeply satisfying experience for you.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:54.800]   We are to be ravished, intoxicated, exhilarated by them, Proverbs chapter 5 verse 19.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.240]   The problem is, is that our personal pleasure is not the main goal.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:10.040]   The fact that God gave us an enjoyable experience in satisfying our spouse is the side benefit
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.480]   but it's not the main purpose.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.160]   Then let's go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 5.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Then he says, "Stop depriving each other except by agreement and for a time so that
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.960]   you may devote yourself to prayer and come together again so that Satan will not tempt
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.160]   you because of your lack of self-control."
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:37.160]   First Corinthians 7 and 5 then brings about this principle that sexual relationships need
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.520]   to be regular and continuous.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.760]   He gives us four guidelines for not having sex here in this verse.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.600]   One is by mutual agreement.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:51.520]   This is not a good time for both of us and that's okay as long as your spouse is fulfilled
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.900]   and satisfied, you're good.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.240]   There has to be an agreed upon time.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:03.400]   In other words, there's a certain time where we're not going to have sex for a time, he
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   says.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.920]   Then some translations say fasting and prayer.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:15.360]   Most of them say prayer here but whatever the case, this is a good example.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:23.640]   For instance, someone has the flu or someone's had a surgery or there are times that are
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.800]   and usually with fasting and prayer, it usually had to do with crisis times.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:34.120]   This is not a good time for sexual enjoyment because of this crisis that we're going through.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:43.120]   Then he says, "Then terminate again, terminate that is not having sex and start having sex
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.480]   again as soon as possible."
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.480]   Why?
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:51.760]   Well, notice he says, "So that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:22:01.600]   Once you're used to an ongoing, regular, satisfying sexual relationship, it's hard to stop and
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   not be tempted."
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.720]   It's very hard.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.760]   This is where marriages get themselves into trouble.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.420]   A husband starts withholding himself from his wife, a wife begins to withhold herself
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:28.560]   from her husband and then Satan sends a nice young lady along and all of a sudden, the
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:34.520]   husband now is starting to pay attention to this nice young lady or Satan sends along
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:41.760]   a nice young man, her direction and she begins to pay attention to this nice young man.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.120]   Why is that?
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:50.720]   Because they are violating what God has clearly said to do and that is they should have an
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.160]   ongoing, regular sexual relationship.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.840]   That's why I said the question is not when do we have sex in the Christian marriage.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.000]   The question is when do we not have sex?
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.320]   Then there has to be an agreed upon time.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.480]   First Corinthians 7-5 is clear.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.320]   It has to be by mutual agreement.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.580]   How many people do you know say, "Hey listen, we're not going to have sex tonight because
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:17.840]   we're going to spend the evening in prayer instead?"
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:23.120]   Not many Christian couples I know that do that, but fasting in prayer and then terminate
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.360]   again so you can start, terminate not having sex and then start again is the idea.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:40.700]   Now this naturally leads us into the issue of birth control for the Christian marriage.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.920]   In order to understand this, I think we're going to have to take our Bibles and go back
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:59.120]   for a moment to Genesis 3-16.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.520]   To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.240]   In pain you will bring forth children and your desire will be for your husband and he
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.120]   will rule over you."
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:17.000]   The biblical paradigm for making decisions here I believe stems from Genesis 3-16.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.020]   Most translations here supply the word "in" and that particular little preposition is
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.880]   not in the original language.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.280]   It's not there.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.560]   Or the word "childbirth."
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.280]   The Hebrew literally is "and."
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:43.540]   There's the "vav," "and childbirth" is the idea.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:56.800]   Part of the curse was that Eve had a difficulty, had a greatly increased capacity for childbirth.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.640]   For the sake of argument, some theologians have suggested that before the fall she could
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.120]   only have a child maybe once every 1,000 years.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.660]   Why?
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.920]   Because they live forever.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.240]   They live forever.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.960]   She didn't need to have a child more often than that.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:24.720]   Can you imagine that, ladies, ovulating only once every 1,000 years or even having a period
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.800]   once every 1,000 years?
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:34.040]   That would be a blessing by any standard.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.600]   But now that death and because of the curse has entered into their existence, the human
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:48.360]   race would quickly go out of existence unless the birthing rate is greatly accelerated.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.160]   And you notice what verse 16 says, "I will greatly multiply your pain," and then it should
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.400]   say, "and your childbirth."
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.880]   Both.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:05.760]   Multiplied pain and multiplied childbirth.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.720]   Why?
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:19.720]   Because, well, humanity would quickly die.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:26.200]   Many of us know literally for centuries husbands and wives would have 10, 20 children and half
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.160]   of them would die before the age of six because of death.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:38.400]   Some of them would die in utero and that still occurs today.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.360]   In fact, our own daughter lost a child, her first child.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:47.600]   And then later on this afternoon, in just about 10 minutes, the doctor's going to be
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:54.280]   inducing her first hopefully live child.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:05.000]   So God says he has greatly increased, and it's interesting that along with this increased
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:13.600]   childbirth also comes a lot of the woman's physical problems.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.240]   A lot of the difficulties and a lot of the cancers and stuff that are associated with
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.600]   this, which is under the curse that ultimately brings about death, is now associated with
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:30.160]   this as well.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:36.240]   Now with that understanding, then how do we handle the issue of birth control?
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.320]   Well, there are different positions on this.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:46.840]   There are some who say that any kind of birth control then is permissible.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   And so some have suggested that birth control really is a non-issue for the Christian, anything
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:28:00.440]   in any type is permissible because we have to control the population.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:11.720]   We have to be good stewards of the population.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.880]   Really loving Christians they would say would allow a couple to make the decision as they
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.800]   see fit.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.480]   So abort-efficient types of birth control are permissible because God doesn't instill
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.900]   independent personhood until after birth or until birth.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.940]   And that's the way that they would reason this.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:34.920]   Once a child is born, then independent personhood is now there.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.080]   That child is detached from its mother, now it's an independent living being.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:49.280]   Prior to that it is a growth, but up to this particular time it's nothing more than that.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.160]   But now that the child is born, now it's an independent person.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:29:00.640]   So even abort-efficient types of birth control are permissible in this particular case for
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.560]   Christians they would say.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.960]   Then in a sense you can go to the other extreme and you can find people at different points
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.520]   along this continuum.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.600]   But the other extreme would be the no birth control is permissible position.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.920]   They would say anything that inhibits the natural procreative process in an attempt
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:29.680]   to preempt God and His will for your life is not permissible for the Christian.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   The cultural mandate is Genesis 1:28, it's to be obeyed and actually they would say is
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:47.360]   disobeyed and circumvented when any type of birth control is used.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:53.200]   Even the rhythm method.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:30:02.600]   Man ends up playing God in preventing conception they would say.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:07.680]   So you've got one side that says any kind of birth control is permissible and there
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   are Christians who advocate that position.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.480]   There aren't many, but they are.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:17.440]   And then there is the other side that says no birth control is permissible and far more
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.240]   Christians or at least people historically that label themselves as Christians are in
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.200]   that camp.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.280]   It's interesting from a historical point of view the Roman Catholic Church started doing
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   that because back in the Middle Ages Roman Catholicism was beginning to die out because
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.280]   of the Crusades.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:40.320]   All the men were going off to war and dying.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.560]   So the Pope and the Cardinals had to get together and figure out how they were going to reproduce
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.820]   the church and so they started advocating that any kind of birth control or birth control
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:53.920]   methods is forbidden so they would have more kids so the church could continue to grow
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:01.160]   even though the Crusades were still going on.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:10.840]   Then there is fourthly a position that says the only non-abortificient birth control.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:14.880]   Birth control drugs and devices that attempt to interrupt a bona fide pregnancy destroys
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:24.360]   a child like inner uterine devices, IUDs, morning after pills and patches.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:31.280]   Genesis 3.16 in this position clearly establishes the fact that man would struggle with multiplied
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:37.440]   pregnancies as he would with other consequences of the fall.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:47.120]   In other words there would be a strain on resources due to scarcity because of the fall.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.400]   That's part of the curse.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:56.880]   To be consistent then forbidding birth control would also necessitate forbidding all other
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:03.320]   efforts to combat the effects of the fall like disease and weeds and pestilence.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:16.840]   Anytime you take medicine attempts to affect or negate the effects of the fall.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:26.680]   So to me this fourth position I believe is a very biblical position.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:32.120]   If you forbid birth control on the one hand then you're going to have to be consistent
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.080]   with all the other effects of the fall.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.480]   You've got to forbid taking medicine.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.200]   You've got to forbid weeding your garden.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.320]   You've got to forbid any kind of control of pestilence.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:49.320]   So let pestilence run rampant throughout the earth and destroy crops.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:33:00.440]   Birth control is a means by which man now tries to be a good steward over his environment
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.840]   with limited resources.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:08.040]   But the fact that man has the capacity now to reproduce almost at any time is a way to
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:13.180]   keep the human race alive.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:20.560]   Now does this imply then that children are not really a blessing?
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.060]   That they're really an evidence of the curse?
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.960]   No it doesn't imply that at all.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.360]   They're still a blessing.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.880]   They're not the result of the curse but the frequency that children could come into the
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:41.600]   world groaning under the curse becomes a significant strain on man and his resources.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.240]   The ultimate result of the curse then is man laboring against death.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:51.280]   For centuries we know families who would have multiple children, 10 or 15 or more, and half
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.220]   or more of them would die before the age of six.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:34:06.180]   Now man is forced to make stewardship decisions in the shadow of the curse that has to happen.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.780]   Now I wish we had more time to cover some of that but Ruben, question?
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:29.180]   I was talking with a guy about this very issue and he was holding the first view, no, the
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.180]   second view, no birth control at all.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.180]   Yes.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   And he was claiming, well, first the blessing of God in Genesis 1 and 28 was under that
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.180]   blessing there are three commands and the same-
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.180]   And through four multiple I fill the earth.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:36.180]   In Genesis 9 because he was saying that, well, most people argue that after the fall of the
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:42.020]   two kings, that's like the fourth view, but then why in Genesis 9 to no one is given the
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.020]   same command?
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   And so he wasn't approaching birth control as controlling the result of sin but he's
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:59.100]   following that command because then humankind somehow still tries to obey that command because
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:04.900]   we still try to submit the nature in one sense.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:10.780]   And actually if I were to repeat your question or your statement, here's a guy who was arguing
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:14.980]   with you about the fact he was taking the position that you should use no birth control
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:15.980]   whatsoever.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:23.740]   And he was arguing in Genesis 1, 28 and 29 where it talks about the issue of, it gives
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:27.580]   the cultural mandate, be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it.
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:32.700]   And he says then after the curse we see even Noah later on is supposed to turn around and
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:36.340]   do the same thing in terms of populating the earth.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:41.980]   Well, you got to understand Genesis 1, 28 was given in an idealistic environment.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.860]   There was no sin, there was no curse at that particular time.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.580]   Man could have taken centuries, millennia to fill the earth.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:50.980]   No time limit was ever put on that.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:55.100]   But once the curse came, now we're severely limited.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:04.980]   Our lifetimes are now shortened from that of forever to only a few dozen years.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:09.600]   So now man's existence is not going to go on forever.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:17.460]   He's going to be during those years plagued with death and sickness, disease.
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.540]   He's going to be plagued by scarcity, by pestilence.
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:25.540]   All those things are going to be the case.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:33.580]   So when there's just a few people, they can afford to reproduce as quickly and as rapidly
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.660]   as possible with a lot of those babies dying.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.980]   That's okay.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:43.580]   Once you get to a point where you're reproducing beyond your ability to be able to support
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:48.900]   those children or supply for them because of the curse and scarcity, now it becomes
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:54.740]   a stewardship judgment.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:00.220]   And I would say that a person who takes that particular position doesn't take Genesis 3:16
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:05.180]   seriously or doesn't take the curse seriously.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:10.860]   And if he's going to be consistent with his position, then he, as I said, he's going to
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:17.740]   have to forbid any kind of resistance of the curse because birth control is dealing with
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:18.740]   that.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:26.580]   It's dealing with trying to be a good steward of the resources and health that God has given
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:29.060]   us.
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.060]   For example, I love kids.
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.900]   I can't wait until my granddaughter is born, all right?
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:35.900]   Can't wait.
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:36.900]   I love kids.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.900]   I could have had a dozen of them.
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.740]   I could have had 20 of them.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:46.140]   But after we had our first two kids and then we had twin boys and I saw what it did to
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:54.860]   my wife's body to do that, then we decided as a couple that's it with the kids, all right?
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:02.220]   Because I think I had a good stewardship responsibility as a husband in regards to her health.
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.080]   I have a good stewardship responsibility as a husband in regards to caring for the children
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.860]   that God has given me.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:15.080]   When I have multiple, large number of children, what really ends up happening is somebody
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.260]   else ends up taking care of those kids and somebody else ends up supporting those kids,
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:24.260]   the church, the state.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:33.940]   The guy doesn't and that's his responsibility to do that.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:34.940]   Other questions?
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:39.340]   By the way, not just questions on this but also questions about the sexual relationship
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.340]   and marriage.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.380]   I didn't cover any of those.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:50.520]   For instance, some people ask questions about the issue of oral sex in marriage and in marital
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   counseling.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.920]   I talk a little bit about that.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.460]   There's nothing in Scripture whatsoever that forbids it.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.540]   However, there's that overriding principle, that principle number three that we talked
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.620]   about.
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:05.220]   That is our goal here is not self-satisfaction but satisfaction of whom?
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.220]   Spouse.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:10.800]   So anything that's going to be repugnant to our spouse is not something that we're going
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:14.420]   to practice, right?
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:17.140]   Anything that's going to be repugnant to our spouse is not something that we're going to
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.220]   practice.
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:23.340]   There's the guide.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:30.140]   What about other, using other objects or I had a Christian couple come in.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.460]   They've been married for several years.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:37.700]   They had a good relationship with each other but they wanted to make their relationship
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.140]   more exciting and they suggested, "Listen.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:48.480]   Would it be good for us to watch some quasi-pornographic movies to enliven our sexual relationship?"
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:56.040]   Well, when that happens and somebody watches that, who are they ultimately having sex with?
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:57.040]   Their spouse?
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.980]   No, they're not.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:06.640]   They're having sex with the person in that movie, which basically says, "My spouse doesn't
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:17.040]   have everything I need for my satisfaction at all," or, "I don't have everything I need
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.120]   for my spouse's satisfaction.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:26.600]   I need to bring in something from the outside into our marriage in order to make this work."
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.360]   In that particular case, it would not be a biblical alternative to introduce into the
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:37.360]   Christian marriage.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   Other questions?
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360]   Victoria?
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]   If you're just counseling one person, say if I'm counseling a woman and she comes in
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   concerned about their physical intimacy saying that he has no interest in satisfying her,
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360]   then do you send her away saying that you just need to worry about your husband's satisfaction
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:41:00.920]   or is there a way to facilitate that?
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:07.640]   No, you need to train her to fulfill her biblical responsibility that if she has a husband that's
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:13.840]   not interested in satisfying her and you're counseling a woman, then you need to train
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:20.160]   her to do everything she can to satisfy her spouse and God will take care of her.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.080]   God will see to it that her basic needs are met.
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.120]   I've often said this to single people that I've counseled as well as sometimes marital
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.840]   couples like you have a husband or wife who is a Christian and their spouse is not a Christian
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:39.720]   and they sexually tease them but they're not interested in fulfilling that.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:45.520]   Well, the bottom line is nobody ever died without sex.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.240]   Nobody ever died without it.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.760]   In the history of the planet, that's never been the case.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.200]   So they're not going to die without it.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:57.400]   It may be something that's a big desire on their part but they're not going to.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.600]   They have to learn biblical self-control, focus on the responsibilities that God has
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.480]   given them and then let God work.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:13.800]   Usually when you do good, this is what 1 Peter 3 says, "When you do good to unbelievers,
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.960]   usually they will want to do good back to you."
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.800]   That isn't true all the time but usually that's the general rule.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.500]   And so if she's doing good to her husband even though he may even be a professing Christian
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:34.360]   but he's acting like an unbeliever because he doesn't want to fulfill her sexual desires,
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:41.000]   then it'll make it easy for him to want to do likewise with her.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.280]   And by the way, God has created her in such a way as well as him that he finds a certain
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.920]   amount of enjoyment in satisfying her and she finds a certain amount of enjoyment in
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.400]   satisfying him.
