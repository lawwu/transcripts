[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   I was going to ask you whether or not it's important to be happy in order to create,
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.380]   but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy were still able to create.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.280]   But the more I listen to you, it seems that it's really about an ability to pay attention.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.320]   So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy, may not be as relevant as whether or not I'm able
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.720]   to stay undistracted.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.720]   Yes, I would say being able to stay present in the work is probably the most important
