[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Hi Kel, my name is Taimoor. I am a software engineer by profession and I've been following your books for quite a long time now.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   My question is regarding your time block planner. I was wondering if you were to update, you are going to update to a new version with a spiral binding
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   because I read a lot of reviews on Amazon that the spiral binding would make it even more easy to use.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Do you have more updates coming to your time block planner soon? Please keep me updated. Thank you.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Good question, timely question. So we have a collection of changes that we are preparing for the next generation of time block planners.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Full life flat or significantly improved life flat is part of it. There's some changes I'm doing to the actual configuration of the pages inside the planner.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's going to give us more days worth of planning without having to actually make the planner much thicker.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   There's a few other things too that are on this list I've been working with my publisher on to get ready for the next generation of time block planners.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Here is the main thing that stands between us right now and generation two of the time block planners is that we printed a lot of the first generation.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We printed tens of thousands of copies of this planner. Now we've also sold tens of thousands of copies of the planner so it's good.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We're catching up to the supply, but we can't put out a new generation of the planner until we basically have moved through the first generation that we've already printed.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So what I want to try to tell people who are using a time block planner now, this thing will continually be updated.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   The slowest update is going to be this first one because the first printing of anything is going to be the biggest.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   After this first printing, printings will probably be smaller so we can get changes into the pipeline quicker.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   But you are not investing when you buy this planner, when you start doing time block planning,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   you're not investing in the exact version of the planner you receive in the mail as being what you will be using from here on out.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Over time, this planner will evolve based on feedback.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So you're investing in a system. You're investing in an approach to managing your time, not just a physical product.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Because once you fill that one planner, you get another one, and then you get another one.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And then the next one might be different because we're going to continue to evolve.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So I do like to tell people that, you know, every three months you're done with one.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Pretty soon the next one you get might be different.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So this seems very self-serving, but it's true.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The best thing you can do to help introduce or accelerate improvements to the planner is actually to keep using the planner.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So if you're using time block planning, and maybe there's some changes you want to see,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   keep using time block planning because if everyone bought one more, we get through six months more,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and everyone's bought two more, that's going to get us all the more quicker to the printing selling out
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   so we can get the new changes into the pipeline.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So again, I know that sounds really self-serving, but this is the bigger point I want to make is
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   when you buy the time block planner, it's not the one thing you get.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It is an investment in a new philosophy of scheduling.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And if you don't know what we're talking about, we do have that website, timeblockplanner.com,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   which explains what time blocking is.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We have a really nice video there that actually shows the planner in action, etc.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So yes, changes are coming.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   After those changes, there'll be more, and after those, there will, I'm sure, be more.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   This will continue to evolve.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Keep your feedback on this planner coming to me, and together we are going to make the tools we use
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   for this really effective mode of time management increasingly polished and increasingly useful.
