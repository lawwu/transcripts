[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.960]   (music)
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.160]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound, live from New York.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160]   I'm in the same room for the first time in a while.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.760]   We've got 40 other people going through our Google Docs this week.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760]   A lot of good questions.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.760]   I'm appreciative of the thought and effort that goes into these.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000]   I feel like a lot of the questions are similar in nature,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   but they're always different from the unique circumstances.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So we really appreciate it.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Keep them coming at thecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.760]   I finally got the Bird Dog Polo.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.500]   And it is muggy as all getup in Manhattan right now.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.260]   We just walked from lunch and just sweating and hot.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.660]   And this shirt is comfy.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.660]   It's breathable.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.660]   It's active.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.660]   It's got the stretch material just like the shorts.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.660]   It's stylish.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660]   I'd say good for golf, but I don't golf.
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660]   It's an active -- maybe a dinner date if you want to wear a
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.660]   collar in the summer.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660]   And if you go to birddogs.com/atc,
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660]   you get a free white tech hat.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.660]   I don't have one because I was wearing it all weekend last week.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.660]   I'm not a big hat guy.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.660]   I used to wear more hats in college,
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.660]   but it was like backwards frat bro hats.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660]   Nice.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660]   And then I become a dad, and the rule is you cannot wear your hat
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.660]   backwards if you're a dad.
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660]   Is that a rule?
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.660]   I don't know.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.660]   I don't make them.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.660]   That's the rules.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660]   So I'm not a big hat guy.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.660]   You got to have a little more fun.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.660]   You got to wear a hat backwards.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.660]   You got to play golf.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.660]   And you got to drink coffee.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.660]   You could do it when you're doing a good shot, Duncan,
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660]   like you turn the hat backwards.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.660]   Sure.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.660]   So that's just alone and over the top.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.660]   Birddogs.com/atc, and you get a free tech hat.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660]   Check out the new polos.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660]   They've got a bunch of different colors.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660]   And, of course, the shorts, as always.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660]   Before we get into the questions,
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.660]   got a feedback from last week.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660]   Someone was wondering why do target date funds not have --
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660]   how can you not get a 100% equity target date fund?
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660]   Jeff says, "The likely reason target date funds for most people
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660]   "retiring more than 40 years from now still maintain a small bond
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.660]   "position is because a fund with 100% equity position would not
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.660]   "qualify as a QDIA default fund in a retirement plan."
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.660]   I didn't know that.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.660]   Sounds right.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.660]   All right.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.660]   I'll take him for his word.
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.660]   All right.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.660]   First question.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.660]   Okay.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660]   Also, I'm sorry.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660]   I told you I was going to cue you when we were live.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660]   I didn't.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.660]   So everyone watched you for a couple of seconds.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660]   Sorry about that.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.660]   But, yeah, we're doing this live.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660]   Okay.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660]   Up first today, we have a question from Matt.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660]   "I'm 38, and for most of my adult life,
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.660]   "I made just enough to survive with nothing left to invest.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.660]   "Everything changed a few years ago.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   "My salary increased from $35,000 to $140,000 over four years.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660]   "At first, I spent everything.
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.660]   "For the last two years, I've done the opposite.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.660]   "I save everything.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.660]   "My monthly expenses, including mortgage, are less than $1,000,
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.660]   "and my after-tax savings rate is 80% to 90%.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.660]   "In the last two years, I've saved about $150,000,
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.660]   "not including maxing my 401(k) and Roth.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.660]   "My job isn't going anywhere, but I have a constant fear that
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.660]   "something is going to happen and everything will be ripped away.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.660]   "The key thing is that I have no real skills,
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.660]   "but I hit the lottery at a company that has rewarded me
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660]   "for a decade of hard work.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   "Most financial experts would probably say I'm saving too much,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.660]   "but what do you think my situation justifies
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.660]   "regarding savings rate?"
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.660]   Not hyperbole here.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660]   I think this is one of the favorite questions that we've ever gotten.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.660]   Because we've got this question before about,
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660]   "Hey, I save too much, what do I do?"
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.660]   But this question just shows how it's way more about mind
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.660]   than money for a lot of people.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.660]   And also, I'm very glad I'm wearing the bird dog shirt,
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660]   because it's hot in here, Duncan.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.660]   It is. I turned my AC off.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.660]   That's okay. Got to go for the good sound.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.660]   So I think a lot of the questions we receive are similar
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660]   from a financial perspective, as I mentioned,
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.660]   but the circumstances are different.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.660]   And this person has their own type of money trauma.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   So first of all, I say don't sell yourself short here, Matt.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.660]   You do have a real skill. You work hard.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   And obviously, your company likes that,
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.660]   because they gave you a four-times raise in four years.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.660]   You're obviously doing something right.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.660]   Yeah, I find that refreshing, instead of the typical,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.660]   "Oh, I just out-hustled everyone else."
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.660]   To be like, "I don't have any skills. I'm lucky," basically.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660]   Yeah, I do appreciate them being humble
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.660]   and having some self-awareness,
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.660]   but give yourself a little credit.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.660]   You obviously do something right that your company values that.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.660]   So I understand the trepidation for the spending, right?
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.660]   The lottery minds that I think can bring conflicting emotions.
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.660]   So most people spend their entire career,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660]   they slowly and methodically build up their income
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.660]   and their savings, and the wealth doesn't come all at once.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.660]   So I think one of the reasons so many lottery winners end up broke
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.660]   is because it's not normal to experience this abrupt change in your wealth.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.660]   So my favorite lottery anecdote, Duncan,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660]   every year, Americans spend more money on the lottery
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.660]   than they do on movie tickets, music, professional sporting events,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.660]   video games, and books combined,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   which is why it's always on the news, I guess.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.660]   I actually researched the psychology of winning the lottery
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.660]   for my book, "Don't Fall For It,"
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.660]   and they said one-third of all lottery winners end up bankrupt,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.660]   declaring bankruptcy.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.660]   And even the neighbors of people who win the lottery
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.660]   are more likely to declare bankruptcy than average,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.660]   like the herd mentality kind of thing.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   So I think that first reaction of Matt--
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.660]   You seem like a big lottery person.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.660]   I doubt I've ever played in my life.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.660]   I got scratch-off tickets for Christmas.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.660]   I used to be big into scratch-offs. That was fun.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660]   I don't know. I'm not a big fan.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.660]   So I think that first reaction of his to spend everything he had made sense.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.660]   But I think it's also understandable why he has the opposite extreme of,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.660]   "I went from $35K to $140K.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.660]   "I have this memory of making a much lower income.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.660]   "What if it is all taken away from me?"
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.660]   So I think it makes sense that he whipsawed back to the other extreme.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.660]   The good news is that he already has the ability to cut back.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.660]   An after-tax savings rate of 80-90% would make Mr. Money Mustache blush.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.660]   He's living on less than $12K a year, which is crazy.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660]   I think most of the flier people say $25K a year
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.660]   is what you should shoot for.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.660]   So even if that biggest fear is realized
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.660]   and that new six-figure income is gone,
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.660]   you've already given yourself a margin of safety,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.660]   a savings rate combined with a low burn rate.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.660]   Most people can barely handle one, let alone both of those.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.660]   Think about it. If he's got $150K sitting in a taxable account,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.660]   that's, what, 13 years of current lifestyle expenses?
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.660]   If we include those 401(k) and Roth IRA max contributions,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.660]   we're talking 18 years of living expenses.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.660]   He's in fantastic shape financially, so he knows how to cut back.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.660]   I think if he decided to give himself a little raise,
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.660]   he could double or triple his spending
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.660]   and still be well on the way to financial freedom.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.660]   The only way he's truly going to be comfortable
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.660]   spending a little more money
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.660]   is by tapping into the feelings and emotions about money.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.660]   It's always about trade-offs,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.660]   and I think the biggest regret he's concerned about right now
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.660]   is what happens if this higher income goes away.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.660]   But he also has to think about the regret you might feel
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.660]   if that extreme frugality makes you miss out on life.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.660]   John, throw up this comment from Ramit on Twitter this week.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.660]   He shared this Reddit comment,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   and it basically is someone who says,
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.660]   "Hey, I reached my fire number,
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.660]   "but I had this unhealthy fixation with money,
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.660]   "and I feel like I've missed out on life."
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.660]   So that's a regret, too.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.660]   I think some people have this unhealthy fixation with spending,
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   some people it's over-saving.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.660]   I think we all have our own issues. No one's perfect in these things.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.660]   But I think if we're looking at a psychological solution here,
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.660]   instead of going cold turkey and saying,
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.660]   "I'm going from 80% to 90% savings rate
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.660]   "down to 30% or 40% or 20% or whatever is more reasonable,"
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.660]   I would say instead of ripping the band-aid off,
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.660]   do it in a stair-step approach.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.660]   Do 5% each paycheck or each month or each quarter or something,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   and slowly work yourself down and give yourself a slow raise
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.660]   so it's not going back the other way where you're spending a ton.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.660]   But I also think you have to figure out
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660]   what makes you happy prioritized in terms of spending.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.660]   I think you have to pick a few categories.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   It can be anything, really-- going out to eat
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.660]   or going to a concert or buying clothes or shoes.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.660]   Whatever brings you joy, and spend on those things without worry.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.660]   Studies show that experiences and building relationships
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.660]   gives you the biggest bang for your buck.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   But even if you want to spend it on material goods, I don't care.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   I think the fact that you are such a good saver,
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   you probably just want to budget for it ahead of time.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.660]   Put aside a set amount or a set percentage
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   and say, "This is my worry-free money. I'm going to spend it."
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.660]   Spending money on yourself doesn't bring fulfillment
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.660]   because you already tried that.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.660]   I don't know, take your friends out for drinks every once in a while
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.660]   and buy a round, or take your family out to dinner once a month
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.660]   and pick up the tab.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.660]   I think you just don't want to be living
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.660]   in that constant financial fetal position.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.660]   At a certain point, you have to enjoy it a little bit.
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.660]   But you're doing great, so cut yourself some slack
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.660]   and enjoy some of your money.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.660]   It sounds like they've got some imposter syndrome maybe going on too.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.660]   Like you were saying, they obviously have some skills.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.660]   They're being paid a lot of money.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.660]   There's something going on there.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.660]   Don't sell yourself too short.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.660]   If it doesn't last, then you want to enjoy it while it's here.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.660]   I think you've already put yourself in a good position.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.660]   You're doing good.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.660]   Alright, another one.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.660]   Up next, we have a question from Colin.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.660]   "I've always wanted to start a podcast,
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.660]   but the reality is that 90% of podcasts don't make it.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.660]   I was fearful I wouldn't be able to keep up
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.660]   the pace of producing content
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   and was hesitant to make the commitment.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.660]   To overcome this, I started a podcast with my dad.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.660]   We have zero expectations
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.660]   and are just trying to get some reps in.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.660]   We meet once a week at the local library,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.660]   use their recording equipment, and talk for an hour or so.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.660]   We've tested different segments and topics
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.660]   and are trying to improve each episode.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.660]   Our goal is to reach 100 episodes,
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   and we're currently at 15.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.660]   Worst case scenario, I spend an hour each week
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.660]   chatting with my father while learning a new skill.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.660]   Are there any specific processes,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.660]   habits, or strategies you've implemented
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.660]   that significantly improve your podcasting skills?"
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.660]   Alright, well, let's bring my fellow podcast host in here,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.660]   who's got a great-looking shirt on.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.660]   First of all, I didn't know
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.660]   that you could go to a library and do podcasts.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.660]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.660]   I think a library isn't going to put you out of business,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.660]   because if they have equipment there at the library,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.660]   I did not realize that.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.660]   It's true. All you need is the equipment.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.660]   Michael, we probably shared our story a few times
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.660]   and that's your thing.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.660]   - Two things. - Comes in ready, coming hot.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.660]   One, how great do we look and feel?
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.660]   It's pretty nice.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.660]   Actually, my friend came over the other day and saw this
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   and said, "Let me feel that." Nice shirt. Great shirt.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.660]   You guys should match more often.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.660]   Number two, and this is a segue into what we're talking about.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.660]   I want to pat you on the shoulder,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.660]   on the head, on the back.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.660]   You've gotten really good at this. I'm proud of you.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.660]   It's not easy, right?
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.660]   Well, that was part of the thing with us, Randall Spirits.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.660]   We froze.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.660]   We didn't know what to do.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.660]   Colin's question here.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.660]   A little behind the curtain.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.660]   We probably told this story before,
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.660]   but Ben and I, when we first started the podcast,
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.660]   I think our strategy was to turn blog posts into a podcast.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.660]   It was a script. We were reading on a script.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.660]   God, it was bad.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.660]   All the best podcasts are read from a script.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.660]   There's some people in life that are just naturally good at certain things,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.660]   but for the rest of us, you have to put in the reps.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.660]   I think the fact that he's doing that is good.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.660]   I do like the idea of low expectations
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.660]   in terms of building an audience.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   We spent years building a blog audience
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.660]   before we ever started a podcast,
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.660]   so we had a little bit of a built-in base.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.660]   I think your worst-case scenario
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.660]   of you're spending some quality time with your father
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.660]   and you have these recordings that you could potentially go back to
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.660]   years later and share them with the family,
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.660]   I think that's just a good starting point.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   I would just keep the expectations low.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   He asked if there's anything that we would recommend
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   for him to improve his skills.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.660]   There's no substitute for reps.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.660]   Talking, as silly as it sounds,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.660]   there's a big difference between
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   shooting the breeze with your friends
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   and talking into a microphone
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.660]   where you have to be coherent, where there's the light on.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.660]   It's a lot of pressure.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.660]   I have a lot more respect for DJs.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.660]   Yeah, it's hard. It's difficult.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.660]   So there's nothing that can replace reps,
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.660]   whether it's podcasting
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.660]   or any other walk of life.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.660]   One specific thing that I can give advice on
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.660]   that helped us a lot,
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.660]   and I think we did this pretty early,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   was even though we don't have anything written out
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   as far as, "Okay, when this happens, say this,"
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.660]   or "Segue to this,"
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.660]   we don't do any of that, but we have a Google Doc.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.660]   And so we have topics, and we have articles,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.660]   and quotes, tweets, whatever it is.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.660]   Yeah, there's a structure.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.660]   So there's a structure to the show,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.660]   so we're not just completely rambling.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.660]   I think that the most important thing
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.660]   is to keep your expectations low.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.660]   You're getting an hour with your father,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.660]   which you probably wouldn't have otherwise,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.660]   which is a beautiful thing.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.660]   And I encourage the hell out of this.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.660]   Will anything come out of it? Who knows?
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.660]   But I like Patrick Arshonis's mantra
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.660]   of growth without goals.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.660]   You do something for the sake of doing it.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   You don't know where it's going to go,
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.660]   and you see where it takes you.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.660]   And I would talk about stuff you're interested in,
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.660]   because if you're doing content about stuff
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.660]   you don't care about, then that's going to come off.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   So do the stuff you're interested in.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660]   You have to enjoy it, too.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.660]   Right, that's part of what makes all of our shows work,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.660]   is that I think people can tell
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.660]   that you guys really enjoy it,
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.660]   and that you're doing it because you want to.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.660]   We were basically doing this show with each other
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.660]   on the phone before we ever hit record.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.660]   Love it.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.660]   So we started this in November 2017.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.660]   It's been almost six years.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.660]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.660]   I mean, we've been doing this a long time.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.660]   All right, we've got a question
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.660]   from the Animal Spirits mailbag, actually,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.660]   for the next one.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.660]   Okay.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.660]   I love this question.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.660]   Oh, one other piece of advice
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.660]   I wanted to give the podcast person, though.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.660]   Treat things like they're live.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.660]   What I see too many people rely on
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.660]   is they just say, like, "Oh, we'll fix in post.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.660]   "We'll edit. We'll do this or that."
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.660]   You'll do so much better if you treat things--
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.660]   I was on a podcast--
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.660]   Do we see somebody--
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.660]   I was on a podcast with someone,
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660]   and every two minutes, he'd go,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.660]   "Three, two, one, start over,"
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660]   and I'd be like, "Whoa, I can't--"
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.660]   No, yeah, that's a recipe to have a really, like, disjointed,
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.660]   like, not a very free-flowing, nice podcast.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.660]   Duncan, credit to all of us.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.660]   How often would you say that we say, "Start over"?
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.660]   I would say never.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.660]   Almost never.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660]   Because we want it to be more natural.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   Because I would just weave it in.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.660]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.660]   [laughter]
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.660]   No, there's been some times where, you know,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.660]   I might have crossed the line, but other than that--
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.660]   No, never.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.660]   Okay.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.660]   Cool.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.660]   Up next.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.660]   But yes, you're a professional, and we never have to edit.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.660]   Not to brag. Thank you, Duncan.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.660]   Okay.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.660]   This is my favorite question this week.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.660]   Question three is from Dan,
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.660]   but maybe I shouldn't have named him
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.660]   because his friends are going to be hitting him up
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.660]   if they see this.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.660]   "I'm the commissioner of a fantasy football league,
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.660]   "and every year, I get $1,300 from the rest of the league
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.660]   "that just sits in a Venmo account
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.660]   "waiting for whoever wins the league.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.660]   "I've decided that this seems like a waste of capital.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.660]   "Should I invest it in a six-month CD,
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.660]   "get like $30, and reduce my share of the pot to $70?
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.660]   "Or should I gamble everything and invest it into crypto,
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.660]   "knowing that I'll have to make up any difference
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.660]   "at the end of the season?"
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.660]   I love this question just because the other people in the league
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.660]   will be so pissed off if they knew he was thinking about this.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.660]   Nine-month targeted fund.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.660]   I'm usually not a fan of speculation,
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.660]   but I want this guy to YOLO this just to see what happens.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.660]   Because he already said he knows, like,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.660]   "Listen, I'll have to make up the difference if I lose some money."
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.660]   I think he kind of has to do it now.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.660]   Not financial advice. What do you got?
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.660]   What's on your mind?
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   What are you bullish on these days?
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.660]   You're the one who's trying to bottom pick all the time.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.660]   What are you putting your money in these days?
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.660]   Uh...
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.660]   I mean, come on, that's so tough.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.660]   I know, but I like the idea,
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.660]   and I think that should be part of the fantasy league going forward,
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.660]   that everyone who holds the money has--
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.660]   like, the winner has to do this each year.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.660]   And if they lose, they have to make--
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   if they lose, the league has to make up the difference.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.660]   Wait, that's a great idea.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.660]   Have everyone involved.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.660]   Whoever's in last place at the end of the year
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.660]   has to make up the difference if there's a loss.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.660]   Well, that could work.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.660]   But also, how about each person involved in the league
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.660]   gets to pick a stock,
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.660]   they put it in a portfolio for the season,
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   and they see how they did.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.660]   Winner takes the-- I don't know.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.660]   I like it.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.660]   The real answer is do not gamble this money away.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.660]   I mean, come on.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.660]   But the fun answer is--
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.660]   no, just come on.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.660]   The real answer is don't tell anyone about your fantasy football team
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.660]   because no one cares.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.660]   That's the real answer.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.660]   Well, also, I like that their options are a CD or crypto.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.660]   There's nothing in between.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   I would do NVIDIA puts weeklies and just keep rolling them.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.660]   Oh my god.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.660]   All right.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.660]   Michael.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.660]   Am I out of here?
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.660]   All right, well done.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.660]   Thank you for having me.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.660]   That was fun.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.660]   Yeah, thanks, Michael.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.660]   Next question.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.660]   Okay, up next we have a question from Steven.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.660]   I max out my pre-tax 401(k) and Roth IRA every year.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   I now have access to a Roth 401(k).
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   If I move to a Roth 401(k), I'll take a big hit on taxes
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.660]   and miss the tax deduction every year moving forward.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   I have a decent pension coming to me when I retire in 25 years.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.660]   It should cover my monthly expenses such as utilities and a mortgage.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.660]   With that, the Roth IRA and Social Security,
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   I won't make withdrawals until I'm forced to take RMDs in my 70s.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   I don't want to save too much money now and enjoy life less while I'm young.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   Am I thinking too much about today and hurting my future a little bit
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.660]   if I don't convert to a Roth 401(k)?
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.660]   All right, I'm surrounded by tax bills here.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.660]   Our two tax experts at Ritholtz Wealth, Bill Sweet and Bill Alceronian.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   We get a lot of questions about Roth 401(k)s lately,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   and I think people do try to think of the Roth.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.660]   The people who get this far and have this detailed question are thinking like,
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.660]   "Do I really want the benefit in the future or do I want it now?"
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.660]   What say you? We'll start with Mr. Sweet since he's been here longer.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.660]   First, can I ask, who's playing the role of Michael now that Michael's left?
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.660]   Is it me or Bill?
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.660]   That's you.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.660]   That's me, okay.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.660]   So I'm going to Josh Spen about something silly.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.660]   But notice, too, that tax guys don't get cool shirts.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.660]   So kids, when you're out there picking careers--
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.660]   Well, you guys have the real collars on.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.660]   Right.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.660]   But no, I think Bill Alceronian is going to take this one.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   I do have a quick question, like why do we need to think about converting?
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.660]   That would be my question.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   But, Bill, your take on this.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.660]   Unfortunately, we're not going to first take this,
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   and Bill Sweet and myself are not going to go back and forth debating why.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.660]   We're generally--
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.660]   So you're saying they're thinking about this question wrong, potentially.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.660]   Well, I think so.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.660]   There's no need for a conversion in this case
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.660]   because it sounds like this individual might have access to a Roth 401(k).
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.660]   They can make direct contributions to the Roth 401(k) in lieu of a conversion.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.660]   They noted that they are eligible for a Roth IRA contribution,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   so that tells me that their income cannot be more than the 24% tax bracket.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.660]   And a 24%--Bill, I think you showed a chart a few weeks ago--
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.660]   that 24%, it's kind of up in the air.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   Like, does a Roth conversion make sense?
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.660]   In this case, you can make the contribution instead of a conversion.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   You don't have to worry about paying the tax out of pocket.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.660]   It's all going through your paycheck.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.660]   And when it goes through the paycheck, you're less inclined to think about the tax bill.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.660]   Amen.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.660]   And my take on it is, look, Roth IRA, 401(k), you say it's maxing out a 401(k).
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   We're doing a Roth IRA each year.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.660]   That's $29,000 in 2023.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.660]   So a pretty good saver here.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.660]   That's a great savings rate.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.660]   And if you're going to do that over 25 years, that's $725,000 of contributions.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.660]   If you're lucky, you get roughly 7% annualized return.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.660]   That's $2.1 million of annual Roth assets at the end,
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.660]   and that's going to support 4% rule, about $80,000 of spending a year.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.660]   My take is, exactly like you said, Bill, start contributing to the 401(k).
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.660]   Max that sucker out every year.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.660]   You're saving a lot.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.660]   If you can support a lifestyle on $80,000 in today's spending plus Social Security,
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.660]   I think you're winning the game.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.660]   I would focus on the balance.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   And this person has a pension also.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660]   You know that he has a pension.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.660]   He's 25 years from retirement.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   It sounds like Stephen here is going to be set up well.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.660]   So my point with Roth versus pre-tax, it doesn't have to be all or nothing.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.660]   You can split the difference as well.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.660]   And that's my big Ben Carlson takeaway from Asset Compound.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.660]   Live your life.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.660]   You can't take this money with you guys.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.660]   Right, especially with a pension as a fallback.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.660]   Amen.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.660]   Podcast with your dad or your Bill.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.660]   Duncan.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.660]   That's what Rihanna says, right?
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.660]   Live your life.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.660]   I thought it was Bon Jovi.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.660]   Okay.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.660]   Up next we have a question from Andrew.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.660]   I inherited an IRA back in April worth $106,000.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.660]   I'm 53 years old, married with two kids in college,
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.660]   and don't need to take my first minimum withdrawal until December 2024.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.660]   I don't need the money now, so what should I do?
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.660]   Withdraw it all now and take a tax hit and reinvest it in a new Roth?
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   We already have a 401(k) that we're way behind on.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.660]   Keep as is for the maximum 10 years and take the minimum withdrawal annually,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.660]   or should we take the final withdrawal at the 10-year mark,
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   which would be a large withdrawal, meaning a large tax bill?
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.660]   I think you talked about this one before, but I didn't realize this.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   So you inherit an IRA, the stopwatch starts,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.660]   and you have 10 years to divest of that money.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.660]   Does it have to be in, like, a certain amount each year,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.660]   or is it just by the end of 10 years it's gone?
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.660]   Funny you ask.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.660]   The IRS has not given us great guidance on this over the last couple years
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.660]   since some of the COVID tax changes.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.660]   If you inherit from a spouse, generally those rules haven't changed,
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.660]   and you can take distributions over the rest of your life
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   rather than the 10-year rule.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.660]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   So it's different if it's a parent?
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.660]   Correct.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.660]   And Andrew, sorry for your loss.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.660]   If you inherited an IRA, that means you lost somebody very close to you.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.660]   We're sorry to hear that.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.660]   I know Bill put together some visual for this one.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.660]   But the thing is, if you waited until the end of 10 years,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.660]   if you really thought that, and you happened to, like,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   take it all at an inopportune time,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.660]   then if you didn't dollar-cost average out or something, you're--
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   Well, that's the key question.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.660]   So Andrew gives us some hints.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.660]   There's two of them.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.660]   One is that he needs to do RMDs next year.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.660]   So it's actually, like, the worst of both worlds.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.660]   He needs to continue RMDs.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.660]   The rule there, Ben, is once you start an RMD,
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   if you pass that on to someone, the RMDs need to keep going.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.660]   Oh, so this person was over the age of--okay.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   And now 10-year, too, Andrew got whacked with the SECURE Act,
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.660]   meaning that by 2033 he's got to distribute 100% of the balance.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.660]   The clock's ticking.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.660]   So we did do some math here.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.660]   I hate to scare you guys.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.660]   John, can we pull up chart number 1, please?
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.660]   So what we're taking a look at here, if we take a look at the chart,
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.660]   is what the math looks like on a lump sum distribution
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.660]   on the left column versus an annual distribution.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.660]   Don't need to go too much into details.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.660]   You can hit pause or take a look at YouTube.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.660]   But under a lump sum distribution,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.660]   you end up with a larger account balance, about $201,000,
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.660]   versus doing annual contributions at roughly $12,000, $13,000 a year.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.660]   You can take a look.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.660]   If your goal is to minimize taxes,
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.660]   you're actually better off doing it annually,
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.660]   but if your goal is to increase your after-tax income,
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.660]   you actually want to wait and defer until the end,
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.660]   and that's making a couple assumptions.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.660]   When we did the math, me and Bill in the office,
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.660]   the difference in tax-equivalent rates needed to be more than about 12%,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.660]   meaning that your jump in that final year needed to be pretty large
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.660]   to get all the way to 37% versus the current rate.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.660]   And your big risk there would just be you wait to the end of 10 years,
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.660]   the market crashes, and you're not diversified enough,
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.660]   and then your account goes down and you lost all that benefit.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.660]   True, but it also depends on financial planning.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.660]   Once you take a distribution and you can reinvest the assets,
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.660]   that brings us up, John, to chart number two.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.660]   And so chart number two, the question Andrew asked is,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.660]   "Should I take a distribution and put that into a Roth?"
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.660]   Bill, can we do that? Can we just take an RMD and put it into a Roth?
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   No, at this dollar amount, even if the taxpayer has earned income,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   they can't make a direct Roth contribution north of $100,000.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.660]   What if they did the traditional and then backdoored it?
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660]   Can we not do that?
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.660]   No, I mean, we're talking six figures here,
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.660]   and there's no world in which they can put six figures into a Roth.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.660]   Over that amount, yeah, right.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.660]   Right, right.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.660]   So what we did, though, as a model here in chart two
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.660]   is what would happen, hypothetically, if we took the traditional IRA,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.660]   the inherited IRA distribution, invested the $7,500 max,
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.660]   because Andrew's 53, so he can make a catch-up contribution,
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660]   and what would happen to that Roth?
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.660]   You actually do outperform the lump sum option,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.660]   assuming a 6% flat rate of return, and obviously do better there.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   So that's actually an interesting option.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.660]   Assuming he's not contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA right now,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.660]   taking those distributions, reinvesting in the Roth,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.660]   he actually comes out ahead by about $12,000 in my analysis.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.660]   Is Rothification in the tax code?
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.660]   Rothification without representation
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.660]   is what we thought the Dawson P. Party thought.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.660]   Here's the real kicker, though--tax changes.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.660]   We don't know what's happening in the 2024 elections, future elections.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.660]   We could be subject to different tax rates in the short term and the long term,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.660]   and that is well outside of anything we can predict.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.660]   Right, so stretching out 10 years could be a good thing or a bad thing.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.660]   Yeah, we just don't know, and so that's why diversification
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.660]   actually probably is the right angle here.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.660]   All right, we've got one more question, Duncan.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.660]   Okay.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.660]   Last but not least, we have a question from Travis.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.660]   "My wife and I are 39.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.660]   "We're diligent savers in a variety of tax-deferred retirement accounts.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.660]   "My concern is that most of our nest egg will be in tax-protected accounts
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   "that are not meant to be used until 59 1/2.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.660]   "If we want to retire between 50 and 55,
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.660]   "should we contribute less to 401(k) and Roth now
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.660]   "and more to our taxable brokerage account?"
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.660]   Good question. I think a lot of--
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.660]   Yeah, this is a good one.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.660]   I shortened this question a little bit.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   Travis gave us some numbers.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.660]   They're doing very well.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.660]   We're at their stage in life, almost 40 years old.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660]   Good on you, Travis.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   They've got a lot of money saved.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   So I think this is something you have to think about
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.660]   in terms of diversification for retiring early.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   What are your thoughts here?
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.660]   Because I know you've talked in the past maybe about,
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   "Well, if you used a Roth, then you could take the contributions out,"
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.660]   but you have to think through what are the spending levels going to be
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   at that time in 15 or 16 years.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   Totally. Brings up Bill's point before.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.660]   But diversification, big principle.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   You do not want all your assets in a traditional.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.660]   You do not want them all in Roth.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.660]   And if you're planning on retirement, think about retiring in your 50s.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.660]   You probably don't want everything in a retirement account.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   I would think about an order of operations, right, Bill,
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.660]   is that ultimately there's a couple of different buckets you could go to
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.660]   if you retire at 52, 53.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.660]   First, you're looking at a 9-year time horizon,
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.660]   so you're not looking at a large time frame.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.660]   Second, skip all the way to the end, what's the worst-case scenario?
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.660]   You need to take a distribution from a traditional IRA.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.660]   What are you looking at if that's the case?
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.660]   In that first year?
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.660]   In any year before 55.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.660]   Oh, there's a 10% penalty--
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.660]   10% penalty.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.660]   --to distribute from an IRA early, before 55.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.660]   Are there any rules of thumb for asset location, too?
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660]   If they're in their taxable account,
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.660]   should they keep certain types of investments
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.660]   that they'll be using for spending purposes?
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.660]   Typically, if we're trying to bridge the gap between an early retirement
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.660]   and an IRA distribution age without penalties,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.660]   I think there's a case to be made to build up the taxable bucket,
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.660]   the brokerage bucket.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   And that bucket can bridge the gap between 50 and 59.5,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.660]   where they're not paying penalties.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.660]   And then at 59.5 and into the 60s, you have the IRA or the 401(k) money
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.660]   to draw on without the penalty.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.660]   Yep.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   And so ideally, if you're retiring,
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.660]   that means you don't have any earned income at that phase.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.660]   You're not eligible for Social Security until 62.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.660]   Filling up capital gains brackets at that point, to me,
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   would make a lot of sense,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.660]   because if you're under the 12% or lower tax rate,
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.660]   your capital gains bracket is actually zero.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.660]   Right.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660]   And so that, Ben, to answer your question,
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.660]   I would love to have some long-term capital gains built up at that point
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.660]   to start to realize it was tax-free.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.660]   There are other choices, though, Bill,
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.660]   and we could just cover a couple of them.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.660]   Number one is Rule 55.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.660]   Do you want to go down to that real quick?
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.660]   That's pretty easy.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   Rule of 55 says if you leave an employer at the age of 55,
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   before 59.5, before you can roll it into an IRA
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   and take penalty-free distributions,
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.660]   you can leave the assets in the 401(k)
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.660]   and take distributions from the 401(k) without penalty
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.660]   if you're over the age of 55.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.660]   It has to stay in the employer plan.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.660]   It has to be in the employer plan.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.660]   If it leaves the employer plan, you're out of luck.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.660]   You can't roll it over.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.660]   Correct.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660]   403(b) is also eligible.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.660]   403(b) is eligible.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.660]   And if you're a public safety employee,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.660]   a police officer, a fireman,
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.660]   you can do this at 50 instead of 55.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.660]   And if you happen to have a business,
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.660]   you could potentially roll assets
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.660]   into a self-employed 401(k), right?
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.660]   A little more technical,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.660]   but ultimately that could qualify, too.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.660]   The key point, Bill said it.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.660]   You have to be 55 or older when you leave service,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.660]   so you can't retire at 52 and then wait for three years.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   So many numbers.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.660]   This is why we have tax professionals,
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.660]   because there's 50, 55, 59.5,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.660]   which still never made sense to me.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.660]   I've got another one for you, 72(t).
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.660]   If you do hit 55, you can file a 72(t)
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   and ultimately take some penalty distributions
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.660]   on roughly, you annuitize.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.660]   We're switching from 401(k) to IRA.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.660]   Right, correct.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.660]   This is an IRA strategy.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.660]   Or to start, you just take the penalty, right,
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.660]   if you happen to have this issue.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.660]   And if you don't have a lot of income,
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.660]   maybe that's not a big deal.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.660]   But I think planning ahead, you're 39.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.660]   Travis, he's got 10 years to figure this out, 20 years.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.660]   I feel like if we're doing an average of,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.660]   when people say they want to retire early,
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   55 is always the number, is it not?
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.660]   It's a rule of 55 in the tax code, right?
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.660]   Doesn't it seem like it, though?
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.660]   When people say, "I want to retire early,"
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.660]   I mean, people are saying this in their 30s and 40s,
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.660]   and their life could always be completely different,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   which is, I think, to your guys' points
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.660]   about diversification.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.660]   But that seems like a number of people
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.660]   just pull out of the air and go, "55 sounds good."
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.660]   I think it all depends, right?
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.660]   In this career, in financial advice,
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   people never retire.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.660]   I mean, it's very rare to see that.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.660]   I'm on Team Never Retire.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.660]   I like being a useful, productive member of society.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.660]   But that said, I think it's more about choosing
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.660]   what you do, how you do it,
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.660]   and if you have a lot of assets, you can have options.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.660]   I think mid-30s is where a lot of people
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.660]   get kind of burned out and are like,
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.660]   "I think I can do this for another maybe 20 years."
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.660]   A lot of the early retirement questions
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.660]   come from people in, like, 35 to 40, right?
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660]   Travis, 39. Look at that.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.660]   And 20 years feels like a long time.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.660]   So it's like, "Okay, I can do this 20 more years."
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.660]   Yeah, kids are in college.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.660]   If you're in mid-30s, you have young kids,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.660]   you're like, "Oh, I'll get them through college,
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.660]   and I'll call it quits."
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.660]   That's true.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660]   Sounds good to me.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660]   Then you realize how much college costs,
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.660]   and you work for 10 more years.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.660]   There goes the retirement.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.660]   All right, I want to thank the Bills
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.660]   for their tax expertise, as always.
