[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.620]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue! Coming back to you a little later today, because I was
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.160]   traveling this morning. You could think Duncan is very accommodating. Remember, our email
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.080]   here is AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Today's show is sponsored by Liftoff, our automated
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.100]   investing platform powered by Betterment. Duncan, you know the greatest thing about
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.040]   Liftoff is, especially for this year?
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.420]   What's that?
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.000]   It's all asset allocation-based. You're not picking stocks. You don't have to see any
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.080]   individual names down 80%, 90%, because you hold index funds in these portfolios. Automated,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.880]   rules-based. That's a good thing, because we're going to get into it here. One of my
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.200]   most strongly held financial beliefs is that investing is simple, but not easy. In fact,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.000]   I think successful investing can be very difficult, especially when we're talking about stock
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   picking. So, take Facebook as a perfect example today. Coming into today, Facebook -- and
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.760]   I'm sorry, I'm never going to call it meta. It's not going to happen.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.280]   Yeah, same. I can't.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.200]   So, coming into today, the stock was down 66% from all-time highs. Those all-time highs
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.040]   happened a little more than 13 months ago, September 2021. So, this is pretty recent.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.960]   Today, the stock alone at one point was down 22%. Hadn't looked at it in a couple hours.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   That's good enough for a peak-to-trough drawdown of 75%. Three-quarters of the value of the
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.440]   stock, gone. So, John, do a chart out of the market cap loss of Facebook. This thing peaked
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   at $1.1 trillion. It's now down to $273 trillion. So, we've lost more than $800 billion in this
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820]   in 13 months. This is by far the greatest dollar loss in a company ever, and I don't
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.860]   think there's even a close second. To put this into perspective, $800 billion, that
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.080]   number of lost market cap value, is greater than every single company in the S&P 500 right
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.960]   now, save for Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. This is just a massive amount of wealth
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   that's just gone.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.840]   The last time the stock was at this level was in late 2015. The total revenue for Facebook
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.200]   was $18 billion. Last year, Facebook brought in almost $120 billion. So, Facebook went
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   public in the spring of 2012. From that point through the highs of September of 2021, it
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.520]   was outperforming the S&P by 800%. It was easily one of the best-performing big stocks
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.080]   of the decade, up that, not even close. John, do a chart out of the performance of the stock
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.800]   through today, since inception. Facebook is now underperforming from its IPO price, the
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.200]   S&P 500, on a total return basis. So, that's 800% of outperformance gone. The S&P is now
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.660]   outperforming by more than 25%. So, this is just a very not-so-gentle reminder that stock
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.240]   picking is extremely difficult, even over the long run, even for one of the best-performing
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.280]   stocks of the past 10 years. And the hard part is, from here, you think, well, okay,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.240]   the hard stuff is over, because the stock has already fallen 75%, but there's like two
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.800]   paths, I think, from here. One is, Facebook is just a broken company. They made a pivot
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.380]   to the metaverse at the worst time, and it could be a declining social network, and maybe
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.560]   it's just never going to regain those highs. The other thing is, you could say, well, this
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.640]   is a stock that is still just bringing in cash flow, the metaverse thing is going to
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840]   work. They just added legs to the metaverse. I mean, that's got to be worth something.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.480]   What if this is a generational buying opportunity? And honestly, neither outcome would surprise
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.120]   me at this point. And I give it up for people who want to make that call right now. I don't
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.040]   know if I could, but this just shows the perils of stock picking. And trust me, I still pick
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.520]   some stocks. I have a fund portfolio, but I still do this. It's really, really difficult.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.400]   Yeah, I mean, you just have to sell it at that peak, though. That's all you have to
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   do.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.680]   Of course, yes. Just sell in September 2021. It was easy to see that it was going to happen.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.800]   13 months ago, it was going to peak. And, ooh, boy.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.080]   Mine that looks like that is Oatly. It looks about the same.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   Okay, what is this? I've never heard of this company before.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.760]   It's Oatmilk. So, I was Peter Wenching, buying what I know, kind of thing.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   Oh, Oatmilk.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   Yeah, it's not gone well.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.680]   Is it supposed to be healthier for you? What's the story there?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   I mean, it's supposed to be pretty healthy. It's good for the environment, blah, blah,
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   blah, all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   It's like almond milk.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Yeah, it's non-dairy.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   Okay, gotcha.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.640]   Okay. Can't believe that stock is not holding up better.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.080]   Yeah, yeah. Easy to say now.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   Okay, all right. Let's do our first question of the day.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.800]   Okay. Actually, first up, I want to say happy birthday to Chris Vinh, our colleague here
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   at the firm at Rihls, and also my mom. They share a birthday. So, happy birthday, mom
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   and Chris.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.480]   I don't know your mother, but I'm sure she's great. She produced a fine gentleman as a
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.400]   son, and Chris is one of the best people I know in wealth management. Happy birthday,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   Chris.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Yeah, yep.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   Okay.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   All right.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.160]   So, up first today, we have a question from Bob.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.560]   Wow. Unusual year with both stocks and bonds both down at the same time. I'm in my early
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.120]   60s and still five to seven years from retirement. The current market environment has me wondering
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.620]   which is the better position to be in when interest rates inevitably peak and begin to
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.360]   fall and stocks rebound. Down 18% and sitting in bonds, or down 25% and sitting in stocks?
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.520]   What do you think?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.440]   I like Bob's line of thinking here, because a lot of investors in today's environment
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   are viewing losses through the prism of, "This is a nasty risk, and this is awful," instead
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.240]   of through, "Hey, this is actually an opportunity. Those losses are sunk costs. They happened
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   already. There's nothing you can do about them." So, let's look at the relative attractiveness
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.700]   of both. So, let's start with bonds. Interest rates for bonds are now better than they've
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.360]   been in years, maybe decades. So, John, do the table on here. This is just different
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.560]   types of bonds, short-term government bonds. The aggregate bond index is like a total bond
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.960]   index, corporate bonds, and then high-yield bonds. So, we're talking anywhere from, call
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.000]   it 5% to 9% for yields in bonds, average yield to maturity. That's not bad, right? And I
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.280]   actually think these yield levels are more important right now to the stock market than
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   inflation of the Fed, potentially, because for the first time in a long time, stocks
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.160]   have some competition in terms of, they're providing a decent yield in bonds that give
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.440]   stocks some competition for allocation. So, the stock market has done just fine with rates
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.480]   at these levels in the past, but we've never seen the relative attractiveness of bonds
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.800]   change so fast. So, I think investors finally see, even in short-term bonds and cash-like
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.600]   securities, that you can earn 4% to 5%. That has to change the equation in terms of allocation
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   for people. So, the question is, from bond investors, what happens here? So, Bob asks,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.800]   "What happens if rates fall?" But I think, if we're doing a scenario analysis here, there's
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.120]   really only three options for bonds, from what can happen in terms of a variability,
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   volatility standpoint. So, one, rates fall. Two, rates stay put, or just stay range-bound.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.680]   And three, rates rise. Inflation is obviously the wild card here for real returns, but let's
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   look for the possibilities. So, rates fall. That's what Bob is thinking is going to happen.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.760]   If you have any duration in your bonds, they're going to do better than any sort of long-term
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.200]   duration, or are going to do better than short-term duration, because if yields fall, prices rise.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.280]   And the more duration you have, all else equal, the better your bonds are going to do in terms
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.600]   of prices. So, rates could fall because the Fed decides to pivot in lower rates, or inflation
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.620]   could peak, or we go into a recession, or maybe all three of those things. And even
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.960]   during the '70s, John put a little chart on here, even in the '70s, rates typically fall
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.040]   during a recession, even if they pick up their upward climb after that. So, I actually think
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.520]   rates falling a substantial amount would be the worst-case thing for fixed income investors,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.200]   especially over the long term, because that means returns are going to be lower. They'll
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.760]   be better in the short term, but over the long term, you're going to lose that yield.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.160]   So, what happens if, let's say Bob is wrong and rates continue to rise? Prices would certainly
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.400]   fall again, for all bonds. They'd fall a little less for short-term bonds, and more for long-term
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.880]   bonds. And I think if rates do continue to go up, you're going to get a little more short-term
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.920]   pain. The thing is, this time around, there's a much bigger margin of safety for bonds,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.320]   because you actually have that 4-5% yielder sitting on, whereas before, the rate-hiking
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.120]   cycle happened when yields and bonds were like 0-1%. So, that's why bonds got killed
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.840]   so bad. There was no yield to cushion the fall. So, I actually think if rates rose a
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.720]   little bit more from here, that's not the worst thing for bond investors, because again,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   those higher yields eventually turn into higher returns in the future. It's just a little
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.780]   short-term pain to get there. And then, the other scenario is, let's say rates just stay
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.480]   range-bound, like 4-5% for a while. I actually think this is probably the most welcome thing
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.660]   for bond investors, even if you don't get that price kicker. You can kind of just clip
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.520]   your coupon. I mean, that's not always the case in corporates and high yield, because
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.600]   you have to talk about defaults and credit risk. But if we're talking about just government
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.480]   bonds, if you just clip that 4-5% for a while, rates stay where they are, in a range, maybe.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.400]   That's not the worst case, because bonds are supposed to be the boring part of the portfolio,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.780]   right? Now, so, that's bonds. I think, say, two out of those three scenarios are pretty
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.200]   good for bonds, in the short-to-intermediate term. One of them is better in the long-term,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.520]   if rates rise. So, let's look at stocks now. So, interest rates roll over. Bob's right.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.400]   You would assume the stock market would be doing better. So, John, let's do a chart on
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.120]   here. This is just, I've looked at this before, how the stock market performs when inflation
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.200]   is rising, falling, and then interest rates are rising or falling, using the 10-year yield.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.760]   You can see when rates are rising or falling from year to year, the returns for stocks
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.360]   are pretty much the same. It's like 9-10% average for both rising and falling rate environments.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.680]   But if inflation is falling, the stock market has above-average returns, talking like 15%
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   per year. If inflation is rising, we're talking more like 5-6% per year. So, stocks definitely
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.100]   do better when inflation is falling or rising, and there's not as much of a relationship
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.480]   if interest rates are falling or rising. However, I think you would assume if inflation is falling,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.200]   at some point, rates are probably going to come down a little, too. But the thing is,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.240]   what if inflation and rates are falling because we go into a recession? Does that mean stocks
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   are going to rise? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe people think that bad news in the economy
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.600]   is good news for the stock market, but I can't guarantee that. So, it's possible, but I have
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.840]   no idea. So, either way, whatever the reason is, we know that buying stocks when they're
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.720]   down 20-30%, historically, over the long term, has worked out pretty good for you. So, John,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.120]   do another chart on here. I've showed this before on other shows, and people are probably
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.280]   getting sick of hearing it from me, but hey, if you buy when the S&P 500 is down 25% from
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.040]   all-time highs, looking out 1, 3, 5, 10 years, the results are pretty darn good. The average
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.600]   returns are pretty good. The batting average is pretty good. The past is no guarantee of
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   future performance and all that, the usual disclaimers here. But it makes sense if you're
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   buying stocks when they're down 1/3 or 1/4. Over the long term, you're probably going
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.720]   to do okay, as long as the world doesn't completely fall apart. So, now what do we think? If I
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.640]   had to bet my life on it, gun to my head, all that stuff, bonds are probably a higher
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.160]   probability bet over the short-to-intermediate term for giving investors better returns.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   That seems to make sense, especially with yields so high. And then stocks are probably
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.040]   the better bet over the long term, which is not exactly going out on a limb here. But
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.960]   the good thing is that you don't have to bet your life savings with a gun to your head.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.000]   That's not an actual thing. So, you can diversify, especially if you're 5-7 years from retirement.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.320]   I go to the extremes and pick one or the other. Right? The great thing about diversification
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.120]   is you don't have to pick a winner in advance. Your portfolio is going to have it either
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.440]   way. And I think especially with yields higher, if you're approaching retirement, yeah, it
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.160]   stinks you're sitting on losses. But from here, from this point, the way things are
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.400]   setting up with higher yields for bonds and lower valuations for stocks, I think there's
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   a high probability of pretty decent outcomes for both from here, even though things have
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.000]   been really terrible this year.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.360]   I really like something you just said I wanted to mention on Animal Spirits yesterday. You
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.120]   guys were talking and you were talking about wanting to see someone do the research on
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   stocks that have come back from being down 90% and have hit new highs. I would like to
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.120]   see that, because I think that'd be really interesting.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:52.760]   Yes. How about when a stock loses $800 billion of market cap? That too? But I do think, again,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.200]   people have been saying this, 60/40 portfolios, that if you've been in a traditional portfolio
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.080]   of stocks and bonds this year, you've had a rough year. There has been nowhere to hide
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.340]   this year. Even if you were in cash, you're losing to inflation. So it's been a tough
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.560]   year for investors. I think you do have to turn it around and try to change the mindset
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.400]   to thinking like, okay, this is also an opportunity. It's hard to think that way. Things could
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.840]   always get worse. That's a caveat here. But I think we're in a pretty good position.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.560]   Yes. Makes sense.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.520]   All right. One more. Let's do it.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   Up next we have a question from Ramachandran. I'm a 28-year-old single male from the Greater
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.400]   Detroit area, Michigan. I'm maxing out my 401(k) and IRA, and today have almost $47,000.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.280]   My goal is to save $1.8 million in index funds before retiring around 65. Once my contributions
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.720]   reach $175,000, 30 more years of compounding at 8% annually will get me to my goal. Should
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   I reduce my contributions at that time to save for other financial goals, such as a
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.160]   house and education expenses for kids? I like this. They're looking so far ahead. 28 and
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   single looking for that.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.880]   Yes. I love the forward thinking here. Shout out to my guy here from the Detroit area.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.520]   I lived in Detroit area for a couple of years. That's where I actually learned how to drive.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   People over there are nuts on the highway. I think I increased my speed by 10 to 15 miles
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   per hour on average.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   It's Motor City, right?
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.560]   Yes. Yes. And if you drive a car that's not from Detroit, you get shunned over there.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   Definitely. I was glad I had my Ford Taurus when I was there. All right. So I love the
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.960]   forward thinking. I feel like thinking this way leads me to believe this person has read
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.300]   a personal finance blog post or three, maybe even one of mine, because you've heard me
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.300]   give this example before.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.360]   Like if you start saving at 25, you save for 10 years, you get 8% returns, blah, blah,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.680]   blah. You're going to do better than someone who starts saving at 35 and goes till 65 because
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.800]   you get so many more years ahead of the compounding, right? So it appears that's what the thinking
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.480]   is here. So I get to $175,000 by the time I'm 30 or 35, and in 30 years from there,
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:54.040]   I can count on almost $1.8 million. And it's true. I ran the numbers here. He's spot on.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.560]   $175,000 over 30 years at an 8% annual return year in and year out is going to be like $1.75
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   million.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.760]   It's hard to believe, because our brains don't think exponentially. So, John, do a chart
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.640]   on here. This is just the charts. This is just average returns, annual returns, and
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.860]   what they lead to over 30 years. So you can see an 8% return is like 900% in total. 9%
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:22.840]   return is over 1,200%. 10% return is 1,600% over 30 years. Even 6% is close to 500% total
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.740]   returns. So this is the power of exponential thinking and compounding, and it's pretty
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.740]   darn good.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.100]   And the other thing is, if you look at the history of the stock market, your worst case
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.320]   scenario historically, so John, put the next chart up. This is the rolling 30-year annual
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.640]   average return. I only did this for 2020 because this is an old chart, but it is what it is.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   The worst you've ever gotten is right around 8% investing at the peak in 1929. September
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.280]   1929, you invest, you lose 85% of your money in the Great Depression. Over 30 years, you
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.160]   still get close to 900% in total return and 8% annually. Something like that. I think
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.400]   it's like 8.50, a little less than 8. So that's the worst case you've ever gotten.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.720]   Now, can we promise this is going to happen going forward? Of course not, right? Again,
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.560]   the past performance is no predictive future performance. That's a pretty good track record
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:17.280]   over three decades. The problem is, what if you're wrong? That's the thing. There's no
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.560]   margin of safety here if you don't get 8%. So if you get 7%, you go from 1.75 million
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.200]   to 1.3 million. So you're almost 400 grand short. 6%, we're now looking at right around
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.360]   a million dollars. 5%, we're talking 750K. So you're a million dollars short of your
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.880]   goal. Right? That's kind of tough. If your entire financial plan is based on hitting
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   a specific return target and a specific dollar amount, you could be disappointed if the market
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.620]   doesn't cooperate. That's a big risk. The other thing is, what if the sequence of timing
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.440]   returns doesn't come in right? So you could say, "You're still going to get your 8% return,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.200]   but what if all those really high returns come early on in your career, and you get
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.720]   crappy returns towards the end of your career?" The sequence of returns, you could still get
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.760]   8%, but do much worse, because you retire right when the market crashes or something.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.220]   So the stock market returns are lumpy. You don't get 8% year in and year out. Inflation
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.360]   is the other big one. What if you hit your 1.75 million dollar goal in 30 years, but
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.760]   your standard of living is different, or that money doesn't go as far? So no one really
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   knows what their life is going to be like in 30 years. I like the idea here. And obviously,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.800]   there's a finite amount of savings for each person in terms of the goals they have. So
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.240]   if you want to cut back a little bit to buy a home and save for kids and whatever else
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.840]   you need to do, of course that's fine. Your money can't go everywhere if you don't make
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.280]   a ton of money. But I like the idea of at least continuing to get that company match
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:42.020]   in the 401(k) and save for those goals. Once you hit those goals, I'd be a little nervous
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.200]   if I'm completely giving up on retirement saving just because I'm going to have compounding
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.120]   do it all for me. I like the idea. I still think you should probably throw in a little
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.920]   margin of safety and just keep saving. Maybe you could decrease your savings rate once
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.200]   you hit that goal, but I'd keep saving. At least get your free match and go from there.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.520]   Right. Yeah. The match is free money, right?
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.360]   It is. But yeah, this person has obviously done a lot of personal finance research. And
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.240]   this is like, I always say a lot of these spreadsheet answers, like no one actually
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.360]   does this. This person is trying to do like a personal finance book. And I would say,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.080]   it's really intelligent, but also you want to leave some room for any mistakes or errors
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.320]   or the potential for your life to be different in three decades. No one knows what their
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.960]   life is going to look like in three decades. I don't know what my life is going to look
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   like in three weeks sometimes. Right. Yeah. Or three days, right?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.160]   True. Okay, cool. So up next, we have a question
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.480]   from Scott. I hope you don't think I cheated on you with another podcast, but I heard a
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.000]   tax expert on stacking Benjamins. Excuse me, sir.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.560]   Yeah. Ed Slott on October 10th episode said everyone should go all in on Roth instead
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.440]   of traditional across the board, including their 401k contributions. One of his arguments
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.280]   was that tax rates will be higher in the future, which I agree makes sense if you're in a low
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.080]   tax bracket. However, not to brag, but I'm in the 24% marginal federal tax bracket. I
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.960]   have a hard time believing that my cumulative tax rate in the future will be higher than
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.280]   my current marginal rate. Do you think I'm wrong? Well, hold on. We have a second part
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.960]   to this question. Yeah, there we go. Another argument was that you won't have to pay taxes
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.360]   on your investment gains with a Roth while all withdrawals from a traditional account
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.760]   are taxed as ordinary income. Anecdotally, his arguments make sense. However, I feel
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.840]   he's neglecting the time value of money, i.e., the upfront benefit of the deduction now versus
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.360]   the tax savings in the future. I'd love to see Ben put what he has learned from the CFA
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.080]   to work and crunch some numbers. I realize that you might need to break out a crystal
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.060]   ball to predict investment returns in future tax brackets, but I'm wondering if there's
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.320]   a break-even marginal rate, tax rate, where traditional 401k contributions make more sense
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.840]   than Roth. I've often wondered this, so I like this question.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.240]   There's a lot going on here. This is our first not to brag about a tax rate before, and I
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.080]   feel like that's a niche joke for 5% of the audience that will get that. I think Scott
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.200]   is smarter than I am here. He asked me to take my CFA hat out and fix this. Here's what
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.920]   they don't teach you in the CFA. Instead of crunching the numbers yourself for tax questions,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.680]   bring on an expert who knows how to do it better than you. I didn't learn tax in the
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.240]   CFA, so let's bring on a fan favorite here, Bill Sweet.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   Gentlemen.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   Bill, tax man.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   You're my tax expert.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   Good to be back.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.400]   Bill, through the magic of airplanes, I was in New York with you yesterday, hung out all
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.520]   day. We went out to a nice, fancy dinner together, and now I'm back here in Michigan, and here
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.360]   we are over the Zoom.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.080]   So Scott has, I think in our Google Doc here that we share with each other, you said this
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.520]   is a fantastic question. It's an intelligent question. Scott obviously has thought long
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:53.840]   and hard about this. Okay, what are we doing here? He wants to know, okay, I get the generalized
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.060]   thoughts about Roth, but what about my personal situation? So how does this factor in, since
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.320]   we know you're a big Roth guy?
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.240]   Yeah, first off, Ed Slott is a walking legend. The man walks on water in the tax world. You
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.340]   can cheat on me with Ed Slott any day of the week. Ed Zollers is my other main Ed in the
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.960]   tax land. He's a CPA. Ed Zollers, can you beat that name? There's only one name, I think,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   Bill Sweet. That's better than that. Tony Dindi and Jeff Levine, they surround out my
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:27.040]   Mount Rushmore. But Ben, did you know that the high marginal tax rate in 1945 was 94%?
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.240]   Okay.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.680]   So if you're bragging about your 24% tax bracket to your grandpa who landed on Omaha Beach,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.760]   you might want to hold that in because he cackles at your 24% tax rate.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.220]   If I had a 94% tax rate, I'm pretty sure I would be doing some illegal stuff and not
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.220]   paying my taxes.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.840]   Well, hopefully, no illegal stuff. We're an NSEC registered firm. But that was for somebody
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.560]   earning more than $200,000, right? And if you adjust that for inflation, it's about
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.000]   $1,000,000 in today. But still, thinking about earning an extra $100 and only getting to
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.680]   keep six, again, we have 2020 problems over here. We might have recessions in inflation,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.260]   but it was nothing like that.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.680]   So another stat I want to share with you guys is for the fiscal year ending August 30th
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.960]   for the US federal government. The US federal government received $4.8 trillion of receipts.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   That's pretty solid in the grand scheme of things. We might be in a recession, but $5
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.760]   trillion of tax revenue. The problem is we spent $5.8 trillion in the trailing 12 months
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.040]   for that extra trillion dollar gap, right?
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.160]   So my point here is I enjoy this question. I think it's a good one. But Scott, you are
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.880]   living in low tax nirvana right now, and we just don't know it. John, can you pull up
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.840]   that chart, the chart I slapped together two minutes before broadcast, by the way. Here's
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.520]   a quick look at historical US high and low marginal tax rates. And so right now we're
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.240]   at 10 and 37. And again, that's no fun. But like compared to history, we're in a pretty
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.680]   low tax rate. Really, like it was Ronald Reagan who came along in 1986 and said, enough of
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.080]   this 50 plus percent tax rate. And we really never looked back. Of course, budget deficits
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.440]   and everything like come with that. But I really want to turn this question around,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.000]   Ben, because ultimately, I think sometimes in this show, we spend a little bit too much
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.840]   time trying to game things, right? I mean, you try to be a winner with your investments,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.800]   right? You've successfully timed Michelin star restaurants, ordering chicken fingers
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.240]   and asking for ketchup there.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   I timed when to get out of the Michelin star restaurant.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.920]   It was a good move, but you missed the celebrity chef who came a couple minutes later. But
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.720]   leaving that aside, with perfect knowledge, knowing how the next 30 years of investment
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.800]   returns are going to pan out, future tax rates, and your life expectancy, yes, we can perfectly
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.920]   game this. But the future is not just unknown, Ben. It is unknowable. And I think it makes
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.240]   sense to optimize, but only up to a certain extent. And so, Ben, let me magically retire
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.760]   you in 2050 or so. If you're looking back, I think the goal is we want tax diversification,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.680]   right? We don't necessarily want to win, but we want to have a bucket of Roth, a bucket
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.840]   of pre-tax, a bucket of non-qualified assets. So, when we go out and spend money, we can
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.800]   pick and choose where that comes from to maximize our future tax rates. So, Scott, that's the
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.160]   frame I'd like you to think of. And Ben, when is the time when you might want to contribute
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.220]   to a Roth IRA compared to a traditional? Like, when in your life cycle?
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.280]   When you're young, right?
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.600]   When you're young, right? And so, Scott didn't give us his age, but ultimately, if he's in
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.560]   the 24% federal tax bracket, assuming that that doesn't jump up substantially, my guess
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.960]   is still probably pretty early in life. Now's the time to max fund a Roth. And I think somewhere
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.640]   around mid-career, you flip that switch and then you try to game it that way.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.400]   Yes. And the point is, too, optimization only works for the benefit of hindsight. You can't
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.640]   optimize for the future because we don't know about it. So, that's the point of diversification.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.800]   So, diversification in asset classes and how you save and when you save, and also your
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   tax rates, right?
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.400]   Yes. And I would listen to the legend, the man, the myth, Ed Slott. He knows what he's
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   talking about.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:54.880]   What would you say to someone who's young and who's like, "I'm at a relatively low salary
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.560]   compared to what I'll be making down the road. And so, this extra money in my pocket right
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.080]   now could be really beneficial."
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.000]   Yes. Again, that makes sense to me, Duncan. But I think you really have to balance that
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.840]   out between the power of compounding, right? And so, $1,000 today, you leave that alone
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.160]   for 30 years at 8%, like the questioner, the second questioner. That becomes worth $8,000
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.560]   to $20,000, right? Depending on how long your time horizon is. So, yes, you could use that
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.680]   money today, but you probably really want that tax-free compounding asset in the Roth.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.440]   So, it's a balancing act, but I don't know.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.880]   Bill is going to shame every young person into investing in a Roth.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   Yes.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   That's my goal here.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.480]   Well, now I'm thinking, what about that $8 coffee from Blue Bottle?
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.280]   No, I don't do that. I don't do avocado toast.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.000]   That's like 2015 bullshit. We don't need to play that game.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.760]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Willie, who I like to think is going to be Willie
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   Nelson.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.960]   "I sold my rental property this year, like Ben, and had about $125,000 of long-term capital
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   gains. I invested the proceeds in a few ETFs and now have some short-term losses. I'm a
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.640]   bit confused about how to deal with the wash/sell rule. If I take the loss to lower the hit
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.840]   of my capital gain, in theory, I can't invest in a similar ETF for 30 days. I don't want
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.280]   to be out of the market, and I really don't want to substantially change what I'm invested
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.960]   in for 30 days if I'm just going to switch back 30 days later and potentially have short-term
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.260]   capital gains. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is the tax-loss harvesting even worth
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.120]   the trouble? Can I go from VTI to SPY, or is that too similar?"
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.280]   These are questions you ask during a bear market. No one talks about tax-loss harvesting
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:35.360]   during a bull market. Bill, let's start with an explanation. Also, good job, Willie, selling
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   your rental property when you did.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.520]   Pulled a Ben Carlson up in here.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.680]   It would be a little harder to do right now. Let's start with a short explanation of tax-loss
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.880]   harvesting and then the wash/sell rule and how this works and why this is a rule.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.560]   Yeah, so just very quickly, Willie sold a property. He realized a gain of $125,000,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.480]   a taxable gain. At the end of the year, if he does nothing, let's say he's at 20% tax
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.160]   bracket, 15% federal, he's going to own about $25,000 right to the IRS. So that clock's
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   ticking. The gain's been realized. So Willie's question is, "OK, cool. I now have capital
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.000]   losses in the assets that I reinvested in." Let's say he has a $60,000 loss. He has the
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.160]   opportunity then to cut his loss in half, right? Because he realized a gain earlier.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.560]   Now he has a loss. At the end of the year, 12/31, at midnight, magically, the IRS ferry
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.760]   declares capital gain season over, and everything gets netted out throughout the year. So Willie's
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.480]   got an interesting opportunity here, and I would suggest that he acts.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.040]   Right, so use those losses to your advantage here, right?
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Yep, precisely.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.360]   And the whole wash sale thing is basically just so you can't sell a stock at a loss and
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   buy it back immediately because the IRS is-- you're just kind of locking in those losses,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.560]   and they don't want you to be able to easily do that.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.160]   Unproductive economic activity. Yeah, I think that's the rationale. And these rules date
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.800]   back to the Securities and Exchange Commission Act of this year.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.120]   Although you can technically do that in crypto right now, right?
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.360]   That's what I was about to ask, if you could still do that.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.560]   Because cryptocurrency is not a security, right? So all these SEC rules that were written
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.760]   in 1925, they apply to securities. But for reasons that are a little confusing and not
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   the subject of this question, cryptocurrency is not considered a security, but an ETF,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.040]   a stock is.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   So what is a wash sale rule? The 30-day wash sale rule is exactly like you described, Ben.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.880]   You're not allowed to book a loss for security that you sell and you rebuy it instantly or
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.600]   within 30 days. And it's actually a 60-day window. Because if you buy a security, let's
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.720]   say he just goes out and buys another ETF a day before, and then books the loss and
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.560]   just has that extra capital lying around. He's done that within 30 days prior to the
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.160]   sale. And so that loss would be disallowed as well if it's a substantially identical
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   security.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.320]   And so that language is really important. The tax code says it cannot be substantially
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.240]   identical. But nowhere in the tax code can you find out what substantially identical
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.760]   actually means. But luckily, throughout the last 100 years or so, some morons decided
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.880]   to push the issue all the way to the tax court. And some judge ruled a couple of rules and
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.100]   a couple of basic rules that follow. So substantially identical security is obviously the same security.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.540]   Another thing, if you have a different share class-- so Google trades two different share
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.640]   classes right now. Berkshire A, Berkshire B, that's substantially identical. It's the
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.040]   same company. It's the same underlying asset.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.840]   The other thing, options, calls, puts, those are considered to be substantially identical.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   So you cannot buy a call option, sell the stock, and then a day later exercise that
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.240]   call option, just rebuy it whatever price. That is substantially identical.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.960]   Another thing to keep in mind, thou shalt not buy this stuff in IRAs too. So if you
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.720]   have an automatic purchase of your company stock, Exxon Mobil, whatever else, in your
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.980]   401(k) or in your retirement plan, that is also considered a wash sale. And what happens
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.100]   is if you trigger these wash sale rules, like the universe doesn't end, you don't divide
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.920]   by zero, and your piece of paper, your computer melts down, what happens is your basis just
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   carries forward.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.800]   And so you basically paid that trading commission, or you exercise that bid-ask spread. And ultimately,
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.240]   it just carries forward.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.480]   So what's the solution here? Any ideas, Ben?
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:56.600]   So riddle me this. If he sells his S&P 500 ETF and buys a total stock market ETF, it's
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.800]   kind of different, right?
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.980]   Right. So that's the key, substantially identical. And there's been no case law on this, but
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:07.500]   generally practitioners, Ed Slott among them, say that if you buy a security that is tracking
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:13.440]   a different index, and so like the S&P 500 is a large cap US index, the crisp US total
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.200]   stock index, which happens to be one of the indices that the ticker that he mentioned
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:23.000]   follows, that is, in my opinion, substantially not identical. And it's a facts and circumstances
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.880]   test. But ultimately, if you're buying something that is the total US stock market versus the
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.400]   top 500 companies by market cap, that's substantially different.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.720]   And he got mid-cap and small caps in there.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.600]   What if Duncan sells oat milk, and he buys almond milk? Does that count?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.720]   I would say both are disgusting, and I would disqualify them from the wash sale rule.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.960]   Come on. We already did a poll. People love almond milk.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.160]   I think that would work out. It was actually split, and there was no cow. There was no
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:54.040]   organic cow listed there. So I throw that poll out. I thought this was an anti-poll
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   show.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.680]   One thing worth mentioning is that DRIP can mess this up too, right? If you're auto-reinvesting
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   dividends.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.640]   Yeah, that's what I was getting at before, Duncan. Precisely. So if that's happening
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.320]   in a different account, or even let's say you have a Liftoff account, because I'm a
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.920]   company man, and that is doing loss harvesting for you, you might have a buy in a certain
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.880]   security, and then you're trying to do this in your account. So you do. You have to take
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.240]   a holistic look. And again, it's actually a 60-day rule. 30 days before, 30 days after.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.120]   But I would do it, because ultimately, if you can cut your tax loss in half, that's
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.720]   money in your pocket. You realize that economic loss, and all you have to do is just buy a
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.240]   substantially not-identical security, and then you don't miss out on any of the market
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.520]   appreciation that may be coming in the future.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   All right. Duncan, one more question.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:40.880]   OK. Last but not least, we have a question from Kyle, who writes, "I hit my 401(k) pre-tax
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.480]   limit for the first time in my life last month as a result of a bit more aggressive saving
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   this year."
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   Congratulations, Kyle.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   Not to brag, Kyle. Nice.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   Yeah, not to brag.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   Good work, Kyle.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:57.000]   Close to 15%. "My company matches 7%. Backdoor Roth already maxed at $6,000, and my HSA contribution
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.680]   is maxed. I aim to go mega backdoor the rest of the year, but it sounds like the provider
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.080]   won't let me with my after-tax contributions. Now I'm stuck in a pickle. Keep after-tax
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   401(k) contributions up to keep getting the company matched for the rest of the year,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.960]   or cut back on the after-tax 401(k) contributions and maybe allocate to something else, like
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.520]   my after-tax brokerage bucket. Thoughts?"
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:25.080]   OK. So a good problem to have here. So Bill, I don't know why they wouldn't let him do
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.400]   the mega backdoor, but what are the options here?
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.360]   So ultimately, option one is I speed dial our company. I'm going to call the CFO or
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   whoever's in charge of the money and get that 7% match. That's tasty. We don't have that,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.840]   but the solution here, I would like to think about it this way. What is the order of operations
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:46.160]   of savings, right? And so where do you get the best bang for the buck or the most preferential
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.760]   tax treatment? I would start then, and you've advocated this in the past, for that company
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.120]   match, right? So whatever you need to contribute, I don't think you can necessarily call it
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.480]   free money, but if you're getting a 7% match, it makes sense just to contribute that 7%.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   It's a 7% rate.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   Yeah, I'll get the match.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.160]   That's it. So that's the ground floor, and now we're on the ground floor. Let's go to
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:07.600]   floor two. Big fan of HSAs. The listener maxed out his HSA. That's awesome, but ultimately,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.080]   HSA is the potential to be triple tax exempt, but that's not the question here. Next level,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.920]   Roth IRA. Why? IRA. You can get your basis back from an IRA tax-free at any point, right?
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.960]   You're not going to deal with penalties, and ultimately very flexible. I think that's the
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.640]   place to go for the next level. That's been maxed out. Now we're going Roth 401(k). $20,500
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.440]   is the limit that you can do with your own savings. So ultimately, we hit this this year.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.320]   Great. Now we're moving to the next level, after-tax 401(k). And what that is, that's
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.880]   that mega, super, whatever it is, backdoor Roth. Ed Slott's talked about this in the
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.600]   past, the namesake of this show, apparently. And ultimately, I think that's a cool thing
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.400]   to do, but that option is closed. Not every employer offers this thing.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.600]   I think Bill drafted Ed Slott in his tax fantasy week this year.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.040]   He is the number one draft pick, right? Year after year. But yeah, the mega backdoor is
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.560]   not available to everybody because it's super complex, right? And ultimately, the plan sponsors,
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.400]   they don't want to get into waging war with the IRS over this stuff. There's stringent
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.680]   testing requirements. We had to go to our plan provider, and it took us about two years
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.360]   in order to get them to play ball with us there, and many threats of leaving. So ultimately,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   if that's not an option, cross it out. I would say six is IBONZ. We've talked about them
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.880]   in the past, but that's a really interesting opportunity. You have until tomorrow.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.840]   Yeah, you have one more day to get that 9% rate, or 9.6, and then it goes down to 6-something.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.360]   The clock's ticking. If you're listening to the show on Friday, it might be too late.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.720]   But seventh would be a brokerage or tax-managed account. And so I think, ultimately, the listener
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.880]   here has filled up every bucket. Who is this? Kyle? Yeah, this is Kyle. Ultimately, Kyle
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.760]   has filled up every bucket. And so yeah, I think the next place to go is a tax-managed
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   brokerage account. I use Lyft Off. I'm a Lyft Off subscriber, a company man. That's where
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.760]   I would go. But something that can tax-manage assets, get maybe some tax losses in a year
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.400]   like this. So I think Kyle's got the right answer.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.680]   After all this wonderful tax talk, Kyle in the chat said, "A woman is marrying me, even
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.280]   though all I talk about is what you guys talk about." Easily our best backhanded compliment
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   of the day.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.200]   Hey, hiring at ritholdswealth.com. Come on, Kyle. But speaking of backhanded compliments,
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.880]   we did eat at a Michelin star restaurant last night, Ben, as you know. And the specialty
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.360]   of the restaurant was seafood. You and Michael said no, no to fish.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.720]   Michael and I are not huge seafood guys. And I think they were a little taken aback about
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   what to do.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.680]   It was a power move. I will say that. But I think they handled it. They handled it very
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.080]   well. It was a French restaurant. But when the dinner came and Ben asked for ketchup,
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   they asked us to leave politely.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.600]   I'm pretty sure that was Michael, but they didn't.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.440]   Yeah, the crazy thing was they gave me the Michelin star. They were like, "We can't have
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   this anymore."
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.680]   Not to totally derail this conversation, but whoever decided that a tire manufacturer gets
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.920]   to decide the best restaurants?
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.720]   Oh, it's a great history. I think it's like there was a travel guide, right? Back when
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   these were things.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   The Michelin guys.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.960]   Yeah, exactly. And so that was it. And it's just still here today with us.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.560]   I'm happy to take all the hate from not liking fancy restaurants in the chat room. I think
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.880]   you have to be selectively cheap in your life, and life is about trade-offs. And for me,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.560]   that means I prefer a burger and a beer to caviar and champagne. Sorry. I'm in a flyover
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.080]   state. I'm not one of these East Cody elitists. I'm sorry. We don't have any French--
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.120]   It was in honor of Mr. Venn's birthday, and a good time was had by all, except for Michael
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.560]   and Ben, who went to a Knicks game. But God bless them, that they have this option.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.000]   So thank you again to everyone watching live, everyone in the chat. Thanks, Bill, for coming
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   on again.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.040]   I got to answer a question that didn't have a Roth area conversion in it.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040]   That's true.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   Get this tattoo removed.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   We got some good ones.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.560]   Do you want to mention this email from Will before we get out of here?
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   It's kind of nice. We get a follow-up from someone who actually asked a question before.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.760]   And I think they asked us a few weeks ago. Basically, I'm in a great financial position.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.600]   I feel like quitting my job to help take care of my new newborn or new daughter or son,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   I think.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   What was the follow-up?
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.800]   Yeah. So Will wrote us. And this was from episode 42. Today's episode 50. So wow. We're
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   trucking along.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Very cool.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.880]   So Will said, "Hey, Duncan. You might remember this thread. Well, I can now say that Ben
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.680]   Carlson made me quit my job. A big step into the void of no income, right? Well, shortly
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.640]   after giving my two weeks, an old employer called me up begging for help. They want me
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.480]   to set my own consulting rate to do part-time work. I now have a super flexible schedule
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.080]   and make more per hour than I did before. My immediate worries over income were unfounded.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.400]   I feel blessed, but it is also a testament to how hard I've worked in my career. I've
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.080]   worked in compliance, and it's more valuable than ever because everything gets more complicated.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.800]   Most importantly, my daughter is, in her own way, grateful for the extra attention. Many
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.280]   thanks to what you guys are doing." And yeah. So that was kind of nice to see.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.960]   Very cool. Kudos to you. I was trying to help Jerome Powell by putting some out of work,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.480]   then they just go back and get another job.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   Right.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   But it's awesome.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.560]   This could have been a lot more awkward, right, depending on circumstances.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.320]   The flexibility is definitely the key here. And I think what we said was if you're in
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.000]   a good position to do this financially and you can handle it, then yeah, do what makes
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.880]   you happy. And that was spending more time with the daughter, and now another job came
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   about it. So that's awesome.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   It's the stuff of life.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.520]   It's more flexibility. Yes. Anyone else who's asked questions in the past, feel free to
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.140]   give us follow-ups. We'll shout you out on a future episode.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.120]   One other thing. We were number one investing podcast in Latvia in the last two weeks. So
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.400]   shout out to everyone watching in Latvia. We appreciate you.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.200]   Okay. How many Mission Star restaurants do they have?
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   A lot.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.800]   All right. Remember, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com, and we will see you next week.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.680]   See you, everyone.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   Thanks.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   Bye.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   Bye.

[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   Bye.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   Bye.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   Bye.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Bye.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Bye.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   Bye.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   Bye.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   Bye.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   Bye.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.320]   you
