[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.360]   So, Alan, I bought us a little extra time here.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.000]   Alan Roth is going to come up.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.760]   I want to introduce Alan.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.720]   He is a former board member for the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.640]   for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   He is an author.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.000]   His book is called How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400]   And it's a great Bogleheads book.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   I think Alan is going to be giving away a few of those books for people
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.160]   who will make a donation to the Bogle Center.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.640]   Alan is a columnist in several places,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.080]   AARP, etf.com, and financial planning.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.480]   He is just such a generous and thoughtful person.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.520]   And he has made huge contributions to Bogleheads over the years.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.800]   And we're excited to have him here as part of this track talking
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.720]   about the basics of investing.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.000]   So, Alan, come on up.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.200]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480]   >> Thank you, Christine.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.400]   That was incredibly nice.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.040]   I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.200]   I'm going to start with -- well, I was planning on starting
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.240]   with the two most important lessons in investing.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.680]   But I've got to start with something very embarrassing.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.480]   I need to borrow $1,000.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.080]   I haven't managed my money very well.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.760]   So I need to borrow $1,000.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.200]   I'm going to return every penny a year from today, lots of witnesses.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.520]   Who will lend me that $1,000?
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.000]   Christine, Mike, you're the nicest people in the world.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.920]   You're not going to lend me the $1,000?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   Why would no -- somebody's nice back there.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.360]   You would lend me the $1,000?
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.320]   Well, obviously, there's some really nice people in here.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.680]   But who logically and rationally would lend me $1,000,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.960]   and why would you not?
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.080]   No interest.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.280]   You want to make money off of my misfortune, not being able
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.840]   to manage my own finances?
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.640]   That's pretty reasonable.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.800]   You want to make more or less than inflation?
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.960]   More. Absolutely.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.640]   Which gets me to the two most important lessons.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   Oh, by the way, if you lent me money
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.560]   versus lending the U.S. government money via Treasury,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.760]   would you want to charge more or less me versus the U.S. government?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.400]   More. I'm riskier.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.720]   I'm a financial planner.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.320]   That means I'm not very good with my money.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.840]   So the two most important lessons
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.800]   in investing are you want to be compensated for taking on risk.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.840]   The second is a dollar today is worth more
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   than a dollar in the future.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.640]   Has anyone noticed that things are costing more
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.960]   than they did a couple of years ago?
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   Yeah. That's called inflation.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.920]   So you want to make more than inflation.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.200]   All right.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.920]   The million-dollar coin flip.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.960]   Is betting a million dollars even money investing?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.560]   Is there an expectation of profit?
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.080]   No. What about betting a million dollars on a coin flip,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.680]   whereas if you call heads and it's right, you get a $1,020,000?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   It is investing.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.640]   I wouldn't take that bet.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.840]   I would recommend that you not take that bet.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.880]   There's a fellow by the name of Daniel Kahneman
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   who won a Nobel Prize for prospect theory that shows we're going
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   to get twice as much pain from losing money
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.360]   as pleasure from making money.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.560]   But third is would you do a million one-dollar bets?
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.880]   What have I done?
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.160]   I think I heard a yes.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.480]   I saw a yes back there.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.640]   I would, because what I've diversified is
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   over the number of coin flips.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.600]   I should make $10,000 and a very,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   very low probability I would actually lose money.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.000]   And even if I did, it would be very little.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.400]   That's an example of diversification.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   So there are three types of risk.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.360]   There's default risk.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.680]   Let me just say lending money to Honest Al has huge default risk.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.480]   There's interest rate risk.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:10.600]   If you lent the U.S. government $100 for 10 years at 5%,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.440]   then you're going to get $5 a year back.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.800]   If interest rates went up to 7%,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.200]   then that means you're getting a below market rate.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   Interest rates have gone up.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.800]   The value of your bond has gone down.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.680]   And holding it to maturity doesn't help.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.160]   And then you have liquidity risk.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.960]   It would be a lot easier to sell somebody your treasury
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.880]   than it would be to sell the $1,000 loan to Honest Al.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.320]   So three questions.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.440]   Why do people invest?
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.840]   Because they want to grow their money, obviously.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720]   How do people invest?
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   We buy stocks, U.S., international, large companies,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.920]   small companies, energy, tech.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.280]   We buy bonds.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.080]   We buy investment grade or one
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.960]   of the few terms the industry has gotten right.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.360]   Junk bonds, high yield bonds.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.520]   We buy gold.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   We buy bitcoin.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.360]   We buy all sorts of things to invest.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.160]   And where do we get investment advice?
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   From our friends, from our neighbors, from TV, mad money.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   My personal favorite are newsletters.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.520]   If I knew how to beat the market, do you think I would try
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.720]   to create a newsletter and try to sell it one
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.360]   by one for $299 a year?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.280]   Jim Cramer, mad money.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.120]   I'll let you in on a secret.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.640]   The head of his foundation once shared their investment results
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   with me.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.200]   He earned half of the return of the U.S. stock market.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.200]   So financial versus real assets.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   First of all, if you don't save, investing doesn't matter.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.760]   So you've got to reduce current consumption today
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.400]   to have a better financial independence in the future.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.520]   Or even a better thing to do is get the best deals
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.320]   on what you do consume.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   And I will say that Clark Howard is to savings
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.160]   as Jack Bogle was to investing.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.120]   So I'm just absolutely thrilled.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.680]   I've gotten to know him over the years.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.760]   An absolutely wonderful guy.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.880]   For planned consumption later.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.040]   Real assets are used to produce goods and services.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.160]   I could buy a new car so I could make money.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.360]   I could invest in a new car to become an Uber driver.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.040]   That's an investment in a real asset.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.080]   Or financial assets which are claims to real assets.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.200]   If I buy a stock, I have a claim on that company.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:19.440]   So major classes of financial assets.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.760]   There's debt.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.040]   There's bonds.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.360]   There's CDs.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.160]   There are money markets.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.560]   There's common stock.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.160]   When we think of a stock, we generally think
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.360]   of a common stock.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.240]   There are some stocks that have preferences known
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.200]   as preferred stock.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.600]   And in spite of the name preferred,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.000]   I recommend against them.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.040]   And then there are derivative securities.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040]   Futures. Energy futures.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   Options. Puts.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.080]   Calls. Anybody know how much has been made
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.640]   in the history of the futures
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.360]   and options market before costs?
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.840]   Zero. Was that you, Mike?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.360]   Yeah. Well, Mike knows everything.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.800]   Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.640]   That is not investing.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.920]   That is gambling.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.800]   That's like betting on the Broncos.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.120]   Oh, it's painful.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.560]   So stocks and bonds are the two principal areas
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.280]   where people invest.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.840]   If I buy a stock, I am one of the owners of that company.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.360]   I have upside if it does well, NVIDIA.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.880]   I have downside if it doesn't do very well.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.400]   Like General Motors, it was at one time when I was small,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.120]   viewed as safe as the U.S. government.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.240]   I'm glad that wasn't true.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.560]   So goes America.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.840]   So goes GM goes America.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.320]   I'm glad that wasn't true.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.440]   And a bond is you're lending money to a company.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.360]   And that company is going to pay you interest
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.480]   and the principal back.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   You've got no upside, no claim on how well the company does,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.040]   but you have more protection
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.240]   than a common stock on the way down.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.040]   Choices are asset allocation.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.560]   Yes, in general, stocks are a lot riskier than bonds.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.960]   You've got security selection.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.600]   If I'm going to own some stocks, which ones should I buy?
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.320]   Is Exxon going to do better than Chevron?
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.160]   Is Amazon going to do better than Walmart?
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.680]   Those are the choices.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.840]   So valuation.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.080]   Why does Exxon Mobil, my first employer
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.240]   out of business school, by the way, why does it have value?
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:00.000]   Because it is going to pay us dividends and we hope
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.880]   that it will pay us more and more.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.120]   And then we are also buying their cash flow.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.560]   This is more, rather than investing 101,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.520]   this is more investing PhD, but a stock buyback is a far more
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.240]   efficient way, tax-efficient way for a company to return money
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   to shareholders, even though it has a terrible name
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.520]   in the press, in the media.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:34.960]   Okay. Now, what I have here is a genuine, real,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.520]   completely fake gold coin.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.840]   Why does it have value?
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:50.440]   Because we say it does.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.480]   It's rare and it's pretty.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   Belly button lint is pretty rare, but it's not so pretty.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.000]   Bitcoin. Why does Bitcoin have value?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.520]   A lot of value.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.240]   There are actually some utilitarian uses for it,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   whether or not it's over or undervalued.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.800]   I certainly wouldn't bet much on it, but that's why it has value.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.360]   So what is riskier?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.640]   A portfolio of 100% in one stock or a portfolio comprised
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.440]   of thousands of different companies?
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.360]   The latter.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:43.000]   And by the way, does that mean a diversified index fund owning
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   thousands of companies has no risk?
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.320]   No, it has risk.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.840]   But it has a lot less risk than buying any one company.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.160]   So I'm old.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.600]   You know, back when I was in grad school, shortly afterward,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.360]   the largest ten companies,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   the most valuable ten companies back then,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.280]   versus the most valuable ten companies 40 years later.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   And by the way, things change.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.200]   That list of 2020 is no longer valid.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.960]   NVIDIA is in there.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.320]   By the way, what do you notice about most of the companies,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.120]   the most valuable companies today?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.760]   Did they exist 40 years ago?
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.280]   They did not.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.960]   So there's this big debate, active versus passive.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.760]   Active is finding undervalued securities, timing the market,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.240]   which by the way, I'm going to admit, I'm a market timer.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.080]   Passive management, which Jack Bogle brought us,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.000]   no attempt to find undervalued securities
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.320]   and no attempt to time the market.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.840]   And then holding an efficient portfolio.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   What is the efficient portfolio?
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.520]   Which stocks should you buy?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.640]   All of them.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.960]   So there's this whole active/passive debate
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   and efficient market hypothesis.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.000]   Is the market efficient or not?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.200]   And I argue, doesn't matter a bit.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.360]   What matters is arithmetic.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.120]   If the U.S. stock market earns 10%,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.040]   the average investor is going
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.680]   to get 10% minus what they pay in fees.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.840]   If the market loses 10%, the average investor is going
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.320]   to lose 10% minus what they pay in fees.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.800]   So owning everything at the lowest cost.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.880]   And by the way, this year, you may have heard of the term,
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.640]   the Magnificent Seven tech companies like Alphabet, Apple.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:08.720]   They are .2% of the U.S. companies and maybe .1%
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.080]   of all companies, including international,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.400]   and they have driven the entire return.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.640]   Now, when it comes to market timing,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.960]   when I was in business school,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.920]   I was taught we couldn't time the market.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.760]   But it turns out we're really, really good
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.240]   at timing the markets really, really poorly.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.680]   And Morningstar's Mind the Gap does an amazing job of showing
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.360]   that shortfall year after year after year.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   If you look at fund flows into stock funds, rather, that,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.320]   you know, we hit the .com bubble and people panic and sell.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.120]   Then it goes back up and we buy.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.480]   Then the financial crisis hits and we panic and sell.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.800]   Then it goes back up and we buy.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.080]   Then COVID hits.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.240]   This has never happened before, a pandemic.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.520]   We panic and sell.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.440]   That was the shortest bear in the history
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.280]   of the U.S. stock market.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.840]   But we are really, really good
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.200]   at timing markets really, really poorly.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.960]   So what I do for myself and my clients is
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.520]   to set an overall asset allocation target.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   And guess what that means?
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.200]   When stocks go up, you have to sell.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.880]   When stocks go down, you have to buy.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.080]   Really, really simple and really, really hard to do.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   And let me tell you, when I bought stocks in March of 2020,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.840]   when stocks fell 35% in 33 days, that was anything but easy.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.560]   It took 10 minutes, but it was really hard.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.160]   So, you know, in conclusion,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.720]   investing is really, really simple.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.520]   Taxes aren't, and Mike is really,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.560]   Mike Piper is really an expert on helping there.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.520]   It's simple, but not so easy,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.920]   especially when money starts meaning more to us.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.800]   And the older we get, by the way, the more money means to us
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   because the less the human capital we have
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.720]   and the more the investment capital we have.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.480]   Never take on uncompensated risk.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.360]   Own every stock in proportion to the market.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.200]   Now, nearly 15 years ago, I wrote this book,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.720]   How a Second Grader Beat Wall Street.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.320]   And cap-weighted investing, meaning that you buy more
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.960]   of the large, most valuable companies like Apple and Amazon
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.040]   and less of the smaller companies, was out of vogue.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.320]   Everyone was factor investing, smart beta.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.000]   It didn't work going forward.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.600]   So, own every stock in proportion to value,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.680]   and something like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.840]   we've got a great speaker who runs that fund,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.760]   at a .03% expense ratio, does the trick.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.900]   And then, when it comes to fixed income,
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.020]   take your risks with stocks.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:14.400]   Your fixed income, you want to be very, very safe.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.560]   So, in conclusion, investing is really simple.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.400]   In eight words, anything that you do, ask,
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.640]   are you minimizing expenses and emotions?
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.000]   And are you maximizing diversification and discipline?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.400]   Simple yes, easy no, and when you're eight years old
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.040]   and money doesn't mean anything to you, duh.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.320]   The older we get, and like I said, I'd be lying
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.360]   through my teeth if I said it was easy to rebalance
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.520]   and buy more stocks in March of 2020 when our lives had changed
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.840]   and suddenly we weren't going to the office,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   we weren't socializing, who knew what was going to happen.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   It's really, really hard.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.480]   So, anyways, that is investing.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.240]   You know, I didn't know that we were going to -- oh, Christine,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.760]   you're going to do introductions, wonderful.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.440]   Thank you.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.880]   [ Applause ]
