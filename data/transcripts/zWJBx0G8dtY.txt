[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Jeremy writes in to ask, "In light of the doctrine of predestination, how are we to
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.040]   go about day-to-day evangelism? I used to tell people that they are dearly loved
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400]   by God, that Jesus loves you, but if they are not one of the elect, then is it
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.040]   honest or right to tell them this?" So Pastor John, here's a question. How do you
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.880]   handle the language of God's love for sinners generally in light of Reformed
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:35.280]   soteriology? It is honest to say to the world, "God loves you," because I think
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.120]   that's what John 3:16 says and means. "For God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.480]   only Son, so that whoever believes, so that the love of John 3:16 is a
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.360]   indiscriminate love that consists in a bona fide offer of his Son to every
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.520]   person for their receiving." And Matthew 5, "Love your enemy and you will be like
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   your father who makes the sun rise on the evil and the good." So there are
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.360]   numerous places where God's universal love is spoken, and it's not wrong
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.880]   therefore to say to people, "God loves you." But here's what has to be clarified as
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.640]   far as biblical soteriology goes. He doesn't love everyone in the very same
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.880]   way. He has set his electing love on some freely without any of us deserving it,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.320]   and these will believe. Acts 13, 48, "As many as were appointed to eternal life
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.280]   believe." So the love of God in their case is a specific and particular love of
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.080]   drawing them to himself. He doesn't have that love for everybody or everybody
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.400]   would be saved. So in view of those distinctions, my answer to how we
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.360]   evangelize is this. We love people by telling them the best news in all
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.480]   the world. And what is that? God, the God against...you look at...so you're
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   meeting with somebody and you want to tell them the good news, you want to
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   evangelize them. You say, "The God against whom you have committed treason offers
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   complete amnesty freely. He will commute your death sentence. He will forgive your
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.640]   treasonous intentions and actions and feelings. He will put away his just and
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.880]   holy anger against you. And not only that, he will adopt you into his royal family,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   make you an heir with his son, and unless you doubt that this is possible for him
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   to do this, just simply justify the wicked, he put forward his son to bear
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.520]   the death sentence and perform every duty that you have failed to perform if
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   you would have this. He raised him from the dead to show that the
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.440]   death of his son was sufficient. He offers you now all of this through his
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.880]   son. It's all free. You can't earn it. You can't deserve it. The condition is to lay
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.560]   down the arms of treason, the arms of rebellion, and bow in humble, helpless
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.760]   dependence on free mercy from the King and receive his full pardon and amnesty
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.200]   and acceptance. So we preach, Tony, we preach indiscriminately to everybody. We
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.320]   say that to everybody. We don't try to figure out who the elect are and preach
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.720]   to them. That's the error of Hyper-Calvinism historically. We offer
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.400]   Christ. We offer Christ and all that Christ is. We say, "If you will have Christ,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.120]   I'm offering you Christ and all of his benefits," and then we pray for the people
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   that their hearts would be opened and the heart of stone would be taken out and
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.360]   the heart of believing flesh would be put in. We plead with them, "Be reconciled
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.820]   to God," and then God does the calling. God gives the faith. God overcomes the
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.120]   resistance. God takes out the heart of stone. It's our job to preach the
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   unsearchable riches of Christ and to offer them freely to everybody. Yes,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.760]   amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast. Please
