[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.200]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the fourth chapter and the twenty-fourth verse. The twenty-fourth
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.280]   verse in the fourth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, "And that ye put on the
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:28.880]   new men, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." As I call attention to
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   this once more, let me remind you of the importance of taking it in connection with the previous
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.840]   statement that he put off concerning the former conversation, "The old men which is corrupt
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.760]   according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind." And that he put
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.920]   on the new men, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. This is
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.600]   the practical exhortation that the apostle addresses to these Ephesian Christians, you
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.640]   remember. He has been reminding them of how they have learned Christ, and that if they
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.560]   really have learned him, if it isn't merely an appearance, if it isn't but a pretense,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   if it isn't just some emotional or psychological experience apart from truth, if they really
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.480]   have learned Christ and know the truth as it is in Jesus, well then, he says, there
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:48.560]   can be no question about it. You will put off that old man. And as you are being renewed
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.040]   constantly in the spirit of your mind, you will put on the new men. But as we have seen,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.000]   he not only tells us to do this, he gives us reasons why we should do so. He gives us
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.840]   again a reminder of the character, the nature of that old man. And then he describes in
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.560]   the glowing terms that we have been considering the last few Sunday mornings, the nature of
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:28.880]   this new man, created after God, in the image and likeness of God, in the image and likeness
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.080]   of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the new man, and that is the reason why we should
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.960]   put him on. Created thus in righteousness and holiness of the truth, what men lost in
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.160]   the fall, this righteousness and holiness is restored, and more than restored, in this
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:04.120]   new creation, this act of regeneration, this rebirth which takes place in the soul of all
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.520]   who are truly Christian. And the apostle's argument is that because that has happened
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.680]   to you, put it on, he says. It is no use telling people to put on the new men if the new men
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.080]   isn't in them. It is because the new men was in them that he exerted these Ephesians
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.640]   to put him on, and it is still the same.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440]   Well now there, we've been looking at some of the reasons why we should put on the new
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   men. There remains just one further thing for us to do, and the most important one it
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:50.760]   is. It is this. How do we put on the new men? How do we put him on? Now, if we avoid this
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.080]   or evade it, we are in a very dangerous position. There is nothing, I suppose, that is finally
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:07.180]   so dangerous as to look at a great truth like this merely in a theoretical manner. Nothing
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.520]   can be more dangerous to the soul than to have a form of godliness but to deny the power
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:23.640]   thereof. Our Lord himself said, "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.360]   And I say it can be really devastating, as history proves abundantly, for men to look
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   at this exalted and glorious doctrine of the new men in a purely objective, academic, and
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.160]   theoretical manner. That is a wonderful concept. Oh no, the apostle here, and in this whole
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.920]   section of this great epistle, is concerned to be very, very practical. We shall find
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.280]   him going on to say something like this, "Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.800]   with his neighbour," and so on. Now, but we must, before we come to the actual details
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.040]   given to us by the apostle, we must look at this question of putting on the new men in
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.060]   this practical way, in a more general manner than that. And that is what we have to do
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.400]   this morning. Now there are certain principles which we must bear in mind. And the first,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:36.040]   of course, is this. This is something that you and I have to do ourselves. I indicated
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.240]   this as we were dealing with the practical part of putting off the old men. And it's
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.520]   equally essential that I should underline it and emphasize it this morning. This is
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:58.400]   a command. It's an exhortation. Put on the new men. He's addressing them. He is exhorting
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.680]   them to do this very thing. Let me make it plain, therefore, by putting it negatively.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   This is not something that you and I just pray about. The whole of the Christian life
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.240]   is a life of prayer. But this particular thing is something that you and I have to do. We
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.040]   don't pray that the new men may be put on us. We put on the new men ourselves. That's
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:34.000]   the first negative. But look at this one. This is not something which suddenly happens
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.680]   to us as an experience. Now there are many who confuse it in that way and think that
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   this is something that takes place to us, that we suddenly have an experience. And as
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.840]   the result of that experience that we find that the new man is upon us, as it were. But
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.080]   again that's a denial and a contradiction of what the apostle is saying. Now the relationship
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.200]   between this and experience is a very important one. And I think it can be put very simply
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:16.640]   like this. Experiences, any spiritual experience that we may have, either in a service like
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.900]   this or when we're alone and reading the scripture or praying or whatever we're doing, any experience
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:31.600]   that we have assists us and helps us and urges us to put on the new men. But the experience
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.120]   is not the putting on of the new men. It will create a desire to do so. It will make it
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.960]   easier for us to do so. But the actual putting on of the new men is something that you and
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.400]   I obviously have to do. As we have to stop doing certain things and thereby put off the
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:00.880]   old men, so in exactly the same way we do certain things. And as we do them we are putting
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:11.680]   on the new men. Or let me put it like this finally. This is something that is not done
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:21.360]   for us. It is, I say again, something that we have to do ourselves. Now I'm emphasizing
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.000]   this once more because there is a familiar and a popular teaching which puts its whole
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.520]   emphasis upon the fact that the whole secret of this matter and the whole secret of Christian
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   living is that we cease from our activities and that we just look to the Lord. And that
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.200]   all we've got to do is to look to him and to abide in him and he will do it for us.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.440]   The question, I'll put it in this form, the question for those who believe that is just
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:09:00.000]   this. How do you reconcile that teaching with this command, with this exhortation? Put on
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.200]   the new men. How can you reconcile that with these details that follow about lying and
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:13.160]   about stealing and about being angry and so on? Now the apostle never teaches any word.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.320]   Just pray to the Lord to take that out of your life. He says stop doing it. You stop
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:26.960]   doing it. It is not something that is done for us. It is something that we have to do.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.920]   Otherwise, as I've pointed out, the whole of the practical sections of these New Testament
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.720]   epistles just become entirely meaningless and purposeless. Indeed, we can go further.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.520]   On that theory, the apostle was saying something that should never be said.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.560]   Well, but says someone, how can the men do all this? We are weak and we are frail and
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.520]   there are these great powers against us. Well, the answer is that this exhortation is addressed
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.520]   to people who've got new life in them. They are born again. The Spirit dwells within them.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:07.400]   The power is there. And what we are told to do is to exercise and to make use of the power.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.320]   Let me quote to you again what is probably the key verse with regard to this whole matter.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:22.200]   It's in Philippians 2, verses 12 and 13. Now says the apostle, "I am exhorting you, not
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   as in my presence, but much more now that I am absent from you, work out your own salvation
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   with fear and trembling. For, because it is God that worketh in you both the will and
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.640]   to do of his good pleasure." He is not just asking natural people to do this. Of course
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.520]   they couldn't. He is asking people in whom God is working mightily by his Spirit to work
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.280]   it out. It's not you saying, "I haven't got the power." You have the power. And what you
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.680]   are exhorted to do is to realize that the power is in you. And that as you exercise
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:08.840]   yourself, you'll discover the power is there. That is the mystery of God's way of sanctification.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.640]   You don't wait to have the power. In the rebirth, the power is there. And as you exercise
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.920]   it, well, you'll find you've got it. And as you exercise it, you'll have more of it.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:25.320]   It's exactly like our muscles. You'll never know your muscular power until you begin to
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.280]   use your muscles. And it is as you use them, you're often surprised at the strength and
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.700]   power you've got. And more, as you do that, well, you're working up more power. And so
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:43.160]   it goes on and on. You and I must not worry about the power. God gives us the power. What
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   we are called upon to do and exhorted to do is to use it and to exercise it. Take again
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.320]   a similar statement in the thirteenth verse of the eighth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:04.600]   Romans. "But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.440]   That's it, you through the Spirit. The Spirit provides the power, and the Spirit is in us.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.280]   So that being the case, we are exhorted to put off the old men and to put on the new
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.060]   men. Very well, there is just the first question. But now let us really descend to the practical
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.140]   details.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:36.020]   What then, says someone, have I got to do? Here it seems to me the best way is to put
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:44.980]   it in the form, first of all, of some general principles and then some detailed practical
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:53.680]   examples and illustrations. Now, these general principles are most important. It's no use
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.740]   going to the details unless we are right about the principles. This is the truth that always
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.500]   needs to be underlined. This is applicable not only in the realm of the spiritual life,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:14.220]   it's obviously true in any profession or any work or any kind of business. The man who
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:21.020]   rushes to details without having certain general principles is a man who is going to go astray.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.260]   If you are studying geometry, you start with your axioms, you can't do anything without
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:31.340]   them. It's the same, I say, in any kind of study, whether it be art or science. There
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.680]   are certain basic laws and principles. Get hold of them, then proceed to the practical
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.400]   details. Well, now we can do that here.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   So here is our first general principle. The putting on of the new men is something that
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:57.520]   must be done completely. It must always be done as a whole, and it must apply to the
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:04.200]   whole of our life, and it must apply to the whole of our life continuously. What I mean
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.280]   by all that is this, that we must never do this in compartments. We must put on the new
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.800]   men not only in certain parts of our lives, it must be in the whole of our life. We mustn't
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.320]   put on the new men only at certain times, or when we are in certain company, or when
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:29.840]   we are in certain places. No, no, that's to deny the whole principle. The new men must
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.880]   be put on as a whole, and he must be put on everywhere, and to cover the whole of the
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:43.400]   life. This is an illustration, you see, that the apostle uses, this putting on the new
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.880]   men, and it's an illustration that can be misunderstood. What he really is saying is,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:56.760]   you see, that the new men must be the reigning and the governing principle of the whole of
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:03.600]   our life. That we must realize now that because we've been born again, we've been moved
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.520]   from the world into the kingdom of God, and that therefore the whole of our life and all
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:17.880]   our conduct is going to be entirely different from that which we lived before. There is,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:27.800]   I say, a sense in which the apostle's illustration can be misused. Put on, he says, the new men.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.920]   And as we've seen, it makes us think of putting on a cloak, or putting on a gown or
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:39.880]   something. All right, it's a good illustration as long as we don't abuse it. And alas, we
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:47.080]   are all very prone, I fear, to misuse it. We misuse it like this. Perhaps it isn't
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:54.400]   as common today as it was in the Victorian era, when people, as it were, put on their
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.920]   religious cloak on Sundays and go to a place of worship. And after they'd gone home Sunday
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.880]   night, they'd put it off again. And they lived as hard-headed businessmen of the world
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   the rest of the week, and you'd never suspect that some of them were ever Christians. It
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.840]   doesn't mean that sort of thing. Or you sometimes see it like this. You see a group
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.040]   of people talking together, and you look at them and you'd think, well, they're typical
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.520]   people of the world. Their whole demeanor, their whole department, their whole appearance,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.360]   their mannerisms and everything, well, they're just. Then suddenly they become serious, as
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:38.320]   they give out a hymn or something. No, that's not putting on the new men. That's hypocrisy.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.240]   That's putting on a mask. That's the exact opposite of what the apostle means. You see,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.920]   it isn't something that you put on now and again, and you suddenly become serious. No,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.080]   no, no. This is a governing principle in the center of a man's life that controls everything
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   he does, wherever he is, whatever the company, it doesn't matter. Putting on the new men
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   means that the new man is here at the center and he's directing everything and all my activities
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:13.320]   under every conceivable circumstance. How important it is that we should remember that
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:21.800]   principle. Let me put it in this way. In a sense, it should never be necessary for the
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.560]   Christian to pull himself up and to remind himself that he's a Christian. What the apostle
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.640]   is saying is this, put on the new men and then you'll always remember that you're a
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:39.560]   Christian. There's the line, you see, between this and hypocrisy, between Hamburg and Shem.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.440]   There are people, of course, who are so much afraid of being Hamburgs as Christians and
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.720]   so much afraid of being hypocrites that they never put on the new men at all, and nobody
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.000]   knows that they're Christians. They just appear as men and women of the world. And
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.480]   that, of course, is equally foolish and equally bad. As long as we bear in our minds that
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:08.600]   the apostle is just using a picture and that what he is impressing upon us is always, in
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:21.160]   everything and in all times and places, living as this new man that you are in Christ Jesus.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.480]   Comprehensive.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:29.960]   Then the next point that we come to is this, that the whole essence of this matter of putting
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:41.360]   on the new men is really the application of truth to ourselves. I'm never tired of saying
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.560]   this because I verily am of the opinion that it is the most important thing one can ever
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:56.640]   discover in the Christian life. The real secret of Christian living is to discover the art
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:04.960]   of talking to yourself. We've got to talk to ourselves, we've got to preach to ourselves.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:12.240]   That is putting on the new men. It is to take truth and to apply it to ourselves and to
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:18.680]   keep on doing so and to repeat it and repeat it until we've really got it. You've got to
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.120]   regard yourself as your own congregation and you've got to learn to speak to yourself and
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   preach to yourself and hammer at yourself until you've really convinced yourself. That
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.080]   is what is really meant by putting on the new men.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   In other words, this isn't something that you wait for. If you wait until you feel like
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:52.760]   the new men, it'll probably never happen. You've got to remind yourself actively. There
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.680]   is no greater snare in the Christian life than just that idea that, "Well, you say
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.360]   it's no point in my doing anything now. I don't feel like the new men. I'll wait until
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:10.280]   I feel better and then I'll do it." My dear sir, that is the way never to do it.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.880]   You literally have got to take hold of yourself in this matter. Putting on the new men means
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   taking hold of yourself and dealing drastically with yourself in putting off the old and here
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.800]   now in putting on the new. Well, what does it mean? Well, let me put it again like this,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.160]   coming right down to details. You've just got to go on telling yourself that you're
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:39.200]   the new men. The apostle putting it in his epistle to the Romans in chapter 6 verse 11
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:47.040]   says this, "Reckon yourselves, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin and alive unto
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.680]   God." Reckon yourself. Say to yourself, persuade yourself, argue, say to yourself,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:00.480]   announce it to yourself. Now, I'm very fond of putting it in this form as you know. Put
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.720]   on the new men. Yes, the moment you wake up in the morning, say to yourself, "I am the
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:13.120]   new men in Christ Jesus. I'm not the old men. I don't belong to the world. I belong to God.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.880]   I belong to Christ." It doesn't matter what you feel like when you wake up in the morning.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.800]   Say that to yourself because it's the truth about you. That's what he means by putting
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.720]   on the new men. You've got to do it. It's something active. Don't wait until you're
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.360]   moved to do so. Move yourself to do so, says the apostle. Put him on.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:39.520]   Now then, you see the analogy. In the physical sense, you may not feel like getting up in
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.400]   the morning, but you get up. You may not feel like dressing. You prefer to lie in bed, but
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:51.120]   you get up and put your clothes on. Do the same here, says the apostle. The devil will
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.760]   be there governing your feelings, and he'll suggest his thoughts the moment you wake up,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.400]   and his insinuations and innuendos and evil thoughts may come, a thousand and one things.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.680]   You stand up and say, "No! I'm a new man in Christ, and I'm not going to live my day
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.840]   like that. I'm going to live as the man I am." That's putting on the new men. You say
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   to yourself whatever you feel like, because you know it's true.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.080]   Now then, let me take that principle also and apply it in my next and my third general
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:36.920]   point. Use everything that you know of that reminds you of the new men and that feeds
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:43.160]   the new men and that helps to build up the new men. You see, all this is the exact opposite
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:50.640]   of putting off the old men. In putting off the old men, you remember we made this point.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:59.900]   We said the apostle tells us, "Make no provision for the flesh. Don't feed him." If you know
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:06.320]   that reading certain literature gets you down, stop reading it. Starve the old men. Strangle
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:14.080]   him. Be violent with him. "Mortify," says the apostle. And mortify means mortify. You
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.880]   hit him, you pummel him, you strangle him, you throttle him. Get rid of him. Mortify
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:26.360]   him. Don't feed him. Do the exact opposite. Starve him. But here you see the new men put
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:33.400]   him on. Oh, feed him. Give him the sustenance that's likely to help him and to make him
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.760]   grow. And do this diligently and constantly. How do you do that? What are these things?
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.280]   Well, here obviously is the first. You read your Bible. If the essence of putting on the
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.800]   new men is the application of truth to yourself, what can be better than to familiarize yourself
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:58.040]   with the truth? Now, remember the principle I've just been laying down. Read your Bible,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.160]   I say. Read the scriptures. "Oh, but you see, I don't always feel like reading your scriptures."
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:10.920]   I know you don't. Make yourself read the scriptures. This isn't a question of feeling. This is
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.040]   something that is essential to your life and well-being and health. Therefore, do it. And
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.440]   I say, rouse yourself to do it. It can be done. It's got to be done. We can shake ourselves
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.920]   physically and we can shake ourselves spiritually. "Star up the gift that is in thee," says
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.800]   Paul to Timothy. That's exactly what I'm saying. And so, you see, you may say, "Oh, but I don't
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:42.640]   feel like it." Well, now then, there are many things you can do about that. Sometimes it's
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:50.400]   quite a good thing to prepare yourself for the reading of the scripture by reading something
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.680]   about the scripture, by reading some exposition, if you like, or by reading a portion of a
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:03.280]   biography or some statement of experience. You know how the old people in the days when
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.120]   they had pumps to get their waters, sometimes you'd have a pump that if you just tried to
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.760]   pump it, nothing happened. Well, the thing to do then was you took a little can and got
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.040]   some water from somewhere and poured it into the pump, and then you began pumping and out
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.600]   came the water. That's a great principle in the spiritual life. You've got to prime the
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.960]   pump. It has to be done very often. You've got to know yourself. You've got to understand
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.800]   yourself. You must learn how to handle yourself. And there are many things which one thus has
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.320]   to do with oneself in order to bring oneself into the right state and attitude and condition.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   What is so fatal is just to sit down and wait until you feel like it. I say you'll never
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:49.560]   do it. Rouse yourself, stimulate yourself, and then when you come to the scriptures,
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.440]   well, we mustn't read them just mechanically and say, "Now my scripture portion for today
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.640]   is so and so. I've done it. Off I go." You might as well not have done it. There's no
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   value in that. When you do come to do it, well, see that your mind is on it. See that
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.840]   you're concentrating. Read intelligently. Look for truth. Merely to read through the
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.560]   Bible once a year, well, it's a good thing, but it can be a useless thing spiritually.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.760]   We've got to learn to read with a spiritual mind and understanding. Ask questions. Say,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   "What's that saying? What's it saying to me? What's the point there? Who is he saying
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.840]   that? To what kind of person is he addressing?" And it becomes not only interesting, it becomes
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   absorbing. And as you're doing it, you're feeding the new man and thereby putting him
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   on. So we rouse ourselves in various ways to read the scriptures. And then, of course,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.920]   we should never attempt to read our scriptures without praying God to bless it and to enlighten
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:57.320]   us by the Spirit. Oh, what a difference it makes. And to pray about the whole of the
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:04.120]   life. We are God's children. Well, go to him as your father. Tell him about your difficulties
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:10.440]   and your weaknesses. Ask him to give you wisdom and understanding. The more you pray, the
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:16.120]   more you thank God for what he's done to you in Christ and by the Spirit, the more
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:22.680]   you're putting on the new man and the more his life will be manifest in your activities.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.200]   So prayer, obviously, solitary, isolated, lonely prayer, prayer with others, these are
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:36.320]   the ways of putting on the new man and then fellowship with like-minded people. The saints
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.960]   have always found it most strengthening to meet together, to talk together about these
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:51.120]   things, to pray together. "Iron sharpeneth iron." Of course. "Like attracts like."
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:58.640]   Of course. "Birds of a feather flock together inevitably." The nature is there and it talks
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   to the other and it recognizes it. And as you see it in another, you are strengthened.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.360]   That's the value of a church and that's why your radio and your television and all the
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.760]   rest of them put together will never be a substitute for the church. Impossible. They
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.860]   can't. It's where two or three are gathered together. And not only is he there, but we
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:24.440]   recognize one another and that stimulates the life of each. So the church is essential
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.140]   and that's why the author of the epistle to the Hebrews says, "Neglect not the assembling
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.720]   of yourselves together as the manner of some is, they were the people who went astray."
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.640]   Now you can't do it by reading a book only, though it's a good book, or by listening.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.680]   I say, "No, there is something that when the saints come together and the Spirit is
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:51.600]   present, then God acts." He works still through the church. The church is his own creation.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:29:00.560]   Very well, there are certain obvious general principles. They will cover all the details
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:07.040]   and all the particularities of our actions. But at the same time, let me give you some
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.760]   of the truths about which we have to remind ourselves in particular.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:22.920]   Put on the new men. Very well. What do I remind myself of? Well, the first is this, that I
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.200]   really have no choice at all in this matter of putting off the old men and putting on
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:35.000]   the new men. Why? Well, because I am not mine own. There's no need to argue about these
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:44.280]   things as false. Flee fornication. Why? Because you are not your own. You have been bought
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:53.080]   with a price. The Christian is not a free man. The Christian is the bond slave of Jesus
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:30:02.360]   Christ. That is why I always feel it's very wrong to appeal to people to do these things.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.080]   We need to be exalted, not appealed to. I don't like that preaching of sanctification
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.400]   which says, "Now do this and you'll be marvelously happy and you'll have victory,"
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:18.600]   and so on. That's the wrong way to put it. You are not your own. You have been bought
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:26.760]   with a price. You have no right to do anything else. You're a rebel if you attempt it.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   We have been bought and purchased by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:45.840]   and without spot. He gave himself and all that that involved, that you and I might be
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:54.400]   new men. Remind yourself of that. Remind yourself of that first thing in the morning. Remind
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:01.920]   yourself of that constantly throughout the day. You are not your own. You have been bought
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   with a price. And that in turn leads to this, doesn't it? The privilege and the dignity
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:23.680]   of our position. Created, he says, after God in this righteousness and holiness of the
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:31.920]   truth. You know, if you and I only remembered who we are and the dignity of our calling
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.080]   and our position, there'd be very little problem left in our lives. But we've got
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.480]   to remind ourselves of this. You've got to tell yourself, as I say, who you are and
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.720]   what you are. Listen to Paul putting it to the Thessalonians. He says, "You are not
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.600]   children of the night. You are children of the day. You are children of light. Walk,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.240]   therefore, he says, as the children of light." Did you notice how he put it there in writing
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.760]   to the Romans? "The night is far spent." We've finished with all that. It's no
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   longer chambering and wantonness, that mighty word that came to Augustine, you remember,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.360]   and was the word of life and of God and of regeneration to him. "The night is far spent.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   The day is at end. Let us not any longer, therefore, walk in that way, but put ye on
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh." We are the children of
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:39.320]   God, the children of light, the children of the day. And what we mean by putting on the
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:46.480]   new men is that we remind ourselves of that and remembering that we walk as such. And
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:53.240]   our whole demeanor and department, our very stance, our entire attitude is the complete
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:33:02.400]   antithesis of those who belong to the night and the darkness and who hide behind doors
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   and who are ashamed of the light and the sunshine. "Children of the heavenly King, as ye journey,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:21.560]   sweetly sing. Only let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Jesus Christ,"
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:27.000]   says Paul in Philippians 1.27. Well, there it is. Let's remember that. And then that
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.280]   in turn leads us to remember this. Let us ever remind ourselves of the family that we
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:40.680]   belong to and the family that we therefore represent.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:52.200]   We are indeed the children of God. "Beloved," says John, "now are we the sons of God."
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:59.080]   Now already! And this is such a startling and staggering conception of the Christian
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.320]   life that a man who once realizes it finds himself inevitably putting on the new men.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:13.200]   We are now the children of God. That is the whole trouble with the Christian church today.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.840]   She does not realize that. The church is regarded as just another institution and our assemblies
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:27.960]   are so like political gatherings. We are the children of God and we are altogether different
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:37.600]   from the world. This is the thing that we need to recapture, and that it is our privilege
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:47.000]   to represent the family in this world of time. We are strangers and pilgrims in this world.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.560]   As Christians, we rarely no longer belong to it. We are still in it, but our citizenship
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:58.320]   is in heaven and we are visitors. We are strangers. We are here for a while and we must live as
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:05.840]   such. We do not conform to that. We belong to that.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:15.800]   And the whole glory and dignity of the family depends upon us and is in so many senses in
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:23.360]   our hands. And that, you see, in turn leads to this, that we put on this new man and he
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.960]   governs the whole of our activity because, well, being strangers in a strange land, we
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.720]   are being observed and people are looking at us. And they say, "Who are these people?"
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.400]   Well, they say, "They are Christians." "Oh," they say, "this is Christianity, is it?" And
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.040]   they are going to judge Christianity and they are going to judge God and they are going
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   to judge the whole of the gospel by what they see in us. Of course, they are quite wrong
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.200]   in doing so, but they do so and you have got to take people as they are and you cannot
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.880]   blame them for doing it. You and I, therefore, should remember that putting on the new man
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.000]   means being always conscious of that.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.880]   Listen to Peter saying this. "Dearly beloved," he says, "abstain from fleshly lusts which
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:16.520]   war against the soul, having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, whereas that whereas
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:24.280]   they speak evil against you as evildoers, they may by your good works which they shall
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:31.720]   behold glorify God in the day of visitation." Now, there it is in a nutshell. "You are strangers
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.960]   and pilgrims," says Peter. "You do not belong here." Well, now, these Gentiles are watching
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.400]   you and are looking at you. They are speaking against you. They say you are mad. They say
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:44.040]   you are fools. They say you are hypocrites. They are saying things like that. But, says
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:54.080]   Peter, so live as to convince them and to silence them and to bring them into such a
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.920]   position that they shall praise and glorify God in the day of visitation. Turn that up.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:08.200]   John Peter 2, verses 11 and 12. But, indeed, it is everywhere running right through the
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.680]   whole of the Scripture.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.880]   Now, putting on the new man just means that. And if we really do believe these things and
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.720]   that Christ has died to make us such and to make these things possible for us, I say it
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:26.120]   needs no pressing. We, our very sense of honour, shall be involved and we shall feel that we
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:33.800]   are cads if in any way we let him down or misrepresent his wondrous grace and love with
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.720]   respect to us.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:42.680]   And that brings me to my last point, which is this. Our destiny, all these things you
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:49.880]   see follow in a logical sequence. Is there anything which is more powerful as an argument
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:56.560]   than this? Having reminded yourself that you are but a stranger in this world, well, then
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:06.800]   go on to remind yourself of where you are going and that knowing the time that now it
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   is high time to awake out of sleep. For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.840]   We are moving on. Every day takes us nearer. Nearer what? Well, it is coming. The night
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:32.960]   is far spent. The day is at hand. What day? Well, the day of Christ, the day of the Lord,
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   the day of his coming back, the day of the last judgment, the day when all men will have
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:51.000]   to appear before him, the final end of history. The night is far spent. The day is at hand.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.840]   Or listen to John putting it in his way. He that hath this hope in him, what is it? Well,
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:06.880]   he says it is this. We know not yet what we shall be, but we do know this, that we shall
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:18.640]   see him as he is and we shall be like him. Our very bodies glorified, we shall be perfect
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:27.200]   and spotless, without any vestige of sin remaining. We shall be like him. That is what we are
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.920]   going to. Now, if we really believe the gospel, if we have truly learned Christ, we have learned
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.080]   that, that all he has done is to prepare us for that day. Well, I say, if we believe that,
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.440]   we must rouse ourselves, put on the new man. The night is far spent. The day is at hand.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:52.360]   Let us no longer sleep. Let us prepare for the crowning day that is coming, for the beatific
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:40:00.680]   vision, for our final glorification, for our entry into the eternal state, for the joy
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:11.760]   and the bliss and the glory of sharing the life of God throughout eternity. That is putting
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.040]   on the new man, reminding yourself of this truth.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:24.080]   And then finally, remember this, and I believe this is the climax, the mightiest argument
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:34.600]   of all. If we are Christians, it means this, as the apostle has already told us in his
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:49.200]   third chapter, Christ dwells in our hearts by faith. Or, listen again, "Know ye not
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:41:00.920]   that your bodies, your very bodies, are the temple of the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:13.260]   us?" What is to put on the new man? It is to remind yourself that Christ is dwelling
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:29.880]   in your heart by faith, that the Holy Spirit of God that dwelt in him dwells in us. If
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.520]   only every Christian in the world this morning lived in this world as remembering that the
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:45.280]   Holy Spirit dwells within him or her, what a revolution it would create. The whole church
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.860]   would be transformed, people would not recognize themselves, and the world would look on astonished
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:59.720]   and amazed. That is what it means to put on the new man, to realize that he is in you,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:11.420]   and that anything unworthy or sinful grieves the Holy Spirit that dwells within us.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:18.580]   Let us therefore start our day by reminding ourselves of these things. I am a child of
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:24.980]   God, I am born again, I am a partaker of the divine nature, Christ is dwelling in my heart
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:30.880]   by faith wherever I go, whatever I do, the Holy Spirit is in me and in my very body,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:44.420]   so that my every action is known to him, the Holy Spirit. And as you live your day remembering
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:59.500]   that, it will obviously change everything. And that is to put on the new man, which after
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:10.400]   God is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Amen.
