[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   fasting. Oh yeah. Intermittent fasting. Yep. We need to distinguish between the two, of course.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   Perhaps the most common question I get as it relates to males versus females is,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.480]   is intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding as it's sometimes called,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.220]   an eight-hour feeding window, a six-hour feeding window, a 10-hour feeding window.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:35.680]   Is that something that perhaps differs in terms of its impact and how well it works for men versus
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.480]   women? Yeah. That's a short answer. Great. Yeah, yeah. So I'll put some parameters around it,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.860]   right? So if we talk about intermittent fasting, that's where you have like the 20-hour non-feeding
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.760]   window or you're holding a fast until noon or after. And then we have time-restricted eating and
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.200]   that's the fancy way of saying normal eating where you're having breakfast and then you stop eating
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.940]   after or you don't have anything after dinner, right? So you're eating with your circadian rhythm during
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.560]   the day. If we look at intermittent fasting where you're holding the fast up till noon or you're
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.720]   having days of really low calorie restriction, we see in active women it's very detrimental
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.360]   unless you have PCOS or you have some other subclinical issue. And the reason for that is
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.200]   we as women have more oxidative fibers. So we hear about all the things about fasting to improve our
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.720]   metabolic flexibility, to improve telomere length, to improve parasympathetic activation. But by the
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.240]   nature of women having more oxidative fibers, we are already metabolically more flexible than men.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.040]   Interesting. I didn't know that. Could you elaborate on more oxidative fibers, what that is and how it
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.300]   relates to metabolic flexibility?
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.880]   Sure, sure. So oxidative fibers are muscle fibers that are more aerobic capacity. So those are the
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640]   ones that you can go long and slow for a very long period of time because it uses a lot of free fatty
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.160]   acids. You need a little bit of glucose in order to activate those free fatty acids. So when we look,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.700]   when a woman starts to exercise, she goes through blood glucose first and then gets into free fatty
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.860]   acid use, she doesn't tap so much into liver muscle glycogen, which is, I think, another misconception
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.300]   that happens. So when we're talking about fasting or fasted workouts, trying to improve that metabolic
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.200]   flexibility, it increases stress on the woman. And so when we're talking about overall stress, we're talking
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:40.120]   about cortisol increase and they can't hit intensities high enough with no fuel to be able to invoke the post-exercise
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   responses of growth hormone and testosterone, which then drop cortisol. So from an overall stress perspective, that
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.460]   fasted workout and holding that fast for a long period of time increases cortisol. But then when we look from like a
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.300]   hypothalamic point of view and we're looking at how the brain reads it, we know that there's one area of
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.340]   kispeptin neurons in the brain for men, but there are two for women. So the two areas are distinct where one controls
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.480]   appetite and luteinizing hormone and the other one is looking at estrogen and thyroid. So if you start having an exercise
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.900]   stress or a daily stress of getting up and going on with your day without fuel, you perturb those kispeptin neurons and
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.780]   downregulate them. And so when you start downregulating them, we see that after four days, you
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.040]   have a dysregulation of thyroid. We have a change in our luteinizing hormone pulse, which is really important
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.140]   to maintain endocrine function. And we'll hear this, oh, I've been fasting for so many years and it does
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.160]   great for me. But the other side of the question is, well, how much better would you be if you were to
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.260]   actually pay attention to your circadian rhythm and fuel according to the stress at hand
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.720]   and knowing that you're going to garner less stress that way? And if we're really tying in nutrition
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.220]   according to that profile, instead of following a fast, we see better brain improvements as well.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.080]   We see more cognitive function. We see less thyroid dysfunction. And overall, a woman does much better
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.020]   when we're not in that fasted state. Then when you look at population research that's coming out now,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.900]   they're showing in both men and women who hold their fast till noon and then have an eating window from
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.080]   noon to maybe 6pm have more obesogenic outcomes than people who break their fast at 8 and finished
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.660]   their eating window by 4 or 5pm. So it's coming back to the chronobiology of we need to eat when our body
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:46.820]   is under stress and needs it. Unless we have a specific issue like obesity, inactivity, PCOS,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.720]   or other metabolic conditions, then we can look at using fasting as a strategic intervention to help
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:02.040]   with those modalities. Super interesting. Two questions. Is there a protective effect of starting the eating
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.980]   window, and here I'm asking for both men and women, starting the eating window at say 11am or noon and
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.260]   ending it a little bit later? So not a six hour eating window or seven hour eating window, but extending
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.920]   that to 8 or 9pm. Under those conditions, do you still see the obesogenic effect?
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.020]   Yes, because we're looking at the way cortisol responds. We know cortisol has lots of fluctuations
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.460]   throughout the day, and it peaks about half an hour after you wake up, right? So if you're having that
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.600]   cortisol peak half an hour after you wake up, but you're not eating, then that is that higher baseline
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.860]   sympathetic drive for women. For men, it's not the same. So when we're looking at that obesogenic outcome,
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   the actual timing hasn't been tested yet to see how can we expand or contract that eating window for men.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:59.620]   But for women, because of that cortisol peak, that right after waking up, women tend to be already
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.420]   sympathetically driven. So then they walk around more tired, but wired, and have a really, really
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.320]   difficult time accessing any kind of parasympathetic responses down the way. Where if you have something
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.540]   really small, where you're bringing blood sugar up, then it's signaling to the hypothalamus, hey, yeah,
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.940]   there's some nutrition on board, then we can start our day. So again, it has to look at that circadian
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.900]   rhythm and those hormone fluxes, which people don't really either understand or talk about,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.680]   because all of our hormones flux through the day. And so you have to look at where's the peak of
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   cortisol, how does estrogen flux, how does luteinizing hormone flux, progesterone, all of these things that
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.100]   have this tight interplay. And the more we're doing the hormone research, and the more we're
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.840]   understanding these perturbations, and how important it is to fuel for it to stay out of any kind of low
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.360]   energy availability stance. It sounds like intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.420]   unless it's very well aligned to the circadian rhythm, is not going to be advantageous for women.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.660]   That's what I'm hearing. I'm also hearing that if a woman trains while fasted, so in the non-feeding
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.400]   window, so wakes up, maybe has some hydration and trains, that's going to further exacerbate the
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   stress response in a way that's not going to be good. Exactly.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   And I have to imagine that if she also is drinking caffeine in order to do that training, because
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.240]   caffeine is a stimulant of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, that it will
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.340]   further exacerbate all these issues. So this is an eye-opener for me, because I've had female
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.740]   training partners for years. I don't eat until 11 a.m. I like to hydrate and caffeinate before I train
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.240]   in the morning, and then I like to eat starting around noon. Several of them have hopped on that
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.600]   schedule with me. Some of them eat breakfast first, some of them don't. They do as they choose,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.100]   of course. But now I'm thinking that's probably the worst way to go.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.220]   And it gets worse as you get older, because if we're seeing as women are getting into perimenopause,
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:10.640]   which is in their 40s, and we have more fluctuation of those hormones and an increase in baseline
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.520]   cortisol anyway, then when you look at fasted training, it increases that cortisol drive and
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.740]   that sympathetic drive. And because it's a point where you really need to polarize your training
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:30.140]   to get any kind of body composition change, not having any fuel before high intensity workout puts
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.840]   them in moderate intensity. They just can't hit the intensities they need to. Same with resistance
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   training. Like you go in and a lot of women are now working on sessional RPE or rating perceived
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.140]   exertion, where you go in and say, okay, we need you to hit an eight on the squat. So you have two reps
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:52.600]   in reserve and a sessional RPE of an eight. Well, if they're not fueled, then we're seeing trends that
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.800]   they're missing around two to 5% of that top load. So they're not really lifting in that zone that they
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.460]   need to be in.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.580]   And they're not really lifting in that zone that they need to be in. So they're not really lifting in it.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.520]   And they're not really lifting in that zone. So they're gonna be lifting in that zone. So we're
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.840]   going to be lifting in that zone. So we're going to be lifting in that zone. So we're going to be lifting
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.300]   in that zone. So we're going to be lifting in that zone. So we're going to be lifting in that zone. So we're
