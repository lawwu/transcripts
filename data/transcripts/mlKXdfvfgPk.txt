[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   A podcast listener named Doug in Ohio writes us with a very common and an incredibly important
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.720]   question too.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   We see it all the time in the inbox and for good reason.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   Here it is.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.720]   If my repentance is genuine, why do I keep confessing the same sin?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   Here's specifically how Doug put it.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320]   Dear Pastor John, hello and thank you for APJ.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.360]   Your biblical responses have helped me in times when I needed guidance with handling
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   circumstances in life.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.640]   My own question has to do with repentance.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   Does true repentance mean that we never ask for God's forgiveness for the same sin twice?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.000]   Numerous are the times that I have had to ask for forgiveness for all manner of sin.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.840]   But how can I say that I have repented if I commit the same types of sin over and over?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.760]   This question plagues me to such a degree that I am sometimes seized by depression when
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760]   I think of it.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.160]   Pastor John, what would you say to Doug?
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.440]   Doug's question is one of the most common questions that an honest and serious Christian
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.240]   has to ask.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.240]   The question of repeated sinning in the light of the demand of the New Testament for holiness
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.520]   and the warnings that faith without a changed life is dead—James 2:17—and that there
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.080]   is a holiness without which we will not see the Lord—Hebrews 12:14—and if you love
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.160]   me, Jesus said, you will keep my commandments—John 14, 15—and many will say to Jesus at the
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.120]   last day, "Lord, Lord," and he'll say, "I never knew you because you didn't do
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.840]   what I said"—Matthew 7, 23—and how can you still walk in your sins if you have died
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.120]   with Christ—Romans 6, 2?
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:01.480]   So this is an urgent and common, rightly common, question among serious, honest Christians.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.520]   Let me start with a clarification of how to even pose the question in language that I
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.000]   think is perhaps more consistent with the way the New Testament speaks than the way
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   Doug set it up.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   Doug uses the word "repent" to pose the question that he has.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.320]   He says, "Does true repentance mean that we never ask God's forgiveness for the same
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.360]   sin twice?
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   How can I say that I have repented if I commit the same types of sin over and over?"
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:51.280]   I would suggest that we not use the word "repent" for the way we respond to daily sinning as
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   Christians.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   That may surprise people, but let me try to explain.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.520]   And yes, I do assume that Christians sin every day because Jesus said alongside, "Give
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   us this day our daily bread, forgive us our debts."
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.120]   So I take it for granted then that he wouldn't have said that if there weren't a need for
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.660]   daily forgiveness of our sins, our debts to God.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.040]   And of course, I'm giving a very radical New Testament definition of sin when I say
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.760]   that, namely—here's my definition—any thought, any attitude, any word, any facial
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.040]   expression, any gesture, any action that does not flow from a treasuring of Jesus is
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920]   sin.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   Sin is not just big bad deeds like murder or stealing or adultery or even more regular
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.960]   sins like dishonesty or foul language or impatience.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:10.880]   Sin is a condition of the heart that is bent away from God in preference for other things
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.000]   and any expression of that preference in our mind or attitude or behavior.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.200]   So sin will be with us.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.040]   Yes, it will.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.160]   Sadly, it breaks our heart.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:33.400]   Sin will be with us until that inner condition is wholly obliterated in the presence of Christ.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.040]   And I'm saying that the New Testament does not encourage us to use the word "repent"
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.760]   for the daily activity of acknowledging those sins and bringing them to God and expressing
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.120]   our sorrow and hating them and turning afresh to walk in the light.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.680]   Rather, the word "repentance" in the New Testament refers to a more basic, fundamental
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.720]   change of mind, the kind we experience at the beginning of our Christian life and that
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.660]   we may have to experience if our life takes a terrible turn into a path of destruction
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.120]   from which we need to be called back, as in the churches in the first chapters of Revelation,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.520]   which were all called to repent because they're going to be destroyed, their candlesticks
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.920]   going to be removed if they don't repent and turn back from that pattern of life they've
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.280]   been living.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.560]   But the New Testament doesn't use the word "repentance" for the daily habit of dealing
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.400]   with our indwelling recurrent sin.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.520]   Rather, I would suggest that 1 John 1, 8 and 9 proposes the word "confession."
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.560]   from all unrighteousness.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:07.080]   So what about sins, then, that we commit more than once, indeed so often, that they are
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.920]   threatening to destroy our assurance of being a Christian?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.280]   And here's the way I would put it.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.400]   There are two kinds of confession, and there are two kinds of sin.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   So test yourself now as to which you are doing.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:31.680]   First, there is confession that at one level is expressing guilt and sorrow for sinning,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   but underneath there is the quiet assumption, "This sin is going to happen again, probably
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.520]   before the week is out.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.880]   I'm going to look at nudity in a movie or at some website again, or worse.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'm going to overdo it with alcohol again, probably this weekend.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.720]   I'm going to laugh at those demeaning jokes at work again tomorrow.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.240]   I'm going to avoid confronting my colleagues' dishonesty again.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   I'm going to respond in a belittling way to my wife when she looks that way at me again,
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.440]   probably two days from now."
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   In other words, this kind of confession is very superficial.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.660]   It's a cloak for fatalism about your besetting sins.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:34.520]   You feel bad about them, but you have surrendered to their inevitability.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.160]   That's one kind of confession.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.040]   The other kind of confession is that you express guilt and sorrow for sinning, just like with
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:53.480]   the first kind, but your hatred of the sin is so real that you have every intention,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.560]   as you confess, of making war on that sin.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   Like this weekend, you aim by the power of the Holy Spirit to defeat it.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.040]   You are going to seek out whatever ways are going to help you put this sin to death.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.960]   You are going to rob it of its power.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.120]   That's the plan.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   No hypocrisy.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.800]   Now, those are the two ways of confessing sin.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:29.000]   The two kinds of sin that I'm referring to are, first, the kind of sin that blindsides
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   you.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's not premeditated or planned, and there is scarcely any battle in the moment when
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.120]   it happens.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.400]   Before you're doing what you wish you hadn't done, it's done.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.200]   In my own experience, I would illustrate with certain kinds of sinful anger that come over
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   me, and almost instantly I can tell, "That's over the top.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's not holy.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.720]   It's not righteous."
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:04.600]   Or maybe spontaneous unkind words that just pop out of my mouth, and I'm ashamed of them
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.640]   as soon as I say them.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:15.800]   Or say, a reflexive sexual fantasy owing to some decades-old experience, or a recent advertisement
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   that you saw while you were looking at the news, or whatever.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.440]   I'm not excusing these things.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   They're sin.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   They're sin.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.640]   They show something about my heart.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:33.680]   I'm calling them sin, even though they are more or less spontaneous and not premeditated.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.880]   Now here's the other kind of sin that I'm referring to.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   Namely, it is premeditated.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:48.760]   You actually sit there or stand there weighing whether to do it or not, whether to look at
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:55.360]   the pornography or not, whether to stay and listen to the dirty jokes or not, whether
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.520]   to call out the injustice at work or not, whether to be dishonest on your tax returns
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   or not.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:09.200]   You take 10 seconds or 10 minutes or 10 hours wrestling, and then you do the sin.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:18.280]   I think it's possible for a Christian to commit both kinds of sins and get into patterns of
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   both kinds of confession for a season.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:32.600]   But I would say that the confession that cloaks fatalism, hopelessness, peace with sin, and
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:39.920]   the sin that is premeditated are more dangerous to our souls.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   Both are dangerous.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.300]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.280]   Both are dangerous.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:52.120]   But the confession bordering on hypocrisy and the sin bordering on planned unrighteousness
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.240]   are more dangerous.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   And Paul acknowledges in Romans 7, as I understand, verses 16 to 19, "I do what I do not want,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.760]   and I do not do the good I want."
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.800]   And he cries out, "Wretched man that I am!"
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.560]   And then he flies to Christ for cleansing.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:21.640]   I don't think we can, as much as I would like it for my own soul, I don't think we can provide
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:31.400]   a list of sins or a number for the frequency with which you can sin and get away with it.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   I don't think we can do that in a way that answers the question, "How much sinning proves
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   that I'm not a Christian?"
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:51.160]   Instead, I would say this, to the degree that your confessing of sin has made a kind of
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:59.520]   fatalistic peace with sin's inevitability, and to the degree that your sin falls into
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:08.120]   the category of premeditated unrighteousness, to that degree, you should be frightened that
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.560]   you are on a path that may well lead to destruction.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.920]   I think that's what we can say.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.760]   The book in the New Testament, interestingly enough, paradoxically enough, the book in
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:29.480]   the New Testament that is perhaps the hardest on Christians' sinning is the same book that
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.520]   warns most explicitly about the dangers of perfectionism.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:41.680]   So let me close by reading that paradoxical section from 1 John 1, 8 to 10.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.920]   This is the way the Bible chooses to talk about this paradox.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:54.320]   If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   So that's the warning against perfectionism.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.360]   And then he continues, "If we confess our sins," and that confession right there, I
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   think, means real.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:13.120]   He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.280]   And then he goes back to the warning.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:25.560]   If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   That's really great.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   Thank you.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   And great point on 1 John as well.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.260]   The same book that is hardest on Christians' sinning is the same book that warns most explicitly
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.760]   about the dangers of perfectionism.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.080]   That is a great point.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.640]   Thank you, as always, Pastor John, for that.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.800]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:49.160]   You can search on our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast, all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.960]   Well does God detest Africa?
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.760]   It's a stark question that comes to us from inside the continent.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.480]   Doesn't the long track record of providence show that God does not care so much for Africa,
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.880]   a continent that's constantly riddled with disease, famine, and suffering?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   How can we not conclude that Africans are God's least favorite race?
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   And that is a stark question.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.120]   It's a good one, though.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.480]   And it'll give us an opportunity to look at the global church and what God is doing around
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   the world.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   That's up next time.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.360]   We'll see you then.
