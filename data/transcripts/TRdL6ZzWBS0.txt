[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   The following is a conversation with Jed Buchwald,
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.480]   a professor of history and a philosopher of science
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.720]   at Caltech, interested especially in the development
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.320]   of scientific concepts and the instruments used to create
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   and explore new effects and ideas in science.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.040]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.160]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.840]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   and here is my conversation with Jed Buchwald.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.440]   Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.220]   as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.920]   or does it progress gradually?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.320]   What do you think?
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.640]   - Well, I got into this field
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.480]   'cause I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.120]   52 years ago. - Wow.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.640]   - He pulled me into it out of physics instead.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   So I know his work pretty well,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.520]   and in the years when I was at MIT running an institute,
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.720]   he was then in the philosophy department,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   used to come over all the time
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.680]   to the talks we held and so on.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800]   So what would I say about that?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.520]   He, of course, developed his ideas a lot over the years.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.400]   The thing that he's famous for,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   the structure of scientific revolutions, came out in '62.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.760]   And as you just said, it offered an outline
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600]   for what he called a paradigmatic structure,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.840]   namely the notion that you have to look
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.360]   at what scientists do as forming a community
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   of investigators, and that they're trying
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   to solve various puzzles, as he would put it,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.720]   that crop up, figuring out how this works,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.520]   how that works, and so on.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   And of course, they don't do it out of the blue.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.260]   They do it within a certain framework.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.280]   The framework can be pretty vague.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.160]   He called it a paradigm.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.760]   And his notion was that eventually,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.360]   they run into troubles, or what he called anomalies,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.320]   that kind of cracks things.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.360]   Somebody new comes along
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   with a different way of doing it, et cetera.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.480]   Do I think things work that way?
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.620]   No, not really.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.160]   Tom and I used to have lengthy discussions
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.700]   about that over the years.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.600]   I do think there is a common structure
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.920]   that formulates both theoretical
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.520]   and experimental practices.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.440]   And historians nowadays of science
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.800]   like to refer to scientific work
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840]   as what scientists practice.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.200]   It's almost craftsman-like.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.480]   They can usually adapt in various ways.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.000]   And I can give you all kinds of examples of that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   I once wrote a book on the origins
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.740]   of wave theory of light, and that is one
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.160]   of the paradigmatic examples that Tom used,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.480]   only it didn't work that way exactly.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.960]   Because he thought that what happened was
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.160]   that the wave theory ran into trouble
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.800]   with a certain phenomenon which it couldn't crack.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.640]   Well, it turned out that, in fact,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.560]   historically, that phenomenon was actually
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.120]   not relevant later on to the wave theory.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.700]   And when the wave theory came in,
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.780]   the alternative to it which had prevailed,
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.560]   which was Newton's views of light as particles,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.440]   that, it seemed, couldn't explain
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   what the wave theory could explain.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.900]   Again, not true.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.320]   Not true.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.840]   Much more complex than that.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   The wave theory offered the opportunity
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   to deploy novel experimental and mathematical structures
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.080]   which gave younger scientists, mathematicians and others,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.900]   the opportunity to effect, manufacture,
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.260]   make new sorts of devices.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.060]   It's not that the alternative couldn't
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.420]   sort of explain these things,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.620]   but it never was able to generate them de novo,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.060]   as novelties.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.300]   In other words, if you think of it
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.740]   as something scientists wanted to progress
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.300]   in the sense of finding new stuff to solve,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   then I think what often happens is
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.260]   that it's not so much that the prevailing view
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.420]   can't crack something as that it doesn't give you
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.340]   the opportunity to do new stuff.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.340]   - When you say new stuff,
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.780]   are we referring to experimental science here
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.900]   or new stuff in the space of new theories?
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   - Could be both.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.980]   Could be both, actually.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.780]   - So how does that, can you maybe elaborate
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.820]   a little bit on the story of the wave view?
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.660]   - Sure.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860]   The prevailing view of light, at least in France,
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.240]   where the wave theory really first took off,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.400]   although it had been introduced in England by Thomas Young,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.140]   the prevailing theory dates back to Newton,
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.720]   that light is a stream of particles,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.660]   and that refraction and reflection
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.420]   involve sort of repulsive and attractive forces
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.000]   that deflect and bend the paths of these particles.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.060]   Newton was not able successfully to deal with
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.140]   the phenomenon of what happens when light
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.100]   goes past a knife's edge or a sharp edge,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.580]   what we now call diffraction.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.860]   He had cooked up something about it
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.420]   that no mathematical structure could be applied.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.640]   Thomas Young first, but really this guy named
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.640]   Augustin Fresnel in France, deployed, in Fresnel's case,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.940]   rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.240]   which enabled computations to be done
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.500]   and observations to be melded with these computations
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.900]   in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.800]   Did that mean that the Newtonian explanation
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.720]   of what goes on in diffraction fails?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.900]   Not really.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.020]   You can actually make it work,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.160]   but you can't generate anything new out of it.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.080]   Whereas, using the mathematics of wave optics
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.320]   in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   which ironically was discovered by partisans
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.640]   of Newton's way of doing things,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.360]   you were able to generate devices
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.160]   which reflect light and crystals, do various things,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.600]   that the Newtonian way could accommodate
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.840]   only after the fact.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.400]   They couldn't generate it from the beginning.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.360]   And so, if you want to be somebody
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.480]   who is working a novel vein,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.360]   which increasingly becomes the case
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   with people who become what we now call physicists
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.900]   in the 1820s, '30s, and '40s in particular,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.900]   then that's the direction you're gonna go.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.440]   But there were holdouts until the 1850s.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   - I wanna try to elaborate on the nature
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.320]   of the disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.800]   So, do you still believe in paradigm shifts?
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.440]   Do you still see that there's ideas
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.800]   that really have a transformational effect on science?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.760]   The nature of the disagreement has to do
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.580]   with how those paradigm shifts come to be?
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.240]   - How they come to be and how they change.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.640]   I certainly think they exist.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.280]   How strong they may be at any given time
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   is maybe not quite as powerful as Tom thought in general.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.920]   Although, towards the end of his life,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.760]   he was beginning to develop different modifications
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.080]   of his original way of thinking.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.240]   But I don't think that the changes happened
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.600]   quite so neatly, if you will,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.400]   in reaction to novel experimental observations.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   They can be much more complex than that.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.720]   - In terms of neatness,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   how much of science progresses by individual lone geniuses
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.240]   and how much by the messy collaboration
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   of competing and cooperating humans?
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.680]   - I don't think you can cut that with a knife
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.000]   to say it's this percent and that percent.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It's almost always the case that there are one or two
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   or maybe three individuals who are sort of central
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.980]   to what goes on when things begin to shift.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:40.240]   Are they inevitably and solely responsible
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.240]   for what then begins to happen in a major way?
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.120]   I think not.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.960]   It depends.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.060]   You can go very far back with this,
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.120]   even into antiquity, to see what goes on.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.600]   The major locus we always talk about from the beginning
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.620]   is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.040]   for example, were there ways of accommodating it
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.260]   that others could adapt to
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.420]   without buying into the whole scheme?
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.260]   Yes.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.960]   Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.100]   because you could also do other things with it
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.260]   that you couldn't otherwise do?
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.700]   Also yes.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.300]   Let me give you an example.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.060]   The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.900]   who was a mechanical philosopher,
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.460]   he believed the world was matter in motion,
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.020]   he never thought much of what Galileo had done
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.580]   in respect to motion because he thought,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.160]   well, at best it's some sort of approximative scheme
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.940]   or something like that.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.940]   But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.220]   but follower who then broke with him in a number of ways,
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.500]   was a man named Christian Huygens,
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.980]   who was, along with Newton,
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.220]   one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.060]   Huygens is older than Newton.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.060]   And Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.940]   in respect to motion to develop all sorts of things,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.680]   including the first pendulum-governed clock,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.480]   and even figured out how to build one
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.760]   which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.240]   But he had the mathematical structure for it.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.560]   - How well known is Huygens?
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   - Oh, very well known.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.200]   - Should I know him well?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.480]   - Yes, you should.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.360]   - Interesting.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.720]   - You should definitely know him well.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.960]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.920]   Can we define should here?
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.760]   - Okay.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   - Because I don't.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.520]   - Right.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.240]   - Yeah, can you define should?
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.700]   - Should means this.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.840]   If you had taken up to a second year of physics courses,
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.360]   you should, you would have heard his name
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.960]   because one of the fundamental principles in optics
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.040]   is called Huygens' principle.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.400]   - Okay. - Okay?
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   - Yeah, so I have, and I have heard his name.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.000]   - There you go.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.840]   - No, but I don't remember.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.880]   - But you don't remember.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.560]   - So I mean, there's a very different thing
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.760]   between names attached to principles and laws and so on
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.240]   that you sometimes let go of,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.640]   you just remember the equations of the principles themselves
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.800]   and the personalities of science.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.720]   And there's certain personalities,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.480]   certain human beings that stand out.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.920]   And that's why there's a sense to which the lone inventor,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.520]   the lone scientist is the way I personally,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   I mean, I think a lot of people think about
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.740]   the history of science is these lone geniuses.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.560]   Without them, the sense is,
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.800]   if you remove Newton from the picture,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.440]   if you remove Galileo from the picture,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.600]   then science would, there's almost a feeling like
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.000]   it would just have stopped there.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.680]   Or at the very least, there's a feeling like
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.320]   it would take much longer to develop
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.400]   the things that were developed.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   Is that a silly way to look at the history of science?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.620]   - That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:12.160]   I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not existed
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.500]   given the context of the time,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.800]   what was floating around in the belief structure
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.880]   concerning the nature of the world and so on,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.240]   the developments in mathematics and whatnot,
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.400]   that sooner or later,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.540]   whether it would have been exactly the same or not,
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.880]   I cannot say, but would things have evolved?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.720]   Yes.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.480]   - If we look at the long arc of history of science
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.640]   from back when we were in the caves
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.240]   trying to knock two rocks together
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:01.120]   or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   many centuries from now,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.400]   when human civilization finally destroys itself.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.820]   If we look at that history,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.340]   and imagine you're a historian at the end,
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.120]   like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.240]   and you look back at this time in the 21st century,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.440]   how far along are we on that arc?
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.120]   Do you sense?
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.080]   Have we invented and discovered everything
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.840]   that's to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%?
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.900]   - (laughs) Well--
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.600]   - You're gonna get a lot of absurd questions today.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.560]   I apologize.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.040]   - It's a lugubrious picture you're painting there.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.280]   - I don't even know what the word lugubrious means,
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   but I love it.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.960]   (laughs)
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.780]   Lugubrious.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.680]   - Well, let me try and separate the question
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.320]   of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.000]   in several hundred years or not
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.840]   from the question of where science may be sitting.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.760]   - Take that as an assumption.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   - Okay.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.840]   I find that hard to say.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480]   And I find it hard to say
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.800]   because in the deepest sense of the term,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.000]   as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.100]   I'm not fundamentally a realist.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.360]   That is to say, I think our access
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.140]   to the inner workings of nature
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.060]   is inevitably mediated by what we can do
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.680]   with the materials and factors around us.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.480]   We can probe things in various ways.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.800]   Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.860]   in quantum electrodynamics is incorrect?
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.320]   Of course not.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.520]   I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.820]   It can do a lot,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.220]   especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.820]   in very large, expensive particle accelerators
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.680]   and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.740]   Do I think that we have inevitably probed
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.180]   the depths of reality through this?
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.180]   I do not agree with Steven Weinberg,
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.140]   who thinks we have, about such things.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.320]   Do I, on the other hand, think that the way
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.020]   in which science has been moving for the last 100 years,
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.820]   physics in particular is what I have in mind,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.740]   will continue on the same course?
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.300]   In that sense, I don't,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.940]   because we're not going to be building bigger and bigger
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.920]   and more and more expensive machines
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.480]   to rip apart particles in various ways.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.120]   In which case, what are physicists gonna do?
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.760]   They'll turn their attention to other aspects.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.640]   There are all sorts of things we've never explained.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.960]   About the material world, we don't have theories
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.580]   that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.300]   We can, can we, for example, start with the standard model
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.460]   and work our way up all the way to chemical transformations?
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.840]   You can make an argument about it,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.420]   and you can justify things, but that's in chemistry,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.480]   that's not the way people work.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.900]   They work with much higher level
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.980]   quantum mechanical relationships and so on.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.220]   So this notion of the deep theory to explain everything
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:33.220]   is a longstanding belief,
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.140]   which goes back pretty far,
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.180]   although I think it only takes its fullest form
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.200]   sometime in towards the end of the 19th century.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.940]   - So maybe we just speak to that,
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.140]   you're referring to a hope, a dream,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.500]   a reality of coming up with a theory of everything
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.180]   that explains everything.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.120]   So there's a very specific thing
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.540]   that that currently means in physics,
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.300]   is the unification of the laws of physics.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.860]   But I'm sure in antiquity or before,
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.260]   it meant maybe something else,
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.940]   or is it always about physics?
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.000]   'Cause I mean, I think as you've kind of implied,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.300]   in physics there's a sense
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.740]   once you get to the theory of everything,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.460]   you've understood everything.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.980]   But there's a very deep sense
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.600]   in which you've actually understood not very much at all.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.980]   You've understood at that particular level how things work,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.140]   but you don't understand how the abstractions
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.960]   on top of abstractions form,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.920]   all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.140]   and the human societies, and all those kinds of things.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.500]   So maybe you can speak to the theory of everything
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.460]   and its history, and comment on what the heck
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.740]   does that even mean, a theory of everything.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.540]   - Well, I don't think you can go back that far
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.660]   with something like that.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.500]   Maybe to the, at best to the 17th century.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.300]   If you go back all the way in antiquity,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   there are of course discussions
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.140]   about the nature of the world.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.140]   But first of all, you have to recognize
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:10.700]   that the manipulative character of physics and chemistry,
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.380]   the probing of, let me put it this way.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.060]   We assume, and have assumed for a long time,
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.300]   I'll come back to when in a moment,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.480]   that if I take a little device,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.040]   which is really complicatedly made,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.940]   out of all kinds of things,
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.340]   and I put a piece of some material in it,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.340]   and I monkey around with it,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.100]   and do all kinds of unnatural things to it,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.780]   things that wouldn't happen naturally,
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.820]   and I find out how it behaves and whatnot,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.900]   and then I try and make an argument
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.240]   about how that really applies,
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.660]   even in the natural world
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.380]   without any artificial structures and so on,
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.020]   that's not a belief that was widely held
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.020]   by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe in the 1500s.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.240]   And when it was first held,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.020]   it was held by people we now call alchemists.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.540]   So alchemy was the first,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.340]   the early days of the theory of everything,
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.120]   of a dream of a theory of everything.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.900]   I would put it a little differently.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.600]   I think it's more along the way,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.940]   a dream that by probing nature
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.420]   in artificially constructed ways,
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.460]   we can find out what's going on deep down there.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:37.740]   - So that's distinct from science being an observing thing,
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.860]   where you observe nature and you study nature.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.500]   You're talking about probing,
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.660]   like messing with nature to understand it.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.700]   - Indeed I am.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.620]   But that of course is the very essence
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.400]   of experimental science.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.280]   You have to manipulate nature
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.400]   to find out things about it.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.920]   And then you have to convince others
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.120]   that you haven't so manipulated it
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.300]   that what you've done is to produce
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.080]   what amounts to fake, artifactual behavior
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.880]   that doesn't really hold purely naturally.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.920]   - So where are we today in your sense
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.280]   to jump around a little bit with the theory of everything?
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.640]   Maybe a quick kind of sense you have
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.680]   about the journey in the world of physics
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.800]   that we're taking towards the theory of everything.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.940]   - Well, I'm of course not a practicing physicist.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.720]   I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.000]   a long time ago.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   - Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.400]   - More or less.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.320]   I was taking graduate courses
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.120]   in those days in general relativity.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.200]   I was an undergraduate,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.000]   but I moved up and then I took a course with him.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.280]   - Well, you made the mistake of being compelled
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.400]   by charismatic philosophers and never looked back.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.040]   - I suppose so in a way.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.340]   And from what I understand,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.520]   talking especially to my friends at Caltech,
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.880]   like Kip Thorne and others,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   the fundamental notion is that actually the laws
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:21.200]   that even at the deepest level we can sort of divine
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.480]   and work with in the universe that we inhabit
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.380]   are perhaps quite unique to this particular universe
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.260]   as it formed at the Big Bang.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:38.520]   The question is, how deep does it go?
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.080]   If you are very mathematically inclined,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.960]   the prevailing notion for several decades now
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.980]   has been what's called string theory,
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.520]   but that has not been able to figure a way
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.840]   to generate probative experimental evidence,
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.100]   although it's pretty good apparently at accommodating things.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.800]   And then the question is, what's before the Big Bang?
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.320]   Or actually the word before doesn't mean anything
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.680]   given the nature of time,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   but why do we have the laws that prevail in our universe?
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:23.960]   Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   in our universe because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.760]   (laughs)
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.000]   - That's a bit of a cyclical,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.800]   but nevertheless a compelling definition.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.160]   And there's all kinds of things
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.760]   like it seems like the unification of those laws
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.200]   could be discovered by looking inside of a black hole
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.080]   'cause you get both the general relativity
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.280]   and the quantum mechanics, quantum field theory in there.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.600]   Experimentally, of course,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.040]   there's a lot of interesting ideas.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.360]   We can't really look close to the Big Bang,
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   can't look that far back.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.720]   There's Caltech and MIT will let go,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.280]   look at gravitational waves,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.160]   perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   Yeah, it's a really exciting space.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.000]   And there's, of course, the theory of everything
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.440]   like with a lot of things in science
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.080]   captivates the dreams of those
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.680]   who are perhaps completely outside of science.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.840]   It's the dream of discovering the key
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.580]   to how the nature of how everything works.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.640]   And that feels deeply human.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.800]   That's perhaps the thing,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.600]   the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in the end
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.740]   is that curiosity, that longing to understand.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.760]   Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.020]   with Weinberg on reality.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.760]   Could you elaborate a little bit?
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.440]   - Well, obviously I don't disagree
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.360]   with Steve Weinberg on physics itself.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.680]   I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.720]   And clearly, he's one of the founders
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.920]   of the standard model and so on,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.800]   and it works to a level of accuracy
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.620]   that no physical theory has ever worked at before.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:11.860]   I suppose the question in my mind is something that
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.760]   in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.120]   in the 18th century,
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   namely, can we really ever convince ourselves
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.120]   that we have come to grips with something
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   that is not in itself knowable to us by our senses
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:41.240]   or even except in the most remote way
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.560]   through the complex instruments that we make
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.320]   as to what it is that underlies everything.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.640]   Can we corral it with mathematics
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.280]   and experimental structures?
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.120]   Yes.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.880]   Do I think that a particular way of corralling nature
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.080]   will inevitably play itself out?
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.520]   I don't know.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.160]   It always has.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.660]   I'll put it to you that way.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:13.520]   - So the basic question is, can we know reality?
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.860]   Is that the Kant question?
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.140]   Is that the Weinberg question?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   We humans with our brains, can we comprehend reality?
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.220]   Sounds like a very trippy question
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.420]   'cause a lot of it rests on definitions of know
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.580]   and comprehend and reality, but get to the bottom of it.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.980]   Turtles on top of turtles, can we get to the bottom turtle?
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.720]   - Well-- - And say hello.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.000]   - Maybe I can put it to you this way.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   In a way that I often begin discussions in a class
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.680]   on the history of science and so on
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.780]   and say I'm looking at you.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.620]   - Yes.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.260]   - You are in fact a figment of my imagination.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.900]   - You have a messed up imagination, yes.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.560]   - Well, what do I mean by that?
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.960]   If I were a dragonfly looking at you,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.980]   whatever my nervous system would form
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.040]   by way of a perceptual structure
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.620]   would clearly be utterly different
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.620]   from what my brain and perceptual system altogether
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.900]   is forming when I look at you.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.840]   Who's right?
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.460]   Who?
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.740]   Is it me or the dragonfly?
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:56.420]   - Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.180]   so I don't know, but yes, the observer matters.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.620]   - Well-- - What is that supposed
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.760]   to tell us about objective reality?
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.940]   - Well, I think it means that it's very difficult
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.940]   to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual system
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.640]   is leading us to.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.340]   When we make apparatus and devices and so on,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.840]   we're still making things, the results of which
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.180]   or the outputs of which we process perceptually
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.780]   in various ways.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.720]   And an analogy I like to use with students sometimes
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.360]   is this, all right, they all have their laptops open
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.500]   in front of them, of course, okay?
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.460]   And I've sent them something to read.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.140]   And I say, okay, click on it and open it up.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.620]   So PDF opens up.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.700]   I said, what are you looking at?
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.140]   They said, well, I'm looking at the paper that you sent me.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.140]   I said, no, you're not.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.780]   What you're looking at is a stream of light
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.780]   And I said, what happens when you use your mouse
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.320]   and move that fake piece of paper on the screen around?
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.360]   What are you doing?
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.500]   You're not moving a piece of paper around, are you?
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.340]   You're moving a construct around,
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.900]   a construct that's being processed
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.660]   so that our perceptual system can interact with it
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.940]   in the way we interact with pieces of paper.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.240]   But it's not real.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:39.200]   - So are there things outside of the reach of science?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   Can you maybe, as an example, talk about consciousness?
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.060]   I'm asking for a friend, trying to figure this thing out.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.920]   - Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit about that,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.640]   but I certainly can't really say much about it.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.400]   I don't think there is anything out there
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   except material structures which interact in various ways.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.720]   Do I think, for example,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.280]   that this bottle of water is conscious?
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.460]   No, I do not.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.240]   Although, how would I know?
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.120]   I can't talk to it.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.640]   But, so what do--
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.000]   - It's a hypothesis you have.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.440]   It's an opinion, an educated opinion that may be very wrong.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.880]   - Well, I know that you're conscious
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.400]   because I can interact directly with you.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.760]   But am I?
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.200]   - Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.480]   - No, or I'm a robot that's able to generate the illusion.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.320]   - Yes.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.480]   - The illusion of consciousness effectively enough
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.400]   to facilitate a good conversation.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.040]   'Cause we humans do want to pretend
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.720]   that we're talking to other conscious beings
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.920]   'cause that's how we respect them.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   If it's not conscious, we don't respect them.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.520]   We're not good at talking to robots.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.360]   - That's true.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.680]   Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense,
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.040]   which is the kind of thing Descartes said
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.280]   from the beginning.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.640]   We generalize from that.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.640]   But I do think that consciousness must be something,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.680]   whatever it is, that occurs as a result
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.480]   of some particular organizational structure
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.920]   of material elements.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.520]   - Does materialism mean that it's all
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.060]   within the reach of science?
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:33.120]   - My sense would be that, especially as neuroscience,
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   progresses more and more.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.320]   And at Caltech, we just built a whole neuroscience arena
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.280]   and so on.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.720]   And as more knowledge is gained about the ways
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.620]   in which animals, when they behave,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.680]   what patterns show up at various parts of the brain
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   and nervous system, and perhaps extending it
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.640]   to humans eventually as well,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   we'll get more of a handle on what brain activity
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.680]   is associated with experiences that we have as humans.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:18.800]   Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.940]   in terms of our, no, you can't.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.520]   Perception is perception.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.520]   - That's a hypothesis once again.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   - Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.440]   that's yet to be discovered.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.840]   Maybe it permeates all matter.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.800]   Maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.720]   and plug into the ability to generate
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.460]   and control that kind of law of physics
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.120]   that would crack open, or we would understand
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.760]   that the bottle of water is in fact conscious,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.020]   just much less conscious than us humans.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.840]   And then we would be able to then generate
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.400]   beings that are more conscious.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   - Well, that'll be unfortunate.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.440]   I'd have to stop drinking the water after that.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.640]   - Every time you take a sip,
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.440]   there's a little bit of a suffering going on.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.360]   - Right.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   - What to use the most interesting, beautiful moments
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.600]   in the history of science?
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   What stands out?
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.320]   And then we can pull at that thread.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.340]   - Right.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.960]   Well, I like to think of events that have
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.540]   a major impact and involve both beautiful,
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.960]   conceptual, mathematical,
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.220]   if we're talking physical structures work,
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.180]   and are associated as well
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.720]   with probing experimental situations.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.640]   So among my favorites is one of the most famous,
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.840]   which was the young Isaac Newton's work
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.680]   with the colors produced
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.780]   when you pass sunlight through a prism.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.880]   And why do I like that?
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.000]   It's not profoundly mathematical in one sense,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.880]   doesn't need it initially.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.760]   It needs the following though,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.620]   which begins to show you, I think,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.660]   a little bit about what gets involved
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.200]   when you've got a smart individual
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   who's trying to monkey around with stuff
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.180]   and finds new things about it.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.200]   First, let me say that the notion,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.660]   the prevailing notion going back to antiquity,
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.560]   was that colors are produced in a sense
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.400]   by modifying or tinting white light,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.240]   that they're modifications of white light.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.660]   In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.520]   in any way, okay?
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.160]   Now, what Newton did following experiments
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.840]   done by Descartes before him,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.120]   who came to very different conclusions,
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.560]   he took a prism, you might ask,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.000]   where do you get prisms in the 1660s?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.720]   - That's a good question.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.040]   - County fairs, they were very popular.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.200]   but they produced colors,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.320]   so you could buy them at county fairs and things,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.200]   very popular.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.480]   - Oh, so they were modifying the white light
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   to create colors.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.520]   - Well, they were creating colors from it, well known.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.280]   And what he did was the following.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.520]   He was by this time, even though he's very young,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.960]   a very good mathematician.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.520]   And he could use the then known laws
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.640]   for how light behaves when it goes through glass
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.080]   to calculate what should happen
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.200]   if you took light from the sun,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.680]   passed it from a hole through a little hole,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.840]   then hit the prism, goes out of the prism,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.200]   goes, strikes a wall a long distance away,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.760]   and makes a splash of light.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   Nevermind the colors for a moment,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.440]   makes a splash of light there.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.120]   He was very smart.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.700]   First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves,
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.760]   even though that's what everybody's
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.400]   paying attention to initially.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.800]   And 'cause what he knows is this.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.400]   He knows that if you take this prism
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.220]   and you turn it to a certain particular angle,
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.800]   that he knew what it should be
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.880]   'cause he could calculate things.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.160]   Very few other people in Europe at the time
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.080]   could calculate things like he could.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.680]   That if you turn the prism to that particular angle,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.560]   then the sun, which is of course a circle,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.920]   when its light passes through this little hole
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.500]   and then into the prism,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.880]   on the far distant wall should still make a circle.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.580]   But it doesn't.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.000]   It makes a very long image, okay?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.960]   And this led him to a very different conception
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.760]   of light indicating that there are different types
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.560]   of light in the sunlight.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   Now, to go beyond that,
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.720]   what's particularly interesting I think is the following.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.880]   When he published this paper,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.280]   which got him into a controversy,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.840]   he really didn't describe at all what he did.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.380]   He just gave you some numbers.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.520]   Now, I just told you that you had to set this prism
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.180]   at a certain angle, right?
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.220]   You would think, 'cause we do have his notes and so on,
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.980]   you would think that he took some kind of complicated
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.180]   measuring device to set the prism.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.340]   He didn't.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.460]   He held it in his hand, that's all.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.580]   And he twiddled it around.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.460]   And what was he doing?
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.420]   It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.540]   at the point where you should get a circle from a circle,
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.140]   it also is the place where the image
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.460]   does not move very fast.
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.160]   So if you wanna get close to there, you just twiddle it.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.020]   This is manipulative experimentation,
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.940]   taking advantage through his mathematical knowledge
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.340]   of the inherent inaccuracies that let you come
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.860]   to exact conclusions,
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   regardless of the built-in problematics of measurement.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.740]   He's the only one I know of doing anything like that
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:12.700]   at the time. - At the time.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.940]   - Yeah.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.980]   - Well, even still, there's very few people
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.040]   that are able to calculate as well as he did
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.740]   to be a theoretician and an experimentalist,
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.240]   like in the same moment.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.460]   (laughs)
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.460]   Right?
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.460]   - It's true, although until really the,
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.780]   well into the 20th century,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.940]   maybe the beginning of the 20th century,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   really most of the most significant experimental results
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.620]   produced in the 1800s,
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.740]   which laid the foundations for light, electricity,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.800]   electrodynamics, and so on,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.220]   even hydrodynamics and whatnot,
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.960]   were also produced by people who are both
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.340]   excellent calculators,
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.540]   very talented mathematicians,
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.600]   and good with their hands experimentally.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.580]   - And then that led to the 21st century
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.860]   with Enrico Fermi,
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   that one of the last people that was able to do that,
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.120]   both of those things very well,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   and that he built a little device called an atomic bomb
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.220]   that has some positives and negatives.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.820]   - Yeah, well, right, of course,
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.180]   that actually did involve some pretty large-scale,
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.660]   elaborate equipment too.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.900]   - Yeah, well, holding a prism in your hands, same thing.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.940]   - Right, no.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.780]   - What's the controversy that Newton got into
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.760]   with that paper when he published it?
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.220]   - Well, in a number of ways,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.140]   it's a complicated story.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:56.140]   There was a very talented character known as a mechanic.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.700]   Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.020]   who could build and make really good stuff,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.380]   and he was very talented.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.180]   His name was Robert Hooke,
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.180]   and he was the guy who,
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.380]   at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London,
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.500]   and Newton's not in London,
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.140]   you know, he's at Cambridge, he's a young guy,
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.100]   he would demonstrate new things,
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.220]   and he was very clever.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.380]   And he had written a book, in fact,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.940]   called "The Micrographia,"
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.980]   which, by the way, he used a microscope
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:30.140]   to make the first depictions of things like a fly's eye,
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.540]   the structure of, you know, it had a big influence.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.140]   And in there, he also talked about light.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.820]   And so he had a different view of light.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.660]   And when he read what Newton wrote,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.300]   he had a double reaction.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.580]   On the one hand, he said,
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.140]   "Anything in there that is correct, I already knew.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.940]   "And anything that I didn't already know
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.060]   "is probably not right anyway."
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.500]   (Luke laughs)
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.380]   - Ah, gotta love egos.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.940]   Okay, can we just step back?
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.460]   Can you say, who was Isaac Newton?
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.380]   What are the things he contributed to this world
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.860]   in the space of ideas?
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.060]   - Wow. (laughs)
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.580]   Who was he?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.580]   He was born in 1642,
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.700]   and near the small town of Grantham in England.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.220]   In fact, the house he was born in,
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.740]   and that his mother died in,
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.580]   is still there and can be visited.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.300]   His father died before he was born.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.700]   And his mother eventually remarried
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.180]   a man named Reverend Smith,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.820]   whom Newton did not like at all,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:52.180]   because Reverend Smith took his mother away
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.420]   to live with him a few miles away,
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.900]   leaving Newton to be brought up
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.740]   more or less by his grandmother over there.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.100]   And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.020]   - I think that gives you a little inkling
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.540]   that a little bit of trauma in childhood,
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.940]   maybe a complicated father-son relationship
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.100]   can be useful to create a good scientist.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.740]   - Could be, although this case it would be right,
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:20.660]   the absent father, non-father relationship, so to speak.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.500]   He was known as a kid, little that we do know,
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.460]   for being very clever about flying kites
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.380]   and there are stories about him putting candles
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.180]   and flying kites and scaring the living devil
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.220]   out of people at night by doing that and things like that.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:44.220]   Making things, most of the physicists
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.820]   and natural philosophers I've dealt with
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.160]   actually as children were very fond of making
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.860]   and playing with things.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.140]   I can't think of one I know of who wasn't actually.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.980]   They're very good with their hands and whatnot.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:04.820]   He was, his mother wanted him to take over the manor.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.180]   It was a kind of farming manor.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.220]   They were the class of what are known as yeomans.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.500]   There are stories that he wasn't very good at that.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.620]   One day, one of the stories is he's sitting out in the field
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.060]   and the cows come home without him
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.440]   and he doesn't know what's going, anyway.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.660]   He had relatives and he manages to get to Cambridge,
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.180]   sent to Cambridge 'cause he's known to be smart.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.420]   He's read books that he got from local dignitaries
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.480]   and some relatives and he goes there
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.100]   as what's known as a subsizer.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.260]   What does that mean?
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.480]   Well, it's not too pleasant.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.260]   Basically, a subsizer was a student
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.860]   who had to clean the bedpans of the richer kids.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.280]   - Okay. - Right?
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.180]   That didn't last too long.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.940]   He makes his way and he becomes absorbed
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.480]   in some of the new ways of thinking
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.300]   that are being talked about on the parts of Descartes
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.280]   and others as well.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.740]   There's also the traditional curriculum which he follows
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.560]   and we have his notes.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.980]   We have his student notebooks and so on.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.820]   We can see gradually this young man's mind
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.100]   focusing and coming to grips with deeper questions
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.500]   of the nature of the world and perception even
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.900]   and how we know things and also probing
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.580]   and learning mathematical structures to such an extent
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.440]   that he builds on some of the investigations
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.420]   that had been done in the period before him
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.580]   to create the foundations of a way of investigating
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.900]   processes that happen and change continuously
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.660]   instead of by leaps and bounds and so on,
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.580]   forming the foundation of what we now call the calculus.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.500]   - Yeah.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.180]   So can you maybe just paint a little bit of a picture,
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:02.180]   you've already started, of what were the things
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.140]   that bothered him the most, that stood out to him
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:10.260]   the most about the traditional curriculum,
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.340]   about the way people saw the world?
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.700]   You mentioned discrete versus continuous.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.740]   Is there something where he began thinking
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.540]   in a revolutionary way?
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.820]   'Cause it's fascinating.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.460]   Most of us go to college, Cambridge or otherwise,
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:29.460]   and we just kind of take what we hear as gospel, right?
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.600]   Like not gospel, but as like facts.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.660]   You don't begin to sort of see how can I expand
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.260]   on this aggressively or how can I challenge everything
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.860]   that I hear, like rigorously, mathematically,
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.700]   through the, I mean, I don't even know how rigorous
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.220]   the mathematics was at that point.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.680]   I'm sure it was geometry and so on, no calculus, huh?
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.620]   - There are elements of what turned into the calculus
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.700]   that predate Newton, but--
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.140]   - How much rigor was there?
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.180]   How much--
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.900]   - Well, rigor, no.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.860]   - And then, of course, no scientific method, not really.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.420]   I mean, somewhat, I mean, appreciation of data.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.300]   - Ah, that is a separate question
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.860]   from a question of method.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.020]   Appreciation of data is a significant question
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.380]   as to what you do with data.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.300]   There's lots of things you're asking.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.140]   - I apologize.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.020]   So maybe let's backtrack, and the first question is
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.100]   was there something that was bothering him
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.440]   that he especially thought he could contribute or work on?
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.140]   - Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him,
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.500]   but we do have these student notebooks.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.900]   There's two of them.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.300]   One's called the philosophical questions,
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.420]   and the other is called the waste book.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.960]   The philosophical questions has discussions
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.460]   of the nature of reality and various issues concerning it,
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.300]   and the waste book has things that have to do with motion
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.260]   in various ways, what happens in collisions
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.920]   and things of that sort, and it's a complicated story,
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.460]   but what's among the things that I think are interesting
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.740]   is he took notes in the philosophical questions
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.740]   on stuff that was traditionally given to you
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.880]   in the curriculums going back several hundred years,
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.880]   namely on what scholars refer to as scholastic
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.420]   or neo-scholastic ways of thinking about the world
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.300]   dating back to the reformulation of Aristotle
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.300]   in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas in the church,
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.700]   and this is a totally different way
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.860]   of thinking about things, which actually connects
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   to something we were saying a moment ago.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.620]   For instance, so I'm wearing a blue shirt,
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:48.920]   and I will sometimes ask students, where is the blue?
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.260]   And they'll usually say, well, it's in your shirt,
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.980]   and then some of them get clearer, and they say,
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.420]   well, no, you know, light is striking it,
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.740]   photons are re-emitted, they strike the back of your retina,
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.340]   and et cetera, et cetera, and I said, yes.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.420]   You, what that means is that the blue
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:10.140]   is actually an artifact of our perceptual system
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.820]   considered as the percept of blue.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:18.180]   It's not out there, it's in here, right?
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.060]   That's not how things were thought about
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.080]   well into the 16th century.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.520]   The general notion dating back
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.020]   even to Aristotelian antiquity
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.500]   and formalized by the 12th century
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.580]   at Paris, Oxford, and elsewhere
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.480]   is that qualities are there in the world.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.520]   They're not in us.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.060]   We have senses, and our senses can be wrong.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:49.940]   You know, you could go blind, things like that,
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.500]   but if they're working properly,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.620]   you get the actual qualities of the world.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.180]   Now that break, which is occurring
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.980]   towards the end of the 16th century
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.860]   and is most visible in Descartes,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.400]   is the break between conceiving
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.940]   that the qualities of the world
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.900]   are very different from the qualities that we perceive,
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.060]   that in fact, the qualities of the world
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   consist almost entirely in shapes of various kinds
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.180]   and maybe hard particles or whatever,
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   but not colors, not sounds, not smells,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.500]   not softness and hardness.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.740]   They're not in the world.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.720]   They're in us.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.960]   That break, Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.400]   He's gonna disagree with a lot in Descartes,
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.540]   but that break, he is, among other things,
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.460]   picking up very strongly,
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:54.920]   and that underlies a lot of the way he works later on
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.460]   when he becomes skeptical of the evidence
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.460]   provided by the senses.
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.020]   - Yeah, that's actually, I don't know,
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.220]   the way you're describing it is so powerful.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.740]   It just makes me realize how liberating that is
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.060]   as a scientist, as somebody who's trying
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.460]   to understand reality,
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.880]   that our senses is just,
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.700]   our senses are not to be trusted,
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.540]   that reality is to be investigated
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.860]   through tools that are beyond our senses.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.420]   - Yes.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.940]   - Or that improve our senses.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.580]   - Or improve our senses.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.640]   - In some ways.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.700]   - That's pretty powerful.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.120]   I mean, that is, for a human being,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.140]   that's like Einstein level.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:48.660]   For a human being to realize I can't trust my own senses
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.000]   at that time, that's pretty trippy.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.700]   - It's coming in, it's coming in,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   and I think it arises probably a fair number
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.040]   of decades before that, perhaps in part
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.660]   with all chemical experimentation and manipulations
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.400]   that you have to go through elaborate structures
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.320]   to produce things and ways you think about it.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.440]   But let me give you an example that I think
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.180]   you might find interesting because it's from,
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.060]   it involves that guy named Hook
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.980]   that Newton had an argument with.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:28.020]   And he had lots of arguments with Hook,
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.980]   although Hook was a very clever guy
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.940]   and gave him some things that stimulated him later.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:37.060]   Anyway, Hook, who was argumentative,
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.480]   and he really was convinced that the only way
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.140]   to gain real knowledge of nature
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:48.100]   is through carefully constructed devices.
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.860]   And he was an expert mechanic, if you will,
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.020]   at building such things.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:59.020]   Now, there was a rather wealthy man in Danzig
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:05.420]   by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.860]   He was a brewer in town.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.560]   And he had become fascinated with the telescope.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.980]   This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.220]   after the telescope had moved out and become more common.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.860]   And he built a large observatory
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:25.620]   on the top of his brewery, actually.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.900]   And working with his wife,
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   they used these very elaborately constructed
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.940]   brass and metal instruments to make observations
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.660]   of positions of the stars.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:42.900]   And he published a whole new catalog of where the stars are.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.060]   And he claimed it was incredibly accurate.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.780]   He claimed it was so accurate
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.940]   that nothing had ever come close to it.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.100]   Hook reads this, and he says, "Wait a minute.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.940]   You didn't use a telescope here of any kind,
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.980]   because what's the point?
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.820]   Unless you do something to the telescope,
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.020]   all you see are dots with stars.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.380]   You just use your eye.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.940]   Your eyes can't be that good.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.800]   It's impossible."
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.300]   So what did Hook do to prove this?
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.920]   He said, "What you should have done
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.880]   is you should have put a little device in the telescope
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.780]   that lets you measure distances between these dots.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.180]   You didn't do that, and 'cause you didn't,
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.420]   there's no way you could have been that good."
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:25.420]   At two successive meetings of the Royal Society,
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.980]   he hauls the members out into the courtyard,
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.860]   and he takes a card,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.140]   and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.300]   And he pastes the card up on a wall,
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.620]   and he takes them one by one.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.600]   He says, "Now, move back," looking at it,
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.180]   presumably with one eye, "until you can't tell
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.860]   the black ones from the white stripes."
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.220]   He says, "That, I can then measure the distance.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.820]   I can see the angles.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.820]   I can give a number, then, for what is the best possible,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:04.180]   what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision."
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.500]   And it turned out, he thought,
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.240]   to be something like 10 or more times worse
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.260]   than this guy Hevelius had claimed.
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.140]   So obviously, he says, "Look, Hevelius," right.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:21.140]   Well, years ago, I calculated Hevelius's numbers,
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.700]   and so on, using modern tables from NASA, and so on,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   and they are even more accurate than Hevelius claimed.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.140]   And worse than that,
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:35.020]   the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.820]   over to Danzig to work with him, and Halley writes back,
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.720]   and he says, "I couldn't believe it,
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.980]   but I could, he taught me how to do it,
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.140]   and I could get just as good as he, how is it possible?"
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.700]   Well, here, this shows you something very interesting
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.140]   about experiments, perception, and everything else.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.640]   Hooke was right, but he was also wrong.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.660]   He was wrong for the right reasons,
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   and he was right for the wrong reasons.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.020]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.860]   What he actually found was the number
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.340]   for what we now call 20/20 vision.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.700]   He was right.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.700]   You can't tell, except a few people, much better than that.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.180]   But he was observing the wrong thing.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:24.280]   What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot,
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.860]   a star, moving past a pointer.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:34.180]   Our eyes are rather similar to frogs' eyes.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.060]   You know, I'm sure you've heard the story,
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:40.640]   if I hold a dead fly on a string in front of a frog
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.100]   and don't move it, the frog pays no attention.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.780]   As soon as I move the fly,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.300]   the frog immediately tongue lats out,
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.780]   because the visual system of the frog responds to motion.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.660]   So does ours, and our acuity for distinguishing motion
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.020]   from statics, five or more times better.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.740]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   Damn, and of course, I mean, maybe you can comment
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.040]   on their understanding of the human perceptual system
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.440]   at the time was probably really terrible.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.680]   Like, yeah, like I've recently been working
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.240]   with just almost as a fun side thing with vision scientists
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.680]   and peripheral vision, it's a beautiful,
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.760]   complex mess, that whole thing.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.020]   We still don't understand all the weird ways
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.720]   that human perception works,
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.240]   and they were probably terrible at it.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.160]   They probably didn't have any conception
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.000]   of peripheral vision or the fovea,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.760]   or I mean, basically anything.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.520]   - They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.280]   himself who probed a lot of this.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.400]   For instance, Newton, the young Newton,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.960]   trying to work his way around what's going on with colors,
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.080]   wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.800]   through natural processes out there,
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.540]   and colors that are a result of our eyes
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.560]   not operating right.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.920]   So you know what he did?
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.040]   It's a famous thing.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.840]   He took a stick, and he stuck that stick
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.680]   under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.680]   And what that did would produce colored circles
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.520]   at diametrically opposite positions
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.840]   of the stick in the eyeball,
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.380]   and he moved it around to see how they moved,
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.840]   trying to distinguish.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.240]   - Legit.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.200]   - Right?
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.880]   I always have to tell my students don't do this, but.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.080]   - Or do it if you wanna be great
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.720]   and remembered by human history.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.840]   There's a lot of equivalent to sticking a stick
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.360]   into your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.200]   Okay.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:55.240]   As a small aside, is the Newton and the apple story true?
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.060]   - No.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.400]   - Was it a different fruit?
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.520]   - As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.320]   in England once said on a NOVA program
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.240]   that we were both on,
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.280]   the role of fruit in the history of science
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.040]   has been vastly exaggerated.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.920]   - Okay.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   So was there any, I mean, to zoom out, moments of epiphany.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.640]   Is there something to moments of epiphany?
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.160]   Or again, this is the paradigm shift versus the gradualism.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.000]   - There is a shift.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.580]   It's a much more complex one than that.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:37.580]   And we, as it happens, a colleague of mine
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.880]   and I are writing a paper right now
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.840]   on one of the aspects of these things
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.080]   based on the work that many of our colleagues have done
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.540]   over the last 30 and 40 years.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:52.600]   Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.480]   Newton, until the early 1670s,
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.880]   and probably really until a fair time after that,
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.840]   first of all, was not very interested
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.840]   in questions of motion.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.700]   He was working actually in all chemical relationships
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.480]   or what is called by historians, chymistry,
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.300]   a kind of early modern chemical structure.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.600]   Colleagues of ours at Indiana
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.160]   have even reproduced the amalgams that, anyway.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   His way of thinking about motion
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.040]   involved a certain set of relationships
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   which was not conducive to any application
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:45.180]   that would yield computationally direct results
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.440]   for things like planetary motions,
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.940]   which he wasn't terribly interested in anyway.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:54.900]   He enters a correspondence
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.620]   with his original nemesis, Robert Hooke.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.740]   And Hooke says, "Well, have you ever thought about,"
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.120]   and then Hooke tells him,
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.060]   "A certain way you might think about it."
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.860]   And when Newton hears that,
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.740]   he recognizes that there is a way to inject time
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   that would enable him to solve certain problems.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.740]   It's not that there was anything he thought before
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.680]   that was contrary to that way of thinking.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   It's just that that particular technical insight
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:30.140]   was not something that, for a lot of reasons
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:34.340]   that are complex, had never occurred to him at all.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.360]   And that sent him a different way of thinking.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.820]   But to answer your question about the Apple business,
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.320]   which is always about gravity and the moon
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.120]   and all of that being, no.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:48.700]   The reason there is that the idea
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:53.700]   that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:58.000]   and what goes on at the moon, let us say,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.320]   remind the sun and the planet,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.440]   can be due to a direct relationship
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.140]   between the earth, let's say, and the moon,
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:12.120]   is contrary to fundamental beliefs
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.340]   held by many of the mechanical philosophers,
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.720]   as they're called at the time,
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.800]   in which everything has to involve
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.200]   at least a sequence of direct contacts.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.480]   Has to be something between here and there that's involved.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   And Hooke, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it,
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.640]   based on what he said, along with others,
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.760]   like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren,
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.080]   hearkened back to the notion that, well,
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.660]   maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.820]   between the moon and maybe the planets
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.020]   and the earth and gravity and so on.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.760]   Vague, but establishing a direct connection somehow,
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.860]   however it's happening, forget about it.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.700]   Newton wouldn't have cared about that
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.280]   if that's all they said, but it was when Hooke
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.000]   mentioned this different way of thinking about the motion,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.720]   a way he could certainly have thought of
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.680]   'cause it does not contradict anything.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.840]   Newton is a brilliant mathematician,
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.040]   and he could see that you could suddenly start
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.520]   to do things with that that you otherwise wouldn't.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.480]   This led eventually to another controversy with Hooke,
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.920]   in which Hooke said, well, after Newton published
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.160]   his great Principia, I gave him how to do this.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.320]   And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.160]   and said, well, listen to this.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.760]   I did everything, and 'cause he had a picayune little idea,
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.640]   he thinks he can take credit for it.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.480]   - Okay.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.120]   So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.720]   is what solidified the initial intuition
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.800]   that you could have.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.600]   Was that the first time he was born the idea
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.760]   that you have action at a distance,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.240]   that you can have forces without contact,
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.040]   which is another revolutionary idea?
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:01.840]   - I would say that in the sense of dealing
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   with the mechanics of force-like effects
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.360]   considered to act at some distance,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   it is novel with both Hooke and Newton at the time.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.700]   The notion that two things might interact at a distance
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.400]   with one another without direct contact,
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.600]   that goes back to antiquity.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.800]   Only there it was thought of more as a sympathetic reaction
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.120]   to a magnet and a piece of iron.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.840]   They have a kind of mutual sympathy for one another.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.360]   - Like what, love?
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.200]   What are we talking about?
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.920]   - Well, actually, they do sometimes talk like that.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.840]   - That it's love.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.080]   See, now I talk like that all the time.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.560]   I think love is somehow in consciousness
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.600]   are forces of physics that are yet to be discovered.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   Okay, now there's the other side of things,
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.640]   which is calculus, that you began to talk about.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.480]   So Newton brought a lot of things to this world.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.920]   One of them is calculus.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.160]   What is calculus?
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.040]   And what was Newton's role in bringing it to life?
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.920]   What was it like?
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.080]   What was the story of bringing calculus to this world?
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.960]   - Well, since the publication starting many decades ago
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.680]   by Tom Whiteside, who's now deceased,
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.840]   of Newton's mathematical papers,
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.140]   we know a lot about how he was pushing things
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.760]   and how he was developing things.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.440]   It's a complex question.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.960]   To say what calculus is,
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.760]   calculus is the set of mathematical techniques
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.080]   that enable you to investigate
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.940]   what we now call functions, mathematical functions,
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.840]   which are continuous, that is,
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.720]   that are not formed out of discrete sets,
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.860]   like the counting numbers, for instance.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.760]   Newton, there were already
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.760]   procedures for solving problems involving such things
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:17.320]   as finding areas under curves and tangents to curves
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.920]   by using geometrical structures,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.800]   Newton, as a young man, we know this is what happened,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.800]   is looking at a formula which involves an expansion
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.720]   in separate terms, polynomial terms, as we say,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.280]   for certain functions.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.080]   I know I wanna get complicated here about this,
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.680]   and he realizes it could be generalized,
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.880]   and he tries the generalization,
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.760]   and that leads him to an expansion formula
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.200]   called the binomial theorem.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.920]   That enables him to move ahead with the notion
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.640]   that if I take something that has a certain value,
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.540]   and I add a little bit to it,
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.040]   and I use this binomial theorem and expand things out,
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.520]   I can begin to do new things,
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.860]   and the new things that he begins to do
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.840]   leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.360]   and the calculations of tangents to curves
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.400]   are reciprocal to one another,
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.080]   and the procedures that he develops
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.880]   is a particular form of the calculus
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:43.320]   in which he considers small increments
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   and then continuous flows and changes of curves and so on,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.800]   and we have relics of it in physics today,
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.580]   the notation in which you put a dot over a variable
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.200]   indicating the rate of change of the variable.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.080]   That's Newton's original type of notation.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:07.460]   The dot, yeah, the dot notation.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:14.000]   Possibly independently of Newton,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.720]   because he didn't publish this thing,
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.360]   although he became quite well-known
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.320]   as quite a brilliant young man,
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   in part because people heard about his work and so on.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   When another young man by the name of Gottfried Leibniz
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   visited London, and he heard about these things,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.360]   it is said that he independently develops
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.920]   his form of the calculus,
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.320]   which is actually the form we use today,
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.040]   both in notation and perhaps
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.080]   in certain fundamental ways of thinking.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.360]   It has remained a controversial point
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.360]   as to where exactly and how much independently
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.640]   Leibniz did it.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.440]   Leibniz aficionados think and continue to maintain
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440]   he did it completely independently.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.480]   Newton, when he became president of the Royal Society,
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.320]   put together a group to go on the attack,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.960]   saying, "No, he must have taken everything."
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.860]   We don't know, but I will tell you this.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.480]   About 25 or so years ago,
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.040]   a scholar who's a professor at Indiana now
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.240]   named Domenico Melli got his hands
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.600]   on a Leibniz manuscript called the 10 Taman,
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   which was Leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.960]   to Newton's mechanics.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.760]   And it comes to some conclusions
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.280]   that you have in Newton's mechanics.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.480]   Well, he published that, but Melli got the manuscript.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.320]   And what Melli found out was that Leibniz
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.200]   reverse engineered the Principia and cooked it backwards
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.680]   so that he could get the results he wanted.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.520]   Now--
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.340]   - That was for the mechanics,
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.720]   so that means his mind allows for that kind of thing.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.160]   - Some people--
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.720]   - You're breaking some news today.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.400]   You're starting some old drama.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.040]   - Some people think so.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.000]   I think most historians of mathematics
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.920]   do not agree with that.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.620]   A friend of mine, rather well-known physicist,
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.200]   unfortunately died a couple years ago,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.680]   named Mike Nauenberg at UC Santa Cruz,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.440]   had some evidence along those lines.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.680]   Didn't pass mustard with many of my friends
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.480]   who are historians of math.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.760]   In fact, I edit with a historian of math
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.900]   a technical journal, and we were unable
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.080]   to publish it in there because we couldn't get it through
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.160]   any of our colleagues.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   But I remain suspicious.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.080]   - What is it about those tense relationships
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.320]   and that kind of drama?
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.440]   Einstein doesn't appear to have much of that drama.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.520]   Nobody claimed, I haven't heard claims that they've,
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.480]   perhaps 'cause it's such crazy ideas,
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:01.400]   of any of his major inventions, major ideas,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.080]   being those that are, basically,
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.720]   I came up with it first or independently.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.000]   There's not, as far as I'm aware,
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.500]   not many people talk about general relativity,
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.520]   especially in those terms, but with Newton,
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.120]   that was the case.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.000]   I mean, is that just a natural outgrowth
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.080]   of how science works?
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.240]   Is there going to be personalities that,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.900]   I'm not saying this about Leibniz, but maybe I am,
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.960]   that there's people who steal ideas for the,
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.240]   because of ego, because of all those kinds of things.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.660]   - I don't think it's all that common, frankly.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:43.240]   The Newton book, Leibniz, Contre-Temps, and so on,
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.880]   well, you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there,
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.720]   and so on.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.520]   These are difficult and complex times as well.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.520]   These are times in which science as an activity
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.120]   pursued by other than, let us say,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.400]   interested aristocrats,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.840]   is becoming something somewhat different.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.720]   It's not a professional community of investigators
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.440]   in the same way.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.440]   It's also a period in which procedures and rules,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.980]   practice are being developed to avoid attacking
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.520]   one another directly and pulling out a sword
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.560]   to cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.000]   and so on.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.840]   So it's a very different period.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.520]   Controversies happen, people get angry.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.680]   I can think of a number of others,
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.780]   including in the development of optics
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.560]   in the 19th century and so on.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.760]   And it can get hot under the collar.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.840]   Sometimes one character who's worked an area extensively,
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.560]   whether they've come up with something
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.080]   terribly novel or not,
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.840]   and somebody else kind of moves in
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.320]   and does completely different novel things,
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.640]   the first guy gets upset about it
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.880]   because he's sort of muscled in
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.160]   to what I thought was my area.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.640]   You find that sort of stuff.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.860]   - But do you have examples of cases
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.300]   where it worked out well?
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.100]   Like that competition is good for the progress of science?
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.460]   - Yeah, it almost always is good in that sense.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.300]   - Just painful for the individuals involved.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.140]   - Can be, yeah.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:25.300]   It doesn't have to be nasty, although sometimes it is.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.700]   - So on the space, like for the example of the optics,
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.020]   could you comment on that one?
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.260]   - Well, yeah, sure.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.940]   Let me, there's several, but I could give you...
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:37.500]   All right, so I'll give you this example
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.700]   that probably is the most pertinent.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:48.460]   The first polytechnic school, like MIT or Caltech,
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.820]   was actually founded in France
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.080]   during the French Revolution.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.220]   It exists today.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.200]   It's the École Polytechnique, right?
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.620]   Two people who were there were two young men
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.280]   in the '90s, 1790s, named on the one hand,
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.820]   François Arago and the other, Jean-Baptiste Biot.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:13.700]   They both lived a long time, well into the 1850s.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.300]   Arago became a major administrator of science
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.020]   and Biot's career started to peter out
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.580]   after about the late teens.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:28.580]   Now, they are sent on an expedition,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.420]   which was one of the expeditions
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.420]   involving measuring things to start the metric system.
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.720]   There's a lot more to that story.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.060]   Anyway, they come back, Arago gets separated.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:45.060]   He's captured by pirates, actually.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.900]   Wounds up in Tangier, escapes, is captured again.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.220]   Everybody thinks he's dead.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.580]   He gets back to Paris and so on.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.860]   He's greeted as a hero and whatnot.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.640]   In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.880]   some of the stuff that he's done
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.860]   and Arago doesn't get much credit for it
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:06.780]   and Arago starts to get very angry.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.300]   Biot is known for this kind of thing.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.300]   So Arago, anyway, Biot starts investigating
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.480]   a new phenomenon in optics
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.460]   involving something called polarization.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.700]   And he writes all kinds of stuff on it.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.620]   Arago looks into this and decides
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.980]   to write some things as well.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:33.420]   And actually, Biot gets mostly interested in it
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.660]   when he finds out that Arago is doing stuff.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:40.400]   Now, Biot is actually the better scientist in a lot of ways.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.500]   But Arago is furious about this.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   So furious that he actually demands and forces
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.220]   the leader of French science, Laplace,
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.220]   the Marquis de Laplace, and cohorts to write a note
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:14:01.040]   in the published journal saying, oh, excuse us.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.860]   Actually, Arago, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.860]   So Arago continues to just hold this antipathy
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.580]   and fear of Biot.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.140]   So what happens?
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:20.140]   1815, Napoleon is finished at Waterloo.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.160]   A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.100]   who's in the army is going back to his home
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.180]   on the north coast of France in Normandy.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.080]   He passes through Paris.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.360]   Arago is friends with Fresnel's uncle
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.500]   who's the head of the École des Beaux-Arts at the time.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.400]   Anyway, Fresnel is already interested
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.920]   in certain things in light.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.080]   He talks to Arago.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.760]   Arago tells him a few things.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.240]   Fresnel goes home.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.160]   Fresnel is a brilliant experimenter.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.160]   He observes things and he's a very good mathematician.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.240]   Calculates things.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.360]   He writes something up.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.840]   He sends it to Arago.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.240]   Arago looks at it and Arago says to himself,
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.720]   I can use this to get back at Biot.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.880]   He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in a room
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.120]   at the observatory where Arago is
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.440]   for Fresnel to continue his work.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.560]   Paper after paper comes out,
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.640]   undercutting everything Biot had done.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.200]   - What is it about jealousy and just envy
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.200]   that could be an engine of creativity and productivity
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.760]   versus like an Einstein where it seems like not?
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.280]   I don't know which one is better.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.880]   I guess it depends on the personality.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.100]   Both are useful engines in science.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.220]   - Well, in this particular story,
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.960]   it's maybe even more interesting
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.480]   because Fresnel himself, the young guy,
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.560]   he knew what Arago was doing with him
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.200]   and he didn't like it.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.240]   He didn't want to get with, he wrote his brother,
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.240]   said I don't want to get in an argument with Biot.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.400]   I just want to do my stuff.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.760]   Arago is using him but it's because Arago
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.720]   kept pushing him to go into certain areas
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.800]   that stuff kept coming out.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.680]   - Ego is beautiful.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.000]   Okay, but back to Newton.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.600]   There's a bunch of things I want to ask
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.280]   but sort of let's say since we're on the Leibniz
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.920]   and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.100]   Why was Newton a complicated man?
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:36.920]   We're breaking news today.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.760]   This is like--
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.200]   - I am right, why was he complicated?
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.000]   His brain structure was different.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.880]   I don't know why.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.500]   He had a complicated young life as we've said.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:53.680]   He had always been very self-contained and solitary.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.480]   He had acquaintances and friends
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.600]   and when he moved to London eventually,
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.320]   he had quite a career.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.720]   A career for instance that led him
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.560]   when he was famous by then, the 1690s.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:11.560]   He moves to London, he becomes first warden of the mint.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.760]   The mint is what produces coins
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.800]   and coinage was a complicated thing
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.240]   'cause there was counterfeiting going on
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.880]   and he becomes master of the mint to the extent
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.640]   and a guy at MIT wrote a book about this a little bit.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.320]   We wrote something on it too.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.760]   I forget his name was Levin.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.400]   That Newton sent investigators out to catch these guys
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.960]   and sent at least one of them,
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.580]   a famous one named Challoner to the gallows.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:45.000]   One of the reasons he probably was
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.460]   so particularly angry at Challoner
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.880]   was Challoner had apparently said some nasty things
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.240]   about Newton in front of parliament at some point.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.080]   - Fair enough.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.720]   - That was apparently not a good idea.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.800]   - Well, he had a bit of a temper
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.840]   so Newton had a bit of a temper.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.220]   - Clearly, clearly.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.220]   But he even as a young man at Cambridge,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.400]   though he doesn't come from wealth,
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   he attracts people who recognize his smarts.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.160]   There's a young fellow named Humphrey Newton,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.080]   shared his rooms.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.740]   These students always shared rooms with one another,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.200]   became his kind of amanuensis
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   to write down what Newton was doing and so on.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.760]   And there were others over time
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.120]   who he befriended in various ways and so on.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.800]   He was solitary.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.880]   He had, as far as we know,
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.900]   no relationships with either women or men
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.920]   in anything other than a formal way.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.760]   The only--
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.400]   - Those get in the way, relationships.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.240]   - Right.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.600]   Well, I mean, he was,
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.000]   I don't know if he was close to his mother.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.280]   I mean, she passed away, everything left him.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.080]   He went to be with her after she died.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.920]   He was close to his niece, Catherine Barton,
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.680]   who basically came to run his household
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.200]   when he moved to London and so on.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.480]   And she married a man named Conduit
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.400]   who became one of the people
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.680]   who controlled Newton's legacy later on and so on.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.440]   So he, and you can even see the house,
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.920]   the townhouse that Newton lived in in those days,
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.520]   still there.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.440]   - So there's the story of Newton coming up
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.520]   with quite a few ideas during a pandemic.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.760]   We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.600]   - Right.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.280]   - And a lot of people use that example
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.200]   as motivation for everybody while they're in lockdown
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.040]   to get stuff done.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.600]   So what's that about?
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.300]   Can you tell the story of that?
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.140]   - Well, I can.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.760]   Let me first say that, of course,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.880]   we've been teaching over Zoom lately.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.280]   - There was no Zoom back then?
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   - There was no Zoom back then.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.720]   Although it wouldn't have made much difference
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.800]   because the story was Newton was so complicated
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.880]   in his lectures that at one point,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.680]   Humphrey Newton actually said that he might as well
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.960]   have just been lecturing to the walls
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:14.560]   'cause nobody was there to listen to it.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.840]   So what difference?
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.680]   But--
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.960]   - Also not a great teacher, huh?
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.280]   - If you look at his optical notes,
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.120]   if that's what he's reading from--
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.180]   - Oh boy, okay.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.360]   - No.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.000]   (both laughing)
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.440]   - So what can you say about that whole journey
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.760]   through the pandemic that resulted in so much innovation
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.440]   in such a short amount of time?
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.280]   - Well, I mean, there's two times that he goes home.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.200]   Would he have been able to do it and do do it
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.440]   if he'd stayed at Cambridge?
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.000]   I think he would have.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.840]   I don't think it really,
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.040]   although I do like to tell my advanced students
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.600]   when I lecture on the history of physics
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.520]   to the physics and chemistry students,
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.160]   especially we've been doing it over Zoom in the last year,
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.720]   when we get to Newton and so on,
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.600]   'cause these kids are 21, 22,
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.160]   I like to say, well, you know,
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.880]   when Newton was your age and he had to go home
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.580]   during an epidemic, do you know what he produced?
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.940]   - So can you actually summarize this
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.900]   for people who don't know how old was Newton
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.260]   and what did he produce?
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:21.020]   - Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it said,
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.820]   when he's 18 years old in 1660.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.700]   And the so-called miraculous year,
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:32.180]   the annus mirabilis, where you get the development
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:36.380]   in the calculus and in optical discoveries especially,
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.180]   is 1666, right?
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.100]   So he's what, 24 years old at the time.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:47.340]   But judging from the notebooks that I mentioned,
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:51.100]   he's already before that come to an awful lot
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:55.520]   of developments over the previous couple of years.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.720]   Doesn't have much to do with the fact
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.840]   that he twice went home.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.140]   It is true that the optical experiments
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.640]   that we talked of a while ago
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.880]   with the light on the wall moving up and down
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.180]   were done at home.
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.360]   In fact, you can visit the very room he did it in
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.940]   to this day.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.260]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.020]   And if you look through the window in that room,
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.460]   there is an apple tree out there in the garden.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.660]   - So you might be wrong about this.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:24.940]   You're lying to me.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.660]   Maybe there's an apple involved after all.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.940]   - It's not the same apple tree, but it's cuttings.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.620]   - How do you know?
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.740]   - They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.580]   - Oh, not this.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.840]   (laughing)
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.000]   - Oh, wow, I continue with the dumbest questions.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.560]   Okay, so you're saying that perhaps going home was not--
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.320]   - It may have given him an opportunity
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.600]   to work things through.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.520]   And after all, he did make use of that room
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.720]   and he could do things like put a shade over the window,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.100]   move things around, cut holes in it and do stuff.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.680]   Probably in his rooms at Cambridge, he maybe not.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.140]   Although when he stayed at Cambridge,
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.380]   subsequently became a fellow.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.820]   And then the first, actually the second
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:13.060]   Lucasian professor there, he was actually really
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.500]   the first one because Isaac Barrow,
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.300]   who was the mathematician, professor of optics
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.260]   who recognized Newton's genius,
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.500]   gave up what would have been his position
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.020]   because he recognized,
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.520]   Newton may not have learned too much from him,
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.180]   although they did interact.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.820]   And so Newton was the first Lucasian professor really,
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.020]   the one that Stephen Hawking held 'til he died.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:43.860]   And we know that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge,
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.300]   subsequently, 'cause rooms are still there,
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.580]   he built an alchemical furnace outside,
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.540]   did all sorts of stuff in those rooms.
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:55.480]   And don't forget, you didn't have to do too much
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.420]   as a Lucasian professor.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.240]   Every so often, you had to go give these lectures,
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.980]   whether anybody was there or not,
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.720]   and deposit the notes for the future,
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.780]   which is how we have all those things.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:12.860]   - Oh, they were stored and now we have them,
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:16.100]   and now we know just how terrible of a teacher Newton was.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:18.020]   - Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.960]   In fact, the second volume of Newton's,
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.100]   of the notes really on the great book
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.740]   that he published, "The Optics,"
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.140]   which he published in 1704,
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.880]   that has just been finished
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.480]   with full annotations and analysis
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.800]   by the greatest analyst of Newton's optics, Alan Shapiro,
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:41.560]   who retired a few years ago at the University of Minnesota
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.820]   and been working on Newton's optics
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.360]   ever since I knew him and before,
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.800]   and I've known him since 1976.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.720]   - Is there something you could say broadly
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.200]   about either that work on optics
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.740]   or Principia itself as something
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:03.300]   that I've never actually looked at as a piece of work?
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:08.560]   Is it powerful in itself,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.060]   or is it just an important moment in history
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.880]   in terms of the amount of inventions that are within,
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.400]   the amount of ideas that are within,
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:20.720]   or is it a really powerful work in itself?
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.560]   - Well, it is a powerful work in itself.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   You can see this guy coming to grips with
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.720]   and pushing through and working his way around
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.320]   complicated and difficult issues,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.160]   melding experimental situations
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.820]   which nobody had worked with before,
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.560]   even discovering new things,
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.720]   trying to figure out ways of putting this together
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.400]   with mathematical structures,
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.360]   succeeding and failing at the same time,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.120]   and we can see him doing that.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   - I mean, what is contained within Principia?
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.680]   I don't even know, in terms of the scope of the work.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.520]   - All right.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.320]   - Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton?
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.160]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.800]   The Principia Mathematica--
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.560]   - Is he calculus?
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.840]   - Well, he, all right, so.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.880]   The Principia's divided into three books.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.720]   - Excellent.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:20.820]   - Book one contains his version of the laws of motion,
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.540]   and the application of those laws
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:28.120]   to figure out when a body moves in certain curves
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.480]   and is forced to move in those curves
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.600]   by forces directed to certain fixed points,
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.760]   what is the nature of the mathematical formula
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.160]   for those forces?
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.400]   That's all that book one is about,
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.740]   and it contains not the kind of version of the calculus
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.540]   that uses algebra of the sort
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.320]   that I was trying to explain before,
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.700]   but is done in terms of ratios
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.940]   between geometric line segments
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.800]   when one of the line segments goes very, very small.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.540]   It's called a kind of limiting procedure,
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.560]   which is calculus, but it's a geometrically structured,
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.120]   although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.120]   and that makes the Principia's mathematical structure
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.600]   rather hard for people who aren't studying it today
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.520]   to go back to.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.520]   Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.480]   and a little bit about hydrodynamics,
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.100]   a fuller development of the concept of pressure,
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:43.040]   which is a complicated concept,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.260]   and book three applies what he did in book one
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.720]   to the solar system,
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.520]   and it is successful partially
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:58.680]   because the only way that you can exactly solve,
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.720]   the only types of problems you can exactly solve
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.720]   in terms of the interactions of two particles
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.520]   governed by gravitational force between them
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.000]   is for only two bodies.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.640]   If there's more than two, let's say it's A, B, and C,
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.440]   A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A,
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.540]   you cannot solve it exactly.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.340]   You have to develop techniques.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.920]   The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.460]   about 30 or 40 years after Newton's death
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.460]   by French mathematicians like Laplace.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:39.060]   Newton tried to apply his structure
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:41.980]   to the sun, earth, moon,
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:45.220]   'cause the moon's motion is very complicated.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.260]   The moon, for instance,
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:52.220]   exactly repeats its observable position among the stars
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.920]   only every 19 years.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.740]   That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.580]   at certain times, and it changes, it's complicated.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.540]   That's, by the way, that was discovered,
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.780]   that was discovered by the Babylonians.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.220]   - That fact, the 19 years.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.700]   - Thousands of years ago, yes.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.780]   - And then you have that little piece of data,
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.220]   and how do you make sense of it?
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:17.220]   I mean, that is data, and you have to--
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.660]   - And it's complicated.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:22.380]   So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.300]   a technique that had been developed by a man named Horrocks
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.580]   using certain laws of Kepler's
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.180]   to try and get around this thing,
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:33.140]   and Newton then sort of, my understanding,
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.100]   I've never studied this,
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:37.820]   has sort of reversed it and fit it together
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.320]   with his force calculations by way of an approximation.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:47.220]   And was able to construct a model to make some predictions.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.700]   - It fit things backwards pretty well.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.940]   - Okay, where does data fit into this?
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:01.940]   We kind of earlier in the discussion mentioned data
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.660]   as part of the scientific method.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:09.180]   How important was data to Newton?
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.740]   So like you mentioned Prism and playing with it
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.900]   and looking at stuff
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.260]   and then coming up with calculations and so on.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.840]   Where does data fit into any of his ideas?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.320]   - All right, well, let me say two things first.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.380]   One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method anymore
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:30.380]   because there is no one easily describable such method.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.620]   I mean, humans have been playing around with the world
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:37.060]   and learning how to repetitively do things
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:41.180]   and make things happen ever since humans became humans.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.060]   - Do you have a preferred definition
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.140]   of the scientific method?
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.580]   What are the various--
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.900]   - No, I don't.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.580]   I prefer to talk about
[01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:57.820]   the considered manipulation of artificial structures
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:03.500]   to produce results that can be worked together
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.660]   with schemes to construct other devices
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:12.340]   and make predictions if you will
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.460]   about the way such things will work.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:17.260]   - So ultimately it's about producing other devices.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.100]   It's like leads you down--
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.780]   - I think so principally.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:24.220]   I mean, you may have data if you will,
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.060]   like astronomical data obtained otherwise and so on,
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:28.900]   but yes.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.700]   But number two here is this question of data.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:34.740]   What is data in that sense?
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.080]   See, when we talk about data today,
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.620]   we have a kind of complex notion
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:45.700]   which reverts to even issues of statistics
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.940]   and measurement procedures and so on.
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:51.540]   So let me put it to you this way.
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:55.140]   So let's say I had a ruler in front of me.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:55.980]   - Go on.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.460]   - And it's marked off in little black marks
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   separated by let's say distances called a millimeter.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.860]   Okay, now I make a mark on this piece of paper here.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.260]   So I made a nice black mark, right?
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.620]   Nice black mark.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.340]   And I ask you, I want you to measure that
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.700]   and tell me how long it is.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.020]   You're gonna take the ruler,
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.580]   you're gonna put it next to it,
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.360]   and you're gonna look,
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.580]   and it's not gonna sit,
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.020]   even if you put one end as close as you can
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.340]   on one black mark,
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:30.020]   the other end probably isn't gonna be
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.780]   exactly on a black mark.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.140]   Well, you'll say it's closer to this or that.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.660]   You'll write down a number.
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:37.740]   And I say, okay, take the ruler away a minute.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.420]   I take this away, come back in five minutes,
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.800]   put the piece of paper down, do it again.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.620]   You're gonna probably come up with a different number.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:48.060]   And you're gonna do that a lot of times.
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.060]   And then if I tell you,
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.500]   I want you to give me your best estimate
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.060]   of what the actual length of that thing is,
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.700]   what are you gonna do?
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:59.900]   You're going to average all of these numbers.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.740]   Why?
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:06.100]   - Statistics.
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.860]   - Well, yes, statistics.
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.000]   There's lots of ways of going around it,
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.020]   but the average is the best estimate
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.620]   on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem,
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:18.740]   a statistical theorem.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:20.640]   We were talking about things
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.180]   that were not really developed
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.100]   until the 1750s, '60s, and '70s.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.020]   Newton died in 1727.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.900]   - The intuition perhaps was there.
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:29.900]   - Not really.
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.580]   I'll tell you what people did, including Newton,
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.860]   although Newton is partially the one exception.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:39.220]   We talked a while ago about this guy, Christian Huygens.
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.060]   He measured lots of things.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:44.580]   And he was a good mechanic himself.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.780]   He and his brother ground lenses.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:47.700]   Huygens, I told you,
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.740]   developed the first pendulum mechanism,
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:53.780]   pendulum-driven clock with a mechanism and so on.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.180]   Also, a spring watch,
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.380]   where he got into a controversy
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.040]   with Hooke over that, by the way.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.980]   - What's with these mechanics and the controversy?
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.980]   - Well, they get an argument.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:08.500]   Well, we also have Huygens' notes.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:13.100]   They're preserved at Leiden University in Holland.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:13.940]   He's Dutch.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.900]   For his work in optics, which was extensive.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.020]   We don't have time to go into that, except the following.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.320]   Number of years ago, I went through those things,
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.500]   because in this optical theory that he had,
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.220]   there are four numbers that you've got to be able
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:34.600]   to get good numbers on to be able to predict other things.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.980]   So what would we do today?
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:39.220]   What, in fact, was done at the end of the 18th century
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.900]   when somebody went back to this?
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.380]   You do what you just, I told you to do with the ruler.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:45.940]   You make a lot of measurements and average results.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.420]   We have Huygens' notes.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.180]   He did make a lot of measurements.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.140]   One after the other after the other.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:58.720]   But when he came to use the numbers for calculations,
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.380]   and indeed when he published things at the end of his life,
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.880]   he gives you one number,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.080]   and it's not the average of any of them.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.940]   It's just one of them.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.320]   Which one was it?
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.320]   The one that he thought he got so good at working
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.160]   by practice that he put down the one
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.860]   he was most confident in.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:25.880]   That was the general procedure at the time.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.200]   You wouldn't publish a paper in which you wrote down
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.460]   six numbers and said, well, I measured this six times.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.700]   Let me put them together.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:36.540]   None of them is really, they would have said,
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.500]   the right number, but I'll put them together
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.980]   and give you a good number.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.380]   No, you would have been thought of that,
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.860]   you don't know what you're doing.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:49.760]   - Yeah, by the way, there's just an inkling
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.600]   of value to that approach.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.580]   Just an inkling.
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:57.240]   We sometimes use statistics as a thing that,
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.900]   like, oh, that solves all the problems.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.360]   We'll just do a lot of it and we'll take the average,
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.300]   or whatever it is, as many excellent books on mathematics
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:09.240]   have highlighted the flaws in our approach
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.760]   to certain sciences that rely heavily on statistics.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.400]   Okay, let me ask you again for a friend
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.660]   about this alchemy thing.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.760]   You know, it'd be nice to create gold,
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.580]   but it also seems to come into play quite a bit
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.760]   throughout the history of science,
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.940]   perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:34.100]   Can you say something to the history of alchemy?
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.560]   - A little bit. - And its impact?
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.460]   - Sure.
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:41.000]   It used to be thought, two things.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.120]   One, that alchemy, which dates certainly back
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.320]   to the Islamic period in Islam,
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.760]   you're talking, you know, 11th, 12th, 13th centuries
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.780]   among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters.
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.640]   But it used to be thought that alchemy,
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   which picked up strikingly in the 15th, 16th century,
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:09.640]   1500s and thereabouts, was a sort of mystical procedure
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.120]   involving all sorts of strange notions and so on.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.680]   And that's not entirely untrue,
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.760]   but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.760]   were engaged in what was known as chrysopoea,
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.080]   that is, looking for ways to transform
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.680]   invaluable materials into valuable ones.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.480]   But in the process of doing so or attempting to do so,
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.480]   they learned how to create complex amalgams
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.240]   of various kinds.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.920]   They used very elaborate apparatus, glass alembics,
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.820]   in which they would use heat
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:58.540]   to produce chemical decompositions.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:02.160]   They would write down and observe these compositions.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:05.560]   And many of the so-called really strange-looking
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.480]   alchemical formulas and statements
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.080]   where they'll say something like,
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.200]   I can't produce it, but it'll be,
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:16.200]   the soul of Mars will combine with this, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:22.240]   These, it has been shown, are almost all actual formulas
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.840]   for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.440]   and what to do.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.120]   And by the time of Newton,
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:35.260]   Newton was reading the works of a fellow
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:37.360]   by the name of Starkey, who was actually,
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.020]   came from Harvard shortly before,
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:46.660]   in which things had progressed, if you will,
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:49.440]   to the point where the procedure turns
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:52.240]   into what historians call chrysopoea,
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.120]   which basically runs into the notion of thinking
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.220]   that these things are made out of particles.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.580]   This is the mechanical philosophy.
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:05.760]   Can we engage in processes, chemical processes,
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.880]   to rearrange these things,
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.280]   which is not so stupid after all.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.920]   I mean, we do it, except we happen to do it in reactors,
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.640]   not in chemical processes,
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.320]   unless, of course, it had happened
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.560]   that cold fusion had worked, which it didn't.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.280]   Well, right.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.400]   So that's the way they're thinking about these things.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.280]   There's a kind of mix.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.240]   And Newton engages extensively
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.480]   in those sorts of manipulations.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.760]   In fact, more in that than almost anything else,
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.680]   except for his optical investigations.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.560]   If you look through the latter parts of the 1670s,
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.600]   the last five, six, seven years or so of that,
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.160]   there's more on that than there is on anything else.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.760]   He's not working on mechanics.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:56.040]   He's pretty much gone pretty far in optics.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.520]   He'll turn back to optics later on.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   - So optics and alchemy,
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.040]   so what you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things.
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.200]   - Well, actually, if you go online
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.760]   and look at what Bill Newman,
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.340]   the professor at Bloomington, Indiana, has produced,
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:17.120]   you'll find the very shiny thing called the star regulus,
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.420]   which Newton describes as having produced
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:21.160]   according to a particular way,
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.160]   which Newman figured out and was able to do it.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.120]   And it's very shiny.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.920]   - There you go, proves the theorem.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.160]   - Can I ask you about God, religion,
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.760]   and its role in Newton's life?
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.840]   Was there helpful, constructive,
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.040]   or destructive influences of religion
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.200]   in his work and in his life?
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.960]   - Well, there you begin to touch on a complex question.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.800]   The role that God played
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.400]   would be an interesting question to answer
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.140]   should one go and be able to speak
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.720]   with this invisible character who doesn't exist.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.640]   But putting that aside for the moment.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.240]   - Yeah, we don't like to talk about others
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.960]   while they're not here, so.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.480]   - Right.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.640]   Newton is a deeply religious man,
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.800]   not unusually so, of course, for the time.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:21.840]   Clearly, his upbringing,
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.000]   and perhaps his early experiences,
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.480]   have exacerbated that in a number of ways,
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.760]   that he takes a lot of things personally,
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.840]   and he finds perhaps solace in thinking
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.560]   about a sort of governing, abstract,
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.720]   rule-making, exacting deity.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.560]   I think there is little question
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.560]   that his conviction that you can figure things out
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.560]   has a fair bit to do with his profound belief
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:05.700]   that this rule-maker doesn't do things arbitrarily.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:10.680]   Newton does not think that miracles have happened
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.300]   since maybe the time of Christ, if then,
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.560]   and not in the same way.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.520]   He was, for instance, an anti-Trinitarian.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.240]   He did not hold that Christ had a divine being,
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.760]   but was rather endowed with certain powers
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.300]   by the rule-maker and whatnot.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:33.320]   And he did not think that some of the tales
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.800]   of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.760]   occurred in anything like that way.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.600]   Some may have, some may not have.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.280]   Like everybody else, of course,
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.080]   he did think that creation had happened
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.960]   about 6,000 years ago.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.000]   - Wait, really?
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:51.840]   - Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.120]   Well, biblical chronology can give you a little bit
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.800]   about that, it's a little controversial, but sure.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.920]   - Interesting, wow.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.920]   - The deity created the universe 6,000 years ago.
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:09.200]   - And that didn't interfere with his playing around
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.800]   with the sun and the moon and the--
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.320]   - Oh, no, because he's figuring out,
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.280]   he's watching the brilliant construction
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.400]   that this perfect entity--
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.760]   - Did 6,000 years ago.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.800]   - Yeah, has produced.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.640]   - Plus or minus a few years.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.120]   - Well, if you go with Bishop Boshler, it's 4004 BCE.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.160]   Wanna be precise about it.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.040]   - We always, and this is a serious program,
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.440]   we always wanna be precise.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.560]   (both laughing)
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.880]   Okay, let me ask another ridiculous question.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.520]   If Newton were to travel forward in time
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.920]   and visit with Einstein and have a discussion
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   about space-time and general relativity,
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.200]   that conception of time and that conception of gravity,
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.000]   what do you think that discussion will go like?
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   - Put that way, I think Newton would sit there in shock
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.560]   and say, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.800]   If, on the other hand, there's a time machine,
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.880]   you go back and bring a somewhat younger Newton,
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.300]   not a man my age, say, I mean, he lived a long time,
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:24.100]   into his mid-80s, but take him when he's in his 40s,
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.380]   let's say, bring him forward
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.180]   and don't immediately introduce him to Einstein.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.820]   Let's take him for a ride on a railroad.
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:34.340]   Let him experience the railroad.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.140]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:41.140]   - Take him around and show him a sparking machine.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.940]   He knows about sparks.
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:48.100]   Sending off sparks.
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:51.480]   Show him wires, have him touch the wires
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.180]   and get a little shock.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:58.180]   Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:00.460]   Then let him hear the clicks
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:03.120]   in a telephone receiver and so on.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.780]   Do that for a couple of months.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:07.620]   Let him get accustomed to things.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:11.140]   Then take him into, not Einstein yet,
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:14.340]   let's say we're taking him into the 1890s.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:16.020]   Einstein is a young man then.
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:19.100]   We take him into some of the laboratories.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:22.500]   We show him some of the equipment, the devices.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.420]   Not the most elaborate ones.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.460]   We show him certain things.
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.220]   We educate him bit by bit.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.940]   - Oh, the optics, maybe focus on that.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:31.740]   - Certainly on optics.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.660]   You begin to show him things.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:36.280]   He's a brilliant human being.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:41.000]   I think bit by bit, he would begin to see what's going on.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.820]   But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein,
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.980]   he'd sit there, his eyes would glaze over.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.780]   - I mean, I guess it's almost a question
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:55.940]   of how big of a leap,
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.740]   how many leaps have been taken in science
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.980]   that go from Newton to Einstein?
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.020]   We sometimes in a compressed version of history
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:06.460]   think that not much.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.960]   - Oh, that's totally wrong.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.260]   A lot.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.620]   Huge amounts.
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:13.860]   In multifarious ways,
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.780]   involving fundamental conceptions,
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.400]   mathematical structures,
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.240]   the evolution of novel experimentation and devices,
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.020]   the organization of science, everything.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.860]   - Everything.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.740]   I mean, to a point where I wonder
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.260]   even if Newton was,
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:32.620]   like you said 40, but even like 30.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:36.180]   So he's very, like if he would be able to catch up
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.420]   with the conception of everything.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.620]   I wonder as a scientist,
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.980]   how much you load in from age five
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.500]   about this world in order to be able to conceive
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:51.500]   of the world of ideas that push that science forward.
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.340]   I mean, you mentioned the railroad
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.840]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.720]   That might be fundamental to our ability to invent
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.300]   even when it doesn't directly obviously seem relevant.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:06.680]   - Well, yes.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:11.340]   I mean, the railroad, the steam engine,
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:13.620]   the Watt engine, et cetera.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.340]   I mean, that was really the Watt engine,
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.380]   was developed pretty,
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:19.580]   although Watt knew Joseph Black,
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:22.020]   a chemist, scientist, and so on,
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.220]   did stuff on heat,
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.140]   was developed pretty much independently
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.140]   of the developing thoughts about heat at the time.
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:35.040]   But what it's not independent of
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.240]   is the evolution of practice
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.440]   in the manufacture and construction of devices
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.640]   which can do things in extraordinarily novel ways,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.340]   and the premium being gradually placed
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.500]   on calculating how you can make them more efficient.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:58.440]   That is of a piece with a way of thinking about the world
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.400]   in which you're controlling things and working it.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.620]   It's something that humans have been doing
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.560]   for a long time,
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:10.560]   but in this more concerted and structured way,
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.160]   I think you really don't find it in the fullest sense
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.720]   until well into the 1500s
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.000]   and really not fully until the 17th century later on.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:29.480]   - So Newton had this year of miracles.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:33.240]   I wonder if I could ask you briefly about Einstein
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.580]   and his year of miracles.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:38.880]   I've been reading, re-reading, revisiting
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.660]   the brilliance of the papers
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.700]   that Einstein published in the year 1905,
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.380]   one of which won him the Nobel Prize,
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:47.860]   the photoelectric effect,
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:52.340]   but also Brownian motion, special theory of relativity,
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:56.620]   and of course the old E equals MC squared.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:02.060]   Is there, does that make sense to you
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:05.800]   that these two figures had such productive years
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:08.800]   that there's this moment of genius?
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.960]   Maybe if we zoom out,
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.360]   I mean, my work is very much in artificial intelligence,
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.000]   so wondering about the nature of intelligence.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000]   Like how did we, how did evolution on Earth produce genius
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.560]   that could come up with so much in so little time?
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.060]   To me, that gives me hope
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.640]   that one person can change the world
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.200]   in such a small amount of time.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.200]   - Well, of course, there are precedents for,
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.520]   in both Newton's and Einstein's cases,
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.920]   for elements of what we're finding there,
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:48.480]   it's, you know, and so on.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.740]   Well, I have no idea.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.280]   You know, I'm sure you must have read,
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.820]   it was kind of a famous story,
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.880]   that after Einstein died, he donated his brain
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.920]   and they sliced it up
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.380]   to see if they could find something unusual there.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:04.180]   Nothing unusual visibly in there.
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:09.180]   So I have, clearly, there are people
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:11.420]   who for various reasons,
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.760]   maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:17.660]   in the sense of experience and so on,
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:22.660]   are capable of coming up with these extraordinary results.
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:25.660]   Many years ago, when I was a student,
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:28.000]   a friend of mine came in and said,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.640]   did you read about, did you read this?
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.040]   I forget what, anyway, there was a story in the paper.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.940]   It was about, I think it was a young woman,
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:41.860]   who was, she couldn't speak,
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:45.140]   and she was somewhere on the autism spectrum.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:50.140]   She could not read other people's affect in any way,
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.880]   but she could sit down at a piano,
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:59.920]   and having heard it once,
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.960]   and then run variations on the most complex
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.840]   pianistic works of Chopin and others.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.760]   Right, now how?
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:18.000]   - Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.620]   in some aspect of reality and become a master of it,
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:24.360]   and every once in a while, that means coming up
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.240]   with breakthrough ideas in physics.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.240]   Yeah, how the heck does that happen?
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.440]   - Who knows?
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:33.200]   - Jed, I'd like to say thank you so much
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.000]   for spending your valuable time with me today.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.160]   That was a really fascinating conversation.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:39.000]   I've learned so much about Isaac Newton,
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.560]   who's one of the most fascinating figures in human history,
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.000]   so thank you so much for talking to me.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.760]   - A pleasure, enjoyed it very much.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:48.000]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.080]   with Jed Buchwald.

[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.900]   a philosopher of science.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:04.120]   The answers you get depend on the questions you ask.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.080]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.660]   (upbeat music)
