[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   John Piper preached a sermon in December of 1996 titled,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.560]   "Jesus, from Melchizedek to Eternal Savior." In that sermon, John Piper explained the
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.920]   glorious ramifications of Hebrews chapter 7 verse 25, which reads this,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.920]   "Consequently, he, Jesus, is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.720]   God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them."
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   Here's what John Piper said.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:47.360]   Salvation is not static. As though I did something once to get saved, I believed.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.800]   And God did something once to save me. He sent Jesus to die and rise from the dead.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.000]   And that's all there is to it. Now, this verse is one screaming announcement.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.200]   That is not all there is to it. And what I want to try to do in these last moments is take a
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.640]   Sunday school understanding that's true, that simple past, "I believed, he died, I'm saved,"
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.720]   period, and grow it into biblical proportions with a verse like Hebrews 7, 25.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   Because Hebrews 7, 25 says, "There is not only more that Jesus did,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.960]   there is more that you do as well."
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.560]   What Jesus does is go on praying for you, interceding for you,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.440]   coming between you and the Father and making a case for you and standing up for you.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.400]   I'm going to stick in a parenthesis here to try to avoid a misunderstanding.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.320]   Parenthesis. "Do not conclude from my first implication
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.440]   that Jesus loves me and God hates me."
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.960]   Okay, let's get this straight now. The reason that would be a false conclusion
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.720]   is because the priesthood is God's idea, not Jesus' idea.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.680]   And Jesus accepted the Father's mandate to come save me from his wrath.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.280]   You got that? The love of God for me, sinner,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.080]   interposes his priestly son to save me from his wrath against me.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.960]   You got to handle that or you can't make sense out of the Bible.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:00.400]   The love of God for this worthless sinner interposes his most precious possession,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.080]   his son whom he loves, in order that he might save me from his wrath against me.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.040]   All the while vindicating his justice and upholding his glory in the cross.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   That's the beauty of the cross. It is the love of God rescuing sinners from the wrath of God
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   by vindicating the justice of God and upholding the glory of God.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.080]   You got to get that. Otherwise you will sentimentalize God.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.320]   And people are sentimentalizing God everywhere because they say,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   "Oh, in order to have a God of love, you got to get rid of wrath."
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   You don't. You don't have a God of love in biblical proportions
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.440]   if there's no wrath from which to save and no son to offer up to his wrath to show his love.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   Close parenthesis.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.480]   The second implication that we're working on now is that salvation is not static.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.640]   Don't just say, "I believed and I was saved."
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:24.240]   Say, "Also," that's true, "also Jesus is saving me. He's going to save me forever."
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.720]   First half of verse 25. I'm not making this up. It's there. Read it.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.040]   "Jesus goes on saving me by going on praying for me."
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.800]   And what I do is don't just look back and say, "I believed. I believed.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.160]   I remember. I walked the aisle or I signed the card or I knelt with my mother
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.120]   in Fort Lauderdale, Florida when I was six years old," which I did.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   You don't just say that. You say, "I today and for all of my life
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   will draw near to God through Jesus," because that's the person and the only person
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.040]   for whom Jesus prays and whom he saves.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:17.920]   If we are born of God, we will draw near to God through Jesus.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   This tense of this verb, "draw near to God," there is a tense in Greek for a single act,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   not repeated, and there is a tense for ongoing, repeated, continuous action.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:42.080]   And that's what's here. Those who keep on drawing near to God are the ones that
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.640]   enjoy the priestly work of Jesus. You're going through Jesus, and as long as you're going
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.360]   through Jesus, he's praying for you. He's moving on the Father. He's your advocate.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.160]   I write these things to you, little children, that you might not sin, but if you sin,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.840]   you have a what with the Father? An advocate, an intercessor, a lawyer in the court
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.720]   who wins every case against you.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.000]   10
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.320]   00;00;00;00 - 00;00;00;00
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.120]   Amen. And how easily we forget this glorious soul-sustaining truth.
