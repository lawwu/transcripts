[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   up in order to buy out a bigger company and then firing everyone and shutting down the
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.680]   pension plan and distributing the surplus to shareholders, it is just very standard
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680]   token behavior.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.920]   Whereas, if you look at the mortgage-backed securities boom and structured products generally
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.760]   in the mid-2000s, the way that people made money in that was just by being very, very
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.840]   detail-oriented and being able to make these incredibly fine-grained distinctions between
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.920]   different products that were basically similar, but one of them pays 5.7% and one of them
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.920]   pays 5.75%.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.280]   And if you lever up that difference enough times, you're actually making really good
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   money consistently.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.480]   It's super boring, but maybe with enough Adderall, it's actually very tolerable work that you
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.560]   can enjoy.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   So I do think that just within stimulants, the difference between short-acting stimulants
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.840]   and long-acting stimulants does mean the difference between a hostile takeover boom and a structured
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.560]   products boom.
