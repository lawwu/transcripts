[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:14.500]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the first chapter, and I shall read verses 15, 16, and
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500]   17.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.780]   "Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:31.860]   the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:40.180]   the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.160]   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him."
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.840]   Now I want particularly to deal with this petition, which is here recorded in the 17th
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.760]   verse, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:12.560]   you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.480]   Now this, obviously, is a part of this prayer which the apostle here tells these Ephesians
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.160]   and others to whom he was writing this letter, that he was constantly praying for them.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.640]   He ceases not, he says.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.180]   Now we have already considered a part of this prayer.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.000]   We have seen that the apostle starts with praise and with thanksgiving.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.360]   He thanks God that these Ephesians are what they are, that they have faith in the Lord
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.960]   Jesus and that they have love unto all the saints.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   He starts with thanksgiving.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.240]   And then we saw last Sunday morning that he is very careful to remind himself of the one
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.400]   to whom he is praying.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.280]   The apostle did not rush into prayer; he paused, he indulged in a period of recollection in
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.960]   which he reminded himself that he was not speaking to a mere human person, but that
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   he was addressing the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, yea, the Father of glory.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.480]   And we tried to see last Sunday morning that that alone is true prayer, when one realizes
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.680]   that one is indeed in such a presence and speaking to such a person.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.440]   Well now the apostle reminds himself of that because he has a petition, a great petition
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   to offer for these Ephesians.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.520]   And here we are going to start this morning a consideration of this great petition.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.920]   The petition goes on rarely until the end of the chapter, but I would indicate at this
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.280]   point that it can be divided into two main sections.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.460]   There is first of all a general petition.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.360]   Then he comes to the particulars, or if you like, he starts with a great and a comprehensive
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:30.120]   and all-inclusive petition, and then he deals with it bit by bit in its component parts.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.160]   Now we this morning can only look at the first, the general petition, the thing with which
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.800]   the apostle starts, the thing obviously to him which was of the greatest importance of
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.360]   all.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.840]   Now his petition for these Ephesians is, I think you'll agree with me, a most remarkable
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.160]   one, and especially in view of the fact of what he's already told us about them.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.400]   Because you remember that he has already said that he knows that these people have believed
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.040]   in the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.080]   the gospel of your salvation.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   They've got faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, they've believed in him, they've trusted
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   themselves to him, they've committed themselves to him.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:30.960]   But not only that, they have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   Those of us who attend here regularly will recall what that means.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.600]   It's that extraordinary action of God through the Holy Spirit in which he gives us a direct
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.840]   and an immediate assurance that we are the children of God, sealed with the Spirit.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.960]   He knows that this is true, and furthermore he knows that they have, through the Holy
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   Spirit likewise, an earnest of the inheritance to which they're going.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.760]   Something which gives them this absolute certainty, this kind of foretest, this partaking of the
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.880]   firstfruits of the great harvest to which they're going, they're already experiencing
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   that.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.760]   They've got the earnest of the inheritance, or as the apostle puts it in writing to the
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.240]   Romans, we are ourselves which have the firstfruits of the Spirit.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.120]   Now he knows that all that is true of these Ephesians, and yet you remember that in spite
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.520]   of that we find here that he still is not satisfied.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.840]   You would have thought that that perhaps was enough, and that there was no need to pray
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.400]   for people who've experienced all this, but the apostle does, and he's very urgent in
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.760]   his prayer, and he says that he goes on praying.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.000]   He doesn't cease to pray for them, he offers these petitions for them, and what he does
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   of course for these Ephesians, he does for all others, all the others to whom he writes
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   his letters.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   He prays for all who have become Christian, all whom he himself perhaps had established
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.400]   as churches, he's got this great pastoral heart and pastoral care for them, and he writes
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.200]   and he tells them all that he's praying for them and offering up a tremendous petition
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   for them.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   Well, very well, we are tempted to ask, is anything further possible?
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.840]   These people who've believed and have trusted, they're living a life of faith, they've
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.360]   got the seal of the Spirit, they've got the earnest of the Spirit, is anything more
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.920]   possible for a Christian?
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.040]   Do you still offer petitions for people like this?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.000]   And the simple answer is yes, there is infinitely more possible.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.960]   Conversion is not the end, it's merely the beginning.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's the mere first step.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.300]   It's like birth.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.000]   When a child is born, that's not the end, that's the beginning.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.400]   And conversion of becoming Christian is just that.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.000]   And it's because he knows that and that he's aware of the tremendous possibilities
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   that lie ahead of these people that the Apostle is praying for them.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.320]   There are possibilities ahead for them in every conceivable respect, and as a man who'd
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.640]   grown so much in grace, as one who had scaled the heights of the spiritual life, the Apostle
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.120]   is anxious that they should come along and that they should see the views that he's
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.080]   seeing from the mountaintops, and the panorama that stretches out ahead of him, and the heights
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:45.320]   that yet appear, he says of himself, not that I have yet apprehended, my position, he says,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.160]   is this, and he was writing towards the end of his life, forgetting those things which
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.700]   are behind, I press forward.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.200]   God forbid that anybody should stay there at the beginning with the mere first principles
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.400]   of the Gospel of Christ.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.840]   I'm praying for you, he says.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:07.760]   I want you to come on and begin to share in this tremendous Christian life into which
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.360]   you have come.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.920]   Now that's the meaning of his prayer, and therefore we must always pay very close and
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.600]   careful attention to all these apostolic prayers, because it is generally in them we are given
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.920]   these clear visions of the Christian life in its height and its depth, its length and
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.380]   its breadth.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.800]   We see something of the glory of the life into which we have been brought by God's
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.480]   amazing grace and love.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.160]   Very well then, what does he pray for?
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   What is the apostle's petition for these Ephesians?
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.280]   Here they are, they've believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, they're trusting him, they've
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.960]   given up trusting themselves, they're not relying upon their own goodness, their own
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.920]   religion or anything, entirely their trust and confidence is in him.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.400]   What does he pray for?
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   Now I wonder whether I'm wrong when I suggest that the apostle's actual petition may very
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   well come as somewhat of a surprise to a large number of people, owing to the present tendency
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.200]   in teaching concerning these matters.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.920]   Am I wrong when I suggest that the prevailing teaching is that the Christian life can be
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.640]   divided up into two sections.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.280]   First of all, we say people need to be saved.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.200]   They need to be delivered from the guilt of their sin and from the punishment of sin.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's one step.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And there you start, that's evangelism, they must be brought to that.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   Then they tend to go on and to say, having done that, there's one other step though,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.000]   they haven't finished there, that isn't the end, they'd agree that that's only
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   the beginning.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.280]   Then they say, there's a second step, what's that?
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.400]   Well, the only other thing that remains for such a person, they say, is that he now be
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:12.840]   delivered from the power of sin, from the tyranny of sin, from the thralldom of sin,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.600]   or to use other terminology, let's say first of all there is justification.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.000]   Then the only thing that remains is sanctification.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.760]   So that we take the convert now and we introduce him to the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.840]   He is clear about his forgiveness, he's clear now that the guilt is no longer there.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.640]   He sees it covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.120]   Ah yes, but he's still facing temptation, he's got the struggle, he's got sin within
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.040]   him, and he needs to be delivered from that.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.600]   That's the thing therefore to pray for, that these people now may be delivered from
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.200]   the power and the thralldom of sin, that they may be sanctified.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.800]   Well, of course, that's perfectly true.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.000]   But the thing that I want to emphasize this morning is that that is not what the Apostle
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.760]   prays for for the Ephesians.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.520]   And that is where I say the significance of this statement comes in.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   Of course, sanctification is a process which is essential for all of us.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.400]   We've often agreed that you mustn't put them into watertight compartments, that of
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.720]   course the moment a man is justified, sanctification has already started.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.480]   But that is not the serious thing as I see it.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.660]   The important thing is to notice what exactly the Apostle does pray for.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.960]   And the answer is, of course, that he doesn't pray for that.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.120]   He simply prays that God may give them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.760]   of him.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.560]   And I think there's a very good reason for this.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.880]   Surely, nearly all our troubles in connection with the Christian life arise from the fact
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.040]   that our ideas are so man-centered.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:09.640]   We always start with man these days instead of starting with God.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.640]   We start with man.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   What does man need?
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.800]   Man needs forgiveness.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.760]   Man needs deliverance from sin so that he shan't be unhappy in his life of failure.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.040]   It's always man.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   What does man need?
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.360]   What can be done for man?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.240]   But you notice that isn't the Apostle's approach at all.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.840]   Our view of salvation must never be man-centered, it must always be God-centered.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   You see, it is always with the Apostle.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.720]   He starts off in verse 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.620]   It all comes from God, and all our thinking must be in terms of God.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.000]   So that here you notice, when the Apostle comes to his petition, he's finished with
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.220]   his praise, his thanksgiving.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.040]   He now comes to his petition, and what he prays for the Ephesians, I put it quite bluntly
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.960]   as this, is not for their sanctification, nor for their happiness, nor for their joy,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:11.120]   nor for their liberation, but for this, that they may have the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.240]   in the knowledge of him.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.400]   That's his starting point.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.760]   That's the thing of which he puts first.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.560]   And again, it's very important that we should observe that this is no exceptional action
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.600]   on the part of the Apostle.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.520]   If you read the epistle to the Philippians, you'll find he does exactly the same thing.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.520]   He prays for them that their love may grow and increase in knowledge and in spiritual
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.520]   understanding.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.040]   Turn to the epistle to the Colossians in the first chapter, his petition is exactly the
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.440]   same.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:54.040]   What the Apostle always prayed for his converts was this, that they might come to know God.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.800]   He's not thinking primarily about subjective states and conditions in them.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.560]   He's thinking about them in their total relationship to the Almighty God.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:13.440]   Now, I'm suggesting solemnly that there is a grave danger of our forgetting this and
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.600]   our emphasis becoming false.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.440]   May we ever follow the apostolic pattern and put things in the order in which the Apostle
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.440]   puts them.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.080]   Later on in this epistle, he has a great deal to say about sanctification, but he doesn't
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.080]   start with it.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.800]   He's got a lot to say about happiness and joy and so on, but he doesn't start with
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.040]   it.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.240]   He starts where we should always start, and God forbid that we should ever start anywhere
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   else.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   Well, what is the petition?
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.800]   Well, here it is, that they may have this spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   of him.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.000]   Now, what does he mean by this?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.200]   What is this knowledge?
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.680]   The first thing we have to get quite clear, perhaps, is the him who is mentioned here,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.840]   the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   Who is that?
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.720]   Well, there are some who seem to think that that's a reference to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.360]   but I think that that's quite wrong.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.840]   It is clearly a reference to God the Father.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.400]   Surely the whole context indicates that quite clearly.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:26.200]   He is praying to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that he may give
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.240]   unto you this spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, the same person,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.760]   the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that he may know what?
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.880]   Well, what is the hope of his calling?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.160]   Well, who does the calling?
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.240]   We've already seen.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.400]   It is God himself who calls us.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.760]   It's God who's chosen us.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.460]   It's God who's predestinated us.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.760]   It's all along the action of the Father.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   And then the exceeding riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.040]   And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward?
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   Who is this?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   It is still God the Father.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.720]   I prove it like this.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:07.760]   His power to us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.800]   wrought in Christ.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.640]   The he, you see, all along is a reference to God the Father.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:22.960]   So that here the knowledge about which the apostle is speaking is primarily and essentially
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.520]   a knowledge of God the Eternal Father.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Of course, as the apostle makes quite plain in this epistle, as the New Testament makes
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:41.440]   plain everywhere, this knowledge is only possible to us in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.520]   So that there is a sense in which you can't separate.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.720]   And the knowledge which we have, as our Lord himself says in his high priestly prayer,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.440]   is a knowledge of the Father and of the Son.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.600]   This is life eternal that they may know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   hast sent.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.880]   Or, as this apostle puts it in writing to the Corinthians in his second epistle in the
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:10.960]   fourth chapter, "God who commended the light to shine out of darkness hath shined
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.320]   in our hearts"—what for?—"to reveal the light of the knowledge of the glory of
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.600]   God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.800]   Yes, it's the knowledge of the glory of God, this Father of glory to whom he's praying,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.760]   in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.840]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.120]   The only begotten was in the bosom of the Father.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   He hath declared.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.200]   Yes, it's mediated, it's possible, in and through our blessed Saviour.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:49.860]   But the knowledge, ultimately, is a knowledge of God himself.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:58.940]   Very well then, my friends, we are here this morning, face to face, with the highest reaches
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.160]   of our Christian faith and our Christian life.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:10.360]   God knows how conscious I am of my inadequacy as I attempt to deal with such a theme and
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.000]   to hold it before you.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.840]   But it is the thing for which the apostle prayed for all these Christians, these young
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   Christians at Ephesus.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.760]   It's the prayer for all Christians, therefore, always and at all times.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.880]   What is it he desires for us?
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.320]   What is it we should be seeking this morning?
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:36.920]   Well it's this, it is knowledge of God.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.360]   Now let's look at this term "knowledge".
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   It's a very strong, it's a very powerful term.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.280]   Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.440]   Do we realize, I wonder, the full sense and connotation of this term "knowledge"?
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.880]   It doesn't merely mean a casual, cursory acquaintance.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.320]   It doesn't just mean a superficial knowledge of something.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.400]   There is such a knowledge, of course, there is just ordinary knowing.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.520]   That isn't what the apostle means, it isn't the term he used.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   He used a term which conveys these ideas, that it's accurate knowledge, it's exact
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:29.400]   knowledge, it is certain knowledge, it is experimental knowledge, it is profound knowledge.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:36.960]   He couldn't have used a stronger term, it's epignosis, it's the fullest knowledge that
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.280]   we can think of.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.040]   That's the term that the apostle deliberately uses.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:51.120]   And his prayer for these people is that they may come to such a knowledge of God.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.520]   Here they are still on earth, many of them probably slaves, as they were in those first
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   centuries.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.760]   Ordinary people, perhaps ignorant and uneducated and illiterate, doesn't matter.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.920]   What he prays is that they may come to this full knowledge, this full of knowledge, this
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:16.000]   accurate, precise, exact, experimental knowledge of the one whom he has just described as not
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.880]   only the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, but the ineffable Father of glory.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.320]   Well, now then, what does it mean?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.600]   Well, let me start by emphasizing the negative.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.240]   He's not praying that we may have a theoretical or an intellectual knowledge only of God.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.520]   There is such a knowledge, and such a knowledge is very important.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   God has revealed himself in order that we might know him in this sense.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   He has manifested himself, he's done so in nature, he's done so in history, he does
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.280]   so in providence, but supremely he does so in this world.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.560]   The giving of the Ten Commandments and the moral law was in order to instruct people
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.440]   as to the nature and the being and the character of God.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.280]   The trouble with men always is his ignorance of God.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:18.120]   So God has given us this type of knowledge, and it is important, it is essential.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.040]   But that isn't the knowledge which the apostle has in mind here.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.520]   That is what you may call, if you like, propositional knowledge, and let no one despise propositional
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   knowledge.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.480]   It is important that we should know something about the attributes of God, and the great
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.200]   period in the religious life of this country, the Puritan era, you will find those great
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.920]   writers were constantly dealing with this question of the attributes of God, his eternity,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.840]   his omnipresence, his omnipotence, and so on.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.340]   We must know all that.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:56.840]   But that is what I would describe as theoretical or intellectual, notional, propositional knowledge,
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.200]   and the apostle, while he includes that, goes well beyond it.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.320]   He doesn't stop at that.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:11.840]   Or to put it in another form, when he talks here about our coming to a knowledge of God,
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.320]   he doesn't just mean that we should know a number of things about God.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   And there is a very good reason for this.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.540]   You remember how James puts this once and forever in his epistle.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.380]   He says, you know, I'm not concerned about that sort of knowledge.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.100]   The devils believe and tremble.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.480]   They've got that sort of knowledge of God.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.320]   The devils are not ignorant about the greatness and the might and the majesty of God.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   The devils believe in God in that sense, but that isn't knowledge of God in this sense,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.920]   because that knowledge only leads to trembling.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.540]   That leads to a craven fear.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.360]   That's a terrible knowledge, in a sense.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.340]   That isn't the thing the apostle is praying for.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:58.440]   So we don't stop at just knowing certain things that are true about God.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.660]   We need to know them.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:08.040]   We need to know that he is the creator of the ends of the earth, that he is the judge
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:14.720]   of the world, that he is almighty and everlasting.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.080]   It is our ignorance about these truths concerning God that accounts for so much superficiality
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.440]   and glibness often in our Christian life.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.040]   There is no fear of God before our eyes.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.800]   We are not godly men and women as our fathers once were.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.320]   It's our ignorance of God.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.880]   But you see, the apostle doesn't stop at that.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:41.560]   Neither does he mean by it a knowledge of the blessings that God gives.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.520]   I can prove that to you very easily.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.240]   Later on, he's going to deal with those.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.360]   He's got a threefold petition here.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.720]   He says that they may know in particular what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.000]   of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what the exceeding greatness of his power
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   toward us would that believe.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.960]   There are the particular blessings, but here he hasn't come to that.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.720]   This is general at this point.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.120]   So I think we must be clear in our minds that when he prays for this knowledge, that he
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.600]   is not concerned with those three particular aspects.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.320]   What is he concerned about then?
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:23.040]   Well, this is the staggering and astounding thing.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:34.960]   He is concerned that we have an immediate knowledge of God, that we have a real acquaintance
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.200]   with God.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.800]   He is concerned that we should meet with God.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:51.520]   He is concerned that we should have, if you like, an encounter with God.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:59.840]   He means a knowledge of God which is personal and intimate.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.520]   Now whatever views we may hold of certain modern tendencies in theological teaching,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:10.280]   at any rate we must agree that this is a good emphasis which is coming back to this idea
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:17.480]   of the divine human encounter, to this idea of meeting with God, this existential moment
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:23.640]   when I know that God is there and I am here, the thou I or the I thou.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:31.800]   That's the thing the apostle is talking about, not mere theory, not mere notion, not
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:40.840]   something abstract, not something academic, but personal, immediate, a real meeting.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.560]   That's the knowledge of God.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.360]   Or let me try and put it in other terms.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:52.720]   It's almost impossible to put it into terms, but it does mean something like this.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:26:04.000]   It means that God should be real to us and that we should be conscious of him and conscious
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.560]   of his presence.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.600]   Oh, I make no apology, my dear friends.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.880]   The matter is so vitally important I make no apology for asking a simple question.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.000]   Have you ever known that?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.520]   Is God real to you?
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:26.080]   When you get on your knees and pray, do you know that God is there?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.000]   Do you realize his presence?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.840]   That's the thing the apostle is speaking about.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.360]   He means, you see, that we know and realize something of the glory of God.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.080]   That's why he was so careful in praying to say that he's praying to the God of our
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, the God we were trying to look at last Sunday
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.680]   morning in his ineffable glory.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.440]   He says, "I want you to know him, therefore to know something of that glory, to be conscious
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.280]   of it, to feel it, to be aware of it."
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   That's what he means by knowledge.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.660]   Have you ever felt and sensed something of the glory of God?
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:22.760]   Do you know anything of what Jacob said when he said, "This is an awful place, full of
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.600]   all, the presence, the glory"?
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:35.820]   It means, you see, that we know and realize something about the love of God.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:41.120]   Because you can't realize the presence of God without this awareness of the glory and
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.520]   also of this love of God, for God is love.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:52.300]   And again, not merely in general but in particular, it means that we begin to know something of
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:58.240]   and to experience directly and personally God's love.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.700]   You see, to know a person means something beyond the casual acquaintance.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.180]   You say, "I know so and so."
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.700]   What you mean is that you were once introduced to him, spoke a few words to him, but that's
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.180]   not knowing a person.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.340]   That's merely being acquainted with a person.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.380]   When this term "knowledge" is used here in the scriptures, it means an intimate knowledge.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.260]   Take how it's used of God in his knowledge of us.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.460]   God says to the children of Israel through the prophet Amos in the third chapter, "You
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.180]   only have I known of all the nations of the world."
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.260]   Well, obviously, he doesn't mean by that that he wasn't aware of the existence of
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.140]   the others, for God knows all nations and knows everything.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.660]   No, when he says, "You only have I known," what he means is this, "You only have I
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:47.020]   known in this particular, immediate, personal, intimate sense, I'm taking a special interest
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   in you."
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.200]   That's the word that's used here, that's knowledge.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.940]   So the apostle was praying that these Ephesians might know the love of God to them themselves
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.220]   and might know and feel his love.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:07.100]   Well, let me try and sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:14.300]   It means, you see, having fellowship with him, fellowship with God in a true and in
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.460]   a real sense.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.980]   Let me quote you those two great statements again.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:28.300]   "This is life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   thou hast sent."
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.580]   The Jews knew about him, they'd been trained in the law, they'd had their scriptures,
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.580]   they knew that.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.180]   That isn't what our Lord's talking about.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:42.060]   Life eternal is something new, it's to know God and to know Jesus Christ, or as John puts
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:51.980]   it, look at this old man, this old apostle, he's on the point of death and he writes
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   a letter to these people who are so dear to him.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.580]   He calls them his little children.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:03.820]   He says, "I write to you and I write to you that your joy may be full.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.460]   You're going to have hard times, there will be difficulties in the church and outside,
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.100]   the world is full of tribulation, but I write that your joy may be full."
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.500]   And what does he want them to have?
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.020]   Well, he says, "I'm writing these things in order that you may have fellowship with
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.020]   us, with us the apostles."
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:27.300]   "What do I mean by that?" he asks, and answers his own question, and truly, "Our
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:35.980]   fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:43.740]   A fellowship, a communion, an intimacy, a partnership, a sharing of the same life.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:49.700]   Now that's the idea, and that's the connotation of this great word "knowledge," a knowledge
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.260]   of God in that sense.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:59.620]   And you see, we can very easily discover whether we know anything about it or not in this way.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:08.260]   Anybody who knows anything about this has a sense of privilege, a sense of wonder, a
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.540]   sense of praise, and a sense of glory.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:18.220]   My dear friends, do we realize that this is what Christianity really means, coming to
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.940]   us with such a knowledge of God?
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.880]   Let me try to put it still more plainly by putting it to you in terms of certain illustrations
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.340]   from Scripture.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:33.980]   The Apostle Isaiah prays that these Ephesians might have the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.100]   in the knowledge of God.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   What is it?
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:43.060]   Well, it's the kind of thing, you see, that Job meant when he said this, "Oh, that I
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.780]   knew where I might find him."
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.900]   He hasn't lost his theoretical knowledge of God, he's got it.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.140]   He hasn't ceased to know about the attributes of God and about the mightiness and about
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   the works of God.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.980]   That isn't what Job is seeking.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.660]   Job had experienced fellowship and communion with God, but for the time being he's lost
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   it.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.980]   And what's he seeking?
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:12.300]   Well, he's seeking the person, "Oh, that I knew where I might find him."
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.020]   And the same thing exactly when later on he puts it like this, when the Lord did manifest
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.020]   and reveal himself to him, Job says, "I have heard of thee with the hearing of the
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:29.940]   ear, but now mine eye hath seen thee."
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   He knew about him.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.940]   "I have heard of thee.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.940]   I've listened to the sermons the Ephesians.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   I've listened to the Scriptures being read.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.940]   I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear, but now there's something more."
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:42.820]   And he puts his hand upon his mouth, "What can I say?"
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.740]   He's sorry that he's spoken so much.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.740]   He's in the presence of God.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.980]   He knows.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   That's the thing.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:59.180]   It's, of course, exactly the same thing that Moses had in mind when he used this kind
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:07.740]   of expression, God had given him that great and important task.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:14.060]   And Moses, the meekest of men, conscious of his own utter inadequacy, says, "If thy
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:21.060]   presence go not with me, carry us not up hence."
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.220]   Then he is satisfied with that.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:30.500]   "Rising with great daring," he turns to God and he says, "show me thy glory."
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.620]   That's it.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.620]   Have you ever felt that?
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.460]   Have you ever felt that desire?
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.420]   That's the thing the apostles pray, that these Ephesians may begin to hunger and thirst
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.620]   for that, may realize that all that's happened to them has been designed for that end, that
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.620]   they may see and know the glory of God, this Father of glory.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.380]   "Show me thy glory."
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:34:00.020]   Or, if you like, it's the thing that the psalmist expresses so perfectly in that forty-second
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.900]   psalm which we read together at the beginning, "As the heart panteth after the water brooks,
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:14.260]   so panteth my heart after thee, O God, my soul thirsteth for God, for the living God,
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:20.020]   not the God of theology, as it were, not the God of the textbook, not the God of propositions,
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:28.580]   not the God about whom I know things, for the living God, the personal God."
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.660]   His soul was thirsting for him.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:39.260]   He was panting after that knowledge, "As the heart panteth after the water brooks."
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.540]   That's knowledge of God, my friends, not indirect but direct, not a knowledge about
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.060]   but immediate, personal.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:53.460]   It's the kind of thing that Isaiah speaks about in the sixth chapter of his prophecy
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:59.660]   when he says, "I saw the Lord that particular year when the king died, I saw the Lord sitting
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:06.460]   upon the throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple, and the house was
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:11.660]   filled with smoke, and the post of the door moved, the glory of God."
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:19.940]   And he says, "What am I and who am I, I am a man of unclean lips, woe is me."
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.140]   He has been in the presence of the glory.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:29.340]   He has felt it, he has sensed it, that's the knowledge.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:35.660]   But you know it's the same thing that our blessed Lord himself taught.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.300]   Listen to him saying this, you'll find it in the eleventh chapter of Matthew's gospel
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.900]   in the twenty-seventh verse, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:58.660]   man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:04.860]   he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him."
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   That's it.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:12.720]   That's what our Lord has come to do, that is salvation, that he should reveal the Father
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.940]   to us.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:28.380]   Or again, listen to him putting it like this, "If a man love me, he will keep my words.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:41.620]   And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him, we,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.900]   the Father and the Son."
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.500]   That's Christianity, the life of God in the souls of men, the Father and the Son coming
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.100]   and making their abode within us.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:59.260]   Listen to him finally putting it in his high priestly prayer again, he's praying, "That
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:14.700]   men may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me."
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   That's the knowledge.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:22.020]   Very well then, my friends, that's the thing for which the apostle prays for these Ephesians,
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.780]   that they may have this spirit of wisdom and revelation in their knowledge of God.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.220]   I asked the question at the beginning, I said, "Is it possible that the apostle can desire
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.700]   anything more for these Ephesians?
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.280]   They've believed, they're trusting, they've got faith, more, they've been sealed with
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   the Spirit.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.180]   Is there anything beyond sealing with the Spirit?"
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.180]   Yes, this.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.060]   What's the difference?
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.260]   Well, I take it it's this.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:38:02.980]   In the sealing with the Spirit, we are given to know that we are His.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.140]   It is the Holy Spirit bearing witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:15.180]   It is God saying to us, "Thou art my Son, my Child."
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.980]   It's amazing, it's wonderful.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.660]   That's the sealing with the Spirit, to know that I am a child of God.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.300]   Is there anything beyond that?
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.500]   Yes, it's this.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.420]   It is to know God Himself.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.580]   That is the highest of all.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.340]   It's a wonderful thing to know that I belong to God.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:40.660]   It's an infinitely greater thing to know God Himself.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:49.900]   And that is the knowledge for which the apostle here prays for these Ephesian Christians.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.340]   I therefore leave you with just this word.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:04.460]   This is a knowledge that is possible to all Christians.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.820]   If we don't receive that, I have preached in vain.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:14.020]   And that is where the danger of certain types of soul culture come in.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.700]   The Roman Catholic Church and all Catholic teaching doesn't hesitate to say that what
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.800]   I've just said, of course, is nonsense.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.940]   They divide Christians up into two groups, the religious and the laity, those who go
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.180]   in and become specialists in the religious life, the mystics, the saints, the people
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:37.340]   who forsake the world and segregate themselves from society and give themselves only always
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:43.900]   to this, to prayer, meditation, mortification, contemplation, the dark night of the soul,
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.300]   and ultimately to the beatific vision.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.500]   What they say, a man in business, a man in affairs, an ordinary Christian, how can he
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.980]   attain to such a knowledge?
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.220]   It all depends, they say, upon the man himself.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:02.160]   That as I understand the teaching of the scripture, my friends, is terrible heresy.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.620]   And God forbid that any of us should succumb to it.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.300]   We needn't go further than this very prayer of the apostle.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.820]   He is offering this prayer for all the members of the church at Ephesus.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.580]   He's not praying for apostles.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.300]   He's not praying for elders only.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:21.540]   He's praying for them all, that they all may have this spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.820]   in the knowledge of him.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:29.260]   And of course, it's the thing that's been promised under the new covenant.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.520]   Do you remember the promise that God gave of the new covenant which he would make?
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.660]   He gave it through the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:40.600]   You'll find it in the 31st chapter of Jeremiah's prophecy, but you'll find it quoted twice
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.360]   in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.540]   It's in the 8th chapter and again in the 10th.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:50.940]   Listen, this is what God says will happen in the new dispensation, when the new covenant
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.180]   is made, when the Christ has come and has worked out his salvation.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.860]   Listen, this is what he promises.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:05.500]   And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:18.300]   law, for all shall know me from the least to the greatest.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:26.180]   That's the new covenant, not the old covenant that he made through Moses, but the new covenant
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.100]   in Christ, and this is its characteristic.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:35.180]   All shall know me, and when the Holy Spirit comes, your young men shall see dreams, they
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:43.100]   shall prophesy, it isn't confined to certain, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:51.380]   They shall all know me, from the least unto the greatest.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.060]   It is a knowledge that is possible to all.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.180]   And thank God the history of the church throughout the centuries confirms this.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:07.800]   This is not a matter of intellectual understanding, it doesn't depend upon circumstances and
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   conditions.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.460]   There is only one thing that controls this, and that is the realization that it's possible,
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.420]   and then the desire for it.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:24.260]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:31.340]   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:42.580]   My dear friends, I ask you a solemn and a profound question, do you know God?
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.180]   I'm not asking if you believe things about him.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:52.500]   I have to use such a term, have you met him?
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.460]   Do you know yourself for certain in his presence?
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:04.860]   Does he speak to you, and do you know that you speak to him?
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.500]   Practice of the presence of God.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.740]   Your brother Lawrence in the kitchen, washing the dishes, yes, practicing the presence of
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   God.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.460]   It doesn't matter where you are, as long as you know that this is possible, that Christ
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:23.980]   died to make it possible, he died to bring us to God, and to this knowledge he gives
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:31.460]   eternal life, which is to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:41.860]   is your fellowship with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:48.820]   All that we might know, God, begin to cry all the time, you, where I might find you,
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.980]   and your heart will begin to panic, you'll be desiring, you'll be hungering, you'll
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   be thirsting.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:05.940]   More and more, if I may put it in this personal word, more and more what I look for in men
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:15.500]   is this, have they got a soul thirst for God?
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.940]   Are they longing for this?
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:23.540]   Is there something about them that always tells you that they're always waiting for
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:32.500]   his next appearance, for the further manifestation, that their life is centered on him, and that
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:39.620]   with Paul they forget everything in the past, and press forward more and more, that they
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:47.980]   might know him, and that the knowledge might increase, until eventually, beyond death and
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:57.060]   the grave and death life, we shall know him, even as we are already known of him, and shall
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:09.180]   see him, not as now in a glass dark room, but then, face to face, we shall see the Father
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.940]   of God.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.180]   Amen.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.100]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
