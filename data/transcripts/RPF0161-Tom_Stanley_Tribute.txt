[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.320]   of Dr. Tom Stanley, author of The Millionaire Next Door.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.580]   He died tragically yesterday in a car accident in Atlanta.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.680]   And today I wanna honor his legacy
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.460]   with the 10 lessons that I learned from his work
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820]   and some personal stories of how he encouraged and helped me.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:18.940]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.920]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.220]   Today is Monday, March 2nd, 2015.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.380]   Today we will be honoring the life
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.900]   and legacy of Dr. Tom Stanley.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.420]   I can't think of an author or a body of work
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.980]   that has had a greater impact on my life
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.420]   and on my personal financial philosophy
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.100]   than his body of work.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100]   And I wanna share with you some of the lessons
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.260]   that I learned from him.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.300]   Last night I was looking on my,
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.900]   I had a notification pop up on my Facebook feed
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.020]   from a listener of the show who shared an article with me.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.060]   And he said, "I know that you were a fan of,
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.540]   "are a fan of Dr. Tom Stanley.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.100]   "I thought you would wanna know the news."
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.340]   And evidently he died tragically on Sunday afternoon
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.300]   out driving his car on Sunday afternoon
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.980]   there in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.180]   And the details of the car accident
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.540]   are not necessarily fully disclosed
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.540]   in some of the news articles.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.680]   You can find some of the details.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.140]   Evidently he was out for a Sunday afternoon drive
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.660]   in his new Chevy Corvette
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.420]   and somebody plowed into the side of him.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.260]   Thankfully it wasn't any kind of accident that makes you,
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.340]   it was certainly tragic,
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.940]   but thankfully it wasn't the kind of accident
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.100]   that makes you upset when people are out
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.460]   doing foolish things in cars,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.060]   driving at 300 miles an hour or something like that.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.820]   Any death is sad and those are especially sad
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.140]   in this situation.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.900]   It's quite tragic 'cause it seems the other driver
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.220]   was fully at fault and Dr. Stanley was not.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.620]   But he died yesterday and he was at the age of 71.
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.840]   And it's very sad.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.220]   It's always hard for me to know how to deal with things
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.820]   when people you don't really know die.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820]   So, but I'll tell you a little bit,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.020]   some of the personal history.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.100]   I never met him, but I did have some interaction with him
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   that I'll share with you in today's show.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.280]   But as I was reflecting on his life and on his work,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.220]   I was thinking through some of the philosophies
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.540]   that I hold around financial planning
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.340]   and was looking at his books here on my shelf
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100]   and I got a few of them down and kind of flipped through
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.300]   them to see some of my notes and my highlights
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.780]   and my learnings over the years.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.200]   And I realized that he's probably the author
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.940]   who more than anyone else has had a greater impact
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.680]   on my life and on my thinking.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.980]   The first book of his that I ever read,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980]   I'm sure was "The Millionaire Next Door."
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.020]   And I have no idea how it was recommended to me.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.020]   But when I was very young,
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.920]   I must have been in high school still,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.340]   I read "The Millionaire Next Door" and then I reread it.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.940]   And I've reread it multiple times over the decades.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.020]   In fact, I had the audio book,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.380]   it was the abridged audio book,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.220]   but I used to listen to the abridged audio book
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.060]   from time to time.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.780]   It was one of the audio books that was in my car
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.820]   and every now and then I would just listen to it.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.740]   That and let's see, "How to Win Friends and Influence People"
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.500]   was another audio book that I referred to
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   again and again and again.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.820]   I commend both of them to you.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.660]   Just excellent, excellent works.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.500]   I've owned six of his books and read six of his books.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.020]   He has either two or three that I haven't read yet.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.380]   But it started with "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.640]   which was his first and most famous work.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.980]   Also, I read that,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.940]   and that was essentially a book profiling
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.420]   who are the wealthy in the United States of America.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.260]   And I'm gonna share that with you in today's show.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.380]   Also, I read a book called "The Millionaire Mind,"
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.540]   and that was a book where he profiled
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.900]   Deca millionaires and up,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.220]   and that was an excellent book.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.780]   I learned a lot from that.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.460]   Then I read his three books called,
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.220]   which are very, not very well known,
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.400]   but extremely useful.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.860]   I'm always surprised that people don't know about them.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.640]   But a book called "Selling to the Affluent,"
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.700]   another one called "Marketing to the Affluent,"
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.940]   and a third called "Networking with the Affluent."
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.620]   And then finally I read his book,
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.880]   which was published a few years ago,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.620]   called "Stop Acting Rich."
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.260]   And he's got at least another book or two.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.900]   One is called "The Millionaire Women Next Door."
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.860]   I have not read that.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.380]   It's been on my list for a long time,
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.820]   and I will certainly now read it just to see.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.980]   But I can't remember if he has another book or two as well.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.000]   But his works have had a big influence on me.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.180]   And even just he himself influenced
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.420]   one significant decision in my life.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.620]   And I'll just share that with you.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.740]   And it's good to honor people.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.460]   I like to honor people.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.740]   And I tried to honor him while he was alive.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.980]   In fact, I had reached out to him
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.700]   on the show a couple-- once, twice, actually, twice,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.780]   inviting him on the show for an interview.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.980]   And his staff declined me.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.940]   And it was perfectly understandable.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.660]   There's no-- it was not-- it was a very polite decline.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.500]   But I'd always hoped that at some point
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.020]   radical personal finance would grow
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.780]   and would be a valuable outlet for him
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.500]   and that I would be able to bring him on.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.460]   And I'm disappointed that I won't have that opportunity now.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.620]   But I went back and checked my email.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.180]   And that's one of the good things about the Gmail system,
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.020]   where all of your emails are archived
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.620]   and they're relatively easy to search.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.940]   And I found some of the interaction
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.940]   that I had with him.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.900]   And in 2009, July of 2009-- so I went
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.180]   into the financial planning business in the fall of 2008.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.700]   The exact start date is a little bit fuzzy,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.220]   depending on September, October, November,
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.740]   depending on where I say it.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.340]   So it's basically the fall of 2008.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.220]   And I was working hard to try to figure out
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.660]   the financial planning business.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.980]   It's a tough business to get in.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.740]   And I was new to it.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.660]   I didn't have any experience.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.400]   I was trying to figure out, where do I go?
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.620]   And what do I do?
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.420]   And I started looking around.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.180]   And at some point in time, I started
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.140]   working on Dr. Stanley's blog and trying to understand it.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.380]   And I wrote him a note.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.620]   And I can't find the actual note that I wrote him.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.020]   But he responded to my correspondence.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.660]   And the question that I had asked him--
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.360]   I think I'd asked him for some resources
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.900]   or some specific resources that he
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.300]   might have written that would help financial advisors.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.460]   And he wrote me this email back.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.140]   It's very short.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.900]   It was July 19, 2009.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.540]   He said, Joshua, can't thank you enough for your kind comments
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.700]   on my blog.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.780]   Words like yours sustain me.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.020]   Two of the best-rated speeches that I've ever given
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.680]   were to the top of the table and later
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.540]   at the court of the table, as you know,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.260]   part of the Million Dollar Roundtable Association.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.620]   Both of those speeches were recorded audio
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.820]   and, as I understand, were distributed by the Million
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.580]   Dollar Roundtable.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.060]   I would also suggest that you read the chapter on Beverly
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.700]   Bishop in my book, Millionaire Women Next Door,
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.900]   and also selling to the affluent should be very
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.740]   valuable to you in your work.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.580]   I'll know better about my speaking programs
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.380]   in September.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.660]   Please continue to check my website for updates.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.980]   Regards and much continued success, Tom Stanley.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.420]   And I just thought it was extremely
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.820]   professional and encouraging note.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.260]   And I went and looked up the speeches that he had done
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.140]   and tried to find the audio from them.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.720]   I don't think I was able to get them,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.900]   or I chose not to buy them.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.940]   But I went and looked them up, and I
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.280]   thought it was extremely useful.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.300]   But probably the more impactful correspondence for me
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.340]   occurred in August of 2010.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.380]   And at that point in time, I had been in the financial planning
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.580]   business for a couple of years.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.220]   And I was starting to experience a little bit of success.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.860]   And I spent the first two years in the business--
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.980]   I started with nothing, and I didn't know very much.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.980]   I didn't have much money.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.220]   I had a little bit of money, but I had just gotten out
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.060]   of college, and I was driving an inexpensive car.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.700]   And I've told the story before, so forgive me
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.420]   if it's repeated.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.060]   But I spent the first two years as a financial advisor
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.580]   driving a 1993 Honda Accord with 300,000 miles on it.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.960]   And it was the first car that I had ever personally bought.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.120]   I'd owned it for many years.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.500]   I'd bought it with 193,000 miles on it.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.860]   I ultimately sold it with 315,000 miles on it.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.100]   But it was only worth $1,000 or $2,000.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.260]   And so I remember driving it to all my financial planning
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.220]   appointments.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.820]   And when you're a new financial advisor,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.860]   it's really tough to understand what to be proud of
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.300]   or what not to be proud of.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.580]   And so certainly, you can imagine
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580]   if a financial advisor drives up to your house
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.180]   and parks this $1,000 Honda Accord in your driveway,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.500]   to some people, they look at that and say, this is different.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.220]   And their curiosity is piqued.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.740]   And some people look at that and say, this is different.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.860]   And they are a little bit-- they might judge you,
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.220]   because appearances matter.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.100]   And they might judge you in a negative light.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.860]   And so I'd reached the time in 2010,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.600]   my car was starting to have some problems.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.460]   And it had had some minor mechanical failures.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.500]   And I'd saved some money.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.220]   I had, I don't know, $10,000 or $15,000 saved.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.780]   And I knew I needed to do something.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.140]   At that point, I was starting to transition my practice
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.100]   from primarily insurance sales into investment planning
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.060]   and investment management.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.380]   And I was starting to feel pretty insecure about my car.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.740]   And as much as I would have liked
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.700]   to have been completely secure, I wasn't.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.460]   I was starting to be a little bit insecure
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.180]   and just feel like maybe I was-- it was hurtful.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.780]   It was going to hurt my ability to bring in accounts
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.500]   or something like that.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.940]   Sometimes, if it was convenient, I
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.740]   would make sure to park around the corner.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.060]   Usually, I didn't do much with people's houses.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.060]   But I would park on the other side of the parking lot
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.820]   or around the corner kind of thing to kind of mitigate that.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.900]   And that's just not good for your self-confidence.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.780]   If you have a perceived flaw like that,
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.260]   you either need to come to terms with it or overcome it.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.860]   So I was deciding I needed to get a car.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.740]   And I was shopping around and trying to figure out,
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.220]   how do I get a car for $10,000?
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.860]   And that's a very difficult price range
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.260]   to find a reasonable car.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.620]   And it's easy to find a new one.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.180]   But I didn't want to borrow money for a car.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.820]   And I needed something that was going
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.580]   to be appropriate for what I wanted to do.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.100]   And I had no idea what would be appropriate.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.300]   I actually almost wound up--
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.700]   I was trying to buy something that would look impressive
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.620]   to people.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.780]   And I almost-- thankfully, I avoided this mistake
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.780]   by the skin of my teeth.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.100]   But I almost wound up buying a few-year-old Mercedes sedan
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.140]   that would have been kind of fancy enough to--
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.540]   all financial advisors drive BMWs and Mercedes.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.100]   It's absurd.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.780]   But it would fit the market, but would
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.380]   allow me to pay cash for it and not spend too much.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.540]   Thankfully, I avoided that.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.040]   But at one point, I thought, you know what?
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.700]   I should just write to Dr. Stanley
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.980]   and ask him what kind of car I should write.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.500]   So on August-- or actually, I should drive.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.660]   On August 19, 2010, I wrote him this email.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.820]   I just said, Mr. Stanley, one very brief question.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.740]   What do you think would be the best kind of car
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.700]   for a financial advisor to drive?
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.780]   I don't believe in status cars.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.500]   But I live and work as a financial advisor
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   in West Palm Beach and the Palm Beach and surrounding area.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.100]   And here, everyone, even or especially the broke people,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.100]   have status cars.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.260]   What should I do?
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.300]   Joshua.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.380]   And he wrote me back.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.260]   And a couple days later, and he said, dear Mr. Sheets,
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.620]   and just gave me this direction here, which was so helpful.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.580]   And he wrote this.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.700]   He said, if I were in your position,
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.540]   I would buy a previously owned Chevrolet Tahoe or the GMC
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.380]   version in white, leather interior with tinted windows.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.700]   These cars fit in each and every category of the wealthy.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.660]   They are among the most popular cars
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.620]   within the glittering rich, very affluent segments.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.340]   Regards, Tom Stanley.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.780]   And that email right there saved me untold thousands of dollars.
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.220]   Talk about the value of information.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.740]   Those two sentences saved me thousands of dollars,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.580]   where instead of--
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.460]   I had been previously thinking, well,
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.180]   how can I find a reasonable Mercedes or BMW?
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.380]   And I didn't want to deal with the maintenance costs
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.140]   and just the cost of ownership.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.460]   And that email right there opened my eyes
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.940]   to the thought of SUVs.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.900]   And I realized instantly, I knew he was right.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.180]   Because you drive around Palm Beach Island,
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.620]   and I take people for tours around Palm Beach Island.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.740]   Yes, usually there's some fancy Mercedes or BMW or Jaguar
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.460]   or Bentley or whatever, some status cars.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.020]   But oftentimes, there's one or two just big SUVs parked there.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.060]   I mean, after all, the president of United States
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   drives around in a weird Cadillac limo.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.900]   But everyone else around him is driving big Suburbans.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.580]   It's a very easy vehicle to use.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.820]   And I thought, interesting.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.140]   So I started shopping.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.900]   I didn't wind up buying a Chevy Suburban or a Tahoe,
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.660]   as he recommended.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.780]   I wound up buying a Ford Expedition.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.660]   And it worked perfectly for what I needed.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.780]   It was that perfect gray man car, that perfect thing
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.620]   where no one would ever look at me and say--
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.100]   and they would say, oh, he's just driving that car
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.180]   because he has too much money, and he's showing it off.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.980]   Because there's a very delicate balance between being
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.980]   too showy and too flashy.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.540]   What do you think of a financial advisor that drives up
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.820]   in a Ferrari every day?
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.700]   Maybe that works for some.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.660]   But it reminds me more of the statement of the guy who
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.940]   goes to Manhattan, and someone says,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.480]   there's all of the broker's yachts.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.780]   And he says, we're all the customer's yachts.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.740]   It's a famous saying.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.680]   And it's kind of a bit of a strong statement,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.660]   but probably true in many ways.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.280]   The financial advisor is the one getting rich,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   but what about the customers that are getting rich?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.820]   So I didn't want to be too flashy.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.320]   But on the other hand, I didn't want
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.980]   to be driving this broken down $1,000 car.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.620]   That wasn't appropriate at that stage.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.460]   It may have been appropriate to get started.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.860]   And I certainly am glad I didn't just rush out and buy
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.260]   a brand new car just so I can present
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.700]   an appearance of being established in the business.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.420]   I don't mind learning the hard way.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.620]   But I found the Expedition.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.940]   It was the perfect gray man car.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.340]   And it didn't cost that much.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.060]   Those things depreciate like crazy.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.700]   So I bought it--
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.040]   I think it was three or four years old when I bought it.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.100]   And it was less than a third of the retail price
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.380]   when it was new.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.860]   So that was a massive--
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.460]   it was a good buy there.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.020]   It was heavy on gas, which was the downside.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.860]   But it was cheap to fix, cheap to operate.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.500]   It worked, served me well.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.260]   It was comfortable.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.860]   I'm a big guy.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.980]   I'm about 6 foot 6.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.420]   And I'm over 300 pounds.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.660]   So it fit me well.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.260]   And at a relatively cheap price, relative to buying a $40,000
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.540]   BMW, it solved that problem I had.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.220]   And I was so thankful for that.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.900]   Avoided a very important mistake.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.100]   I just wanted to share that story, because I really
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.660]   appreciated that at the time.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.460]   And I, of course, thanked him.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.820]   And I would have liked to have had the opportunity
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   to thank him in person.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.980]   But at least I can thank him here publicly,
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.420]   as he was extremely classy.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.140]   And Dr. Stanley, from everything I've heard and read
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.660]   about him, he was the kind of person
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.620]   that I'd like to be when I'm older.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.620]   I often think of, who do I want to be when I'm--
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.100]   I don't have that image of me as an old man.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.380]   And I think, what do I want to be like at that person?
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.540]   What kind of character do I want to have?
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.100]   And again, I know nothing about his personal life.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.100]   And I don't need to know anything about.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.780]   But his reputation, at least, was a real gentleman.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.380]   And enough of that came through in his writings
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.300]   that I really picked up on that.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.460]   And I appreciated so many things about his writings.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.260]   And I'm sure I will do--
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.260]   he's been on my show topic list for a long time
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.620]   to talk about some of the lessons
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.980]   that I learned from his work.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.860]   But today, I just sat down and I penned out 10 lessons
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.820]   that I learned from him that I think
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.580]   are good general lessons that I can share with you,
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.220]   and things that were a real encouragement to me.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.980]   And who knows?
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.980]   Perhaps at some point, maybe this audio
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.220]   can reach his family after the tears have dried a little bit
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.060]   and the funeral is over and time passes.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.380]   Perhaps some of his family members can listen to this
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.860]   and just appreciate the impact that their husband, or father,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.820]   or grandfather--
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.220]   I don't know any of the details-- had on many people.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.660]   But the first lesson that Dr. Stanley taught me
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.460]   was he taught me who the millionaires are.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.700]   This was an incredibly important lesson.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.740]   Because if I asked you, what is the profile of a millionaire?
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.780]   Unless you had studied this topic,
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.940]   you might not give the right answer.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.660]   The people we think of as being the average millionaire--
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.660]   and this is why his book was such a probably blockbuster
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.700]   success-- that's not who he said was the average millionaire.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.660]   And the most valuable thing about his work
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.820]   was he backed this up with numbers, data, and statistics.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.900]   That was how he got his start was researching this.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.340]   He was a college professor.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.820]   And if I've got the story straight,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.660]   he was researching it for a large project.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.900]   He and his co-author of The Millionaire Next Door,
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.220]   Dr. William Danko, were researching this
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.060]   for a large financial services organization.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.380]   And that research became the foundation of, ultimately,
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.020]   all of their work in this area.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.220]   But let me read to you the portrait of a millionaire
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.620]   so that you can have in your mind who the wealthy are,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.980]   who the millionaires are, at least in the United States
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.500]   of America.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.580]   And my bet is that this is similar in most
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.700]   of the countries of the world, of course,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.820]   with some cultural distinctions depending
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.780]   on the economic system and the history of the culture.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.060]   So let me share with you the portrait of a millionaire
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.480]   so that you can have a picture of who the millionaires are.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.340]   And this comes from page eight of the version
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.620]   that I have of The Millionaire Next Door.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.420]   Who is the prototypical American millionaire?
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.500]   What would he tell you about himself?
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.740]   I am a 57-year-old male married with three children.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.940]   About 70% of us earn 80% or more of our household's income.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.400]   And incidentally, let me go ahead
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.420]   and read the footnote that's attached to this paragraph.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.740]   And he says this in the footnote on why
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.180]   he uses the-- refers to the typical American millionaire
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.100]   as a he.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.700]   He says, "One profile of the typical--
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.500]   our profile of the typical millionaire
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.820]   is based on studies of millionaire households, not
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.960]   individuals.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.020]   It is therefore impossible in most cases
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.140]   to say with certainty whether our typical millionaire
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.860]   is a he or a she.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.140]   Nevertheless, because 95% of millionaire households
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.940]   are composed of married couples, and because in 70%
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.260]   of these cases, the male head of the household
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.900]   contributes at least 80% of the income,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.980]   we will usually refer to the typical American millionaire
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.340]   as he in this book."
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.500]   So hopefully that'll help you if you
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.100]   struggle with the word he/she.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.220]   So I'm a 57-year-old male married with three children.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.260]   Notice the age.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.300]   57-year-old male.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.940]   Notice married with children.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.180]   About 70% of us earn 80% or more of our household's income.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.460]   About one in five of us is retired.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.820]   About 2/3 of us who are working are self-employed.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.100]   Interestingly, self-employed people
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.660]   make up less than 20% of the workers in America,
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.980]   but account for 2/3 of the millionaires.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.300]   Also, three out of four of us who are self-employed
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.780]   consider ourselves to be entrepreneurs.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.220]   Most of the others are self-employed professionals,
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.580]   such as doctors and accountants.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.060]   Do you notice how--
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.940]   and I'm interrupting.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.420]   This is Joshua again, not the book.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.900]   But do you notice how--
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.320]   and if you read this, just listen
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.820]   to how many of the themes that I--
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.320]   I didn't even realize until I went back and listened to this,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.460]   how many of this data that he presents
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.420]   have influenced the themes that I talk about on the show?
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.980]   Why do I talk about entrepreneurship?
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.340]   Well, because three out of four of us who are self--
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.060]   because 2/3 of the millionaires are self-employed.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.500]   And then most of the others are self-employed professionals.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.040]   So entrepreneurship is a major factor in wealth building.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.180]   Continuing here, many of the types of businesses we are in
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.140]   could be classified as dull normal.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.460]   We are welding contractors, auctioneers, rice farmers,
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.180]   owners of mobile home parks, pest controllers, coin
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.420]   and stamp dealers, and paving contractors.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.900]   About half of our wives do not work outside the home.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.700]   The number one occupation for those wives who do work
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.340]   is teacher.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.000]   Our household's total annual realized taxable income
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.580]   is $131,000 median, or 50th percentile,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.980]   while our average income is $247,000.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.100]   Note that those of us who have incomes in the $500,000
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.060]   to $999,999 category, 8%, and the $1 million
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.020]   or more category, 5%, skew the average upward.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.780]   We have an average household net worth of $3.7 million.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.180]   Of course, some of our cohorts have accumulated much more.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.020]   Nearly 6% have a net worth of over $10 million.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.700]   Again, these people skew our average upward.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.020]   The typical median, or 50th percentile,
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.500]   millionaire household has a net worth of $1.6 million.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.860]   On average, our total annual realized income
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.060]   is less than 7% of our wealth.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.820]   In other words, we live on less than 7% of our wealth.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.620]   Most of us, 97%, are homeowners.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.420]   We live in homes currently valued at an average of $320,000.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.980]   About half of us have occupied the same home
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.500]   for more than 20 years.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.540]   Thus, we have enjoyed significant increases
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.860]   in the value of our homes.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.220]   Most of us have never felt at a disadvantage
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.180]   because we did not receive any inheritance.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.260]   About 80% of us are first generation affluent.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   We live well below our means.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.060]   We wear inexpensive suits and drive American-made cars.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   Only a minority of us drive the current model year automobile.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.740]   Only a minority ever lease our motor vehicles.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.860]   Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.420]   In fact, only 18% of us disagreed with the statement,
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.460]   charity begins at home.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.540]   Most of us will tell you that our wives are
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.220]   a lot more conservative with money than we are.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.460]   We have a go-to-hell fund.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.420]   In other words, we have accumulated enough wealth
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.140]   to live without working for 10 or more years.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.460]   Thus, those of us with a net worth of $1.6 million
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.060]   could live comfortably for more than 12 years.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.780]   Actually, we could live longer than that,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.300]   since we save at least 15% of our earned income.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.100]   We have more than 6 and 1/2 times the level of wealth
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.020]   of our non-millionaire neighbors.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.260]   But in our neighborhood, these non-millionaires
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.740]   outnumber us better than 3 to 1.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.140]   Could it be that they have chosen
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.620]   to trade wealth for acquiring high status
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.020]   material possessions?
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.180]   As a group, we are fairly well educated.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.860]   Only about one in five are not college graduates.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.580]   Many of us hold advanced degrees.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.860]   18% have master's degrees, 8% law degrees,
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.780]   6% medical degrees, and 6% PhDs.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.540]   Only 17% of us or our spouses ever
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.220]   attended a private elementary or private high school.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.140]   But 55% of our children are currently attending
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.000]   or have attended private schools.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.940]   As a group, we believe that education
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.020]   is extremely important for ourselves, our children,
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.620]   and our grandchildren.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.820]   We spend heavily for the educations of our offspring.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.620]   About 2/3 of us work between 45 and 55 hours per week.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.460]   We are fastidious investors.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.180]   On average, we invest nearly 20% of our household realized income
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.380]   each year.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.300]   Most of us invest at least 15%.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.500]   79% of us have at least one account
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.180]   with a brokerage company, but we make our own investment
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.860]   decisions.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.720]   We hold nearly 20% of our household's wealth
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.220]   in transaction securities, such as publicly traded stocks
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.860]   and mutual funds, but we rarely sell our equity investments.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.220]   We hold even more in our pension plans.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.660]   On average, 21% of our household's wealth
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.580]   is in our private businesses.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   As a group, we feel that our daughters
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.220]   are financially handicapped in comparison to our sons.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.060]   Men seem to make much more money even
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.580]   within the same occupational categories.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.420]   That is why most of us would not hesitate
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.000]   to share some of our wealth with our daughters.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.280]   Our sons and men in general have the deck of economic cards
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.900]   stacked in their favor.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.980]   They should not need subsidies from their parents.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.660]   What would be the ideal occupations
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.300]   for our sons and daughters?
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.180]   There are about 3.5 millionaire households like ours.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.100]   Our numbers are growing much faster
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.020]   than the general population.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.060]   Our kids should consider providing affluent people
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.620]   with some valuable service.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.220]   Overall, our most trusted financial advisors
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.940]   are our accountants.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.060]   Our attorneys are also very important.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.260]   So we recommend accounting and law to our children.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.420]   Tax advisors and estate planning experts
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.020]   will be in big demand over the next 15 years.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.340]   I am a tightwad.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.180]   That's one of the main reasons I completed a long questionnaire
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.300]   for a crispy $1 bill.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.020]   Why else would I spend two or three hours being personally
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.900]   interviewed by these authors?
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.260]   They paid me $100, $200, or $250.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.620]   So they made me another offer to donate in my name
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.080]   the money I earned for my interview
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.340]   to my favorite charity.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.660]   But I told them, I am my favorite charity.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.420]   I love that statement.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.620]   This book, remember-- well, this one is copyrighted in 1996.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.860]   And this book-- notice the level of data and detail.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.500]   And this was a huge deal for me, because in having the data--
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.100]   and this book is very data intensive.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.460]   You can actually see, look, the numbers don't lie.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.940]   No matter what it looks like in pop culture,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.580]   no matter that it looks like the wealthy are on TV
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.540]   and the way to get rich is to become a movie star,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.740]   that's simply not the case.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.340]   It's better to be an auctioneer or a cattle rancher
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.020]   or the owner of a trucking company.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.460]   And that's what he goes through and talks about.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.260]   This was a huge, huge deal for me to understand.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.100]   He goes on, and right in the beginning, he talks about--
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.380]   and this is the second lesson.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.300]   I learned the difference from Dr. Stanley
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.700]   between wealth and income.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.500]   This is a difference that many people don't seem to conceive of.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.100]   If you listen to people, some people how they talk,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.140]   especially people who don't have a lot of money,
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.420]   one of the things you often hear is them confusing wealth
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.220]   and income.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.820]   In places that I've been where people are paid primarily hourly
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.020]   wages, I've often heard people talking about the raises
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.500]   that they're going to get, the level of the hourly--
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.860]   I made $2 more an hour.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.820]   I'm going to make this much per hour.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.500]   In the poorer segments of society--
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.060]   I don't have data to back this up.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.500]   It's only my anecdotal experience.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.300]   But there seems to be a much greater focus on income
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.100]   than on wealth.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:49.820]   But if you get those things mixed up, you've got a problem.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.940]   And he goes on, and he defines two terms
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.220]   which he refers to frequently in Millionaire Next Door, which
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.220]   he abbreviates UAW and PAW.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.940]   And the UAW is an under accumulator of wealth
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.660]   versus a PAW, which is a prodigious accumulator
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.700]   of wealth.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.420]   What you find is that certainly your income drives your wealth,
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.660]   but it's not so much how much income and much more about what
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.580]   do you actually do with the income.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.820]   Notice that in the data I just read,
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.780]   the median income, which means the 50th percentile of income,
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.060]   is $131,000.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.940]   So of the millionaires, that's the most common number,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.900]   is $131,000.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.980]   That's not that much money comparatively speaking.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.060]   Now this data is 15, 20 years old.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.020]   So there would have to be an adjustment for inflation.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.780]   But that's not really that much money in today's world.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.660]   So the key is to differentiate between wealth and income.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.740]   Another lesson that he gives elsewhere in the book
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.580]   is he talks a lot about how the wealthy are much more
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.660]   likely to realize a very small percentage of their wealth
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.460]   as income than the other way around.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.900]   And that's one of the measurements.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.280]   You mentioned-- you noticed that in the data I just read,
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.380]   he said 7%, that the average millionaire only
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.660]   realizes 7% of their net wealth per year in income.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.860]   And that's partly because they're wealthy,
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.660]   but it's also because their income is low,
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.020]   their expenses are low, and they're
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.900]   keeping their taxable realized income low to avoid the tax.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.020]   Lesson three I learned is that it's OK to simply
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.300]   be on the way to wealth.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.020]   And there's a formula that he gave
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.780]   to determine if you're wealthy, to differentiate
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.660]   between the under accumulators of wealth
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.900]   and the prodigious accumulators of wealth.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.620]   That was his formula that he used.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.100]   And here's the formula of how to determine if you're wealthy.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:48.020]   Multiply your age times your realized pre-tax annual
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.620]   household income from all sources except inheritances.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.660]   Divide by 10.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.420]   This, less any inherited wealth, is
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.780]   what your net worth should be.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.140]   So as long as we're ignoring inheritances--
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.460]   and that's basically the rules, let me give this to you
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.420]   in a less wordy manner.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.480]   Take your age, multiply it times your income,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.700]   and divide it by 10.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.740]   And that should be-- that's what your net worth should be.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.620]   Now the thing I like about that is that formula accounts
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.860]   for age and it accounts for income.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.280]   And those are two things that are important to account for.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.220]   I had this complex when I was younger that I wasn't rich yet.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.900]   After all, I was 23 years old and I should be rich by now.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.780]   The reality is age has a big factor in it.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.580]   I have had people ask me and say, Joshua,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.260]   if you're doing this show on how to get wealthy,
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.800]   how on earth are you doing the show?
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.140]   Do old people want to know how much money you have?
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.780]   If someone asked me, I probably wouldn't tell them.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.900]   But frankly, I'm much more of the conservative perspective
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.180]   than the look at me or how rich I am.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.660]   But for my age, I've done well.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.780]   But I'm not 57 years old, so I'm not a millionaire yet.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.060]   It's unreasonable to expect a 27-year-old to be a millionaire.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.820]   It happens.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.140]   It's unreasonable to expect.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.900]   I think it's reasonable to expect someone
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.720]   who's been paying attention for several decades, a 67-year-old,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.960]   to be a millionaire with the application of principles.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.100]   So if I were 67 years old, I would
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.620]   have very little credibility simply
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.980]   because many years have passed.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.760]   And if I'm still in the financial condition
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.980]   that I'm in today, I'd have very little credibility.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.000]   But 29 years old, when I run that formula, I'm doing OK.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.100]   So it's OK to be simply on the way to wealth.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.300]   And that was encouraging to me when I would sit down
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.900]   and calculate that.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.500]   Now, he goes on and says, "To be well positioned
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   in the prodigious accumulator of wealth category,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.260]   you should be worth twice the level of wealth expected."
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.980]   So that calculation is simply, here's
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.900]   what we expect your wealth to be.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.420]   And you should be worth twice the level of wealth.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.980]   Incidentally, I'm not yet-- well, you know what?
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.740]   Hold on a second.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.940]   OK, I'm not yet in that category, primarily
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.300]   due to career changes.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.180]   But who knows?
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.820]   I'll be there as soon as I can.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.260]   But it's OK to be where you are was the point of the lesson.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.260]   It's OK to be simply on the way to wealth.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.620]   Number four lesson I learned was I
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.860]   learned to be proud of being frugal,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.780]   or at least to be confident in being frugal.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.700]   And frugality is a virtue that doesn't
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.700]   seem to be honored very much in our culture, at least
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.380]   not in mainstream pop culture.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.980]   We often seem to honor extravagance and largesse
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.060]   and hyper-consumption.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.580]   And so if you're a frugal person, it's tough.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:55.860]   You need to have your backbone built up to really, I guess,
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.060]   to be confident in being frugal.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.900]   We're not taught in society to be frugal.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.900]   And as a kid growing up, be careful with your children.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   It's so easy to adopt society's claims
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.420]   for what should be looked like for virtue
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.380]   versus your idea of virtue.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.340]   I remember as a young man, as a teenager,
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.980]   I was critical of my parents.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.260]   Like, why don't you spend some money?
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.700]   Most teenagers probably are.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.140]   They'll probably go through this someday with my son.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.860]   But on page 28 of Millionaire Next Door,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.500]   Stanley says, "What are three words
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.780]   that profile the affluent?
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.420]   Frugal, frugal, frugal."
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.620]   Being frugal is the cornerstone of wealth building.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.740]   And yet even today, it's so funny to me how people--
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.380]   now, I don't have the same insecurities that I once had.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.460]   But people are often like, why are you so frugal?
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.580]   Listen, this stuff matters.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.020]   I got to build wealth.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.620]   If I spend it all, I'm not going to have it.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.340]   And so obviously, there's a level of frugality
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.580]   that is appropriate at a certain scale.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.620]   I'm so glad to hear that evidently Dr. Stanley bought
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.580]   himself a Corvette last year.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.180]   I mean, how great is it?
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.020]   That was probably one of his extravagances
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.140]   that was super fun for him to buy himself
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.580]   a fancy brand new Corvette.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.700]   And I think that's awesome.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.340]   So frugality is not that we never buy anything nice.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.460]   It's that we buy it in a manner that's appropriate
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.780]   with our scale, with where we are.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.900]   And Stanley taught that the foundation stone
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.660]   of wealth accumulation is great defense, frugality.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.580]   The data helped me, especially as a financial advisor.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.300]   Financial advisors are a weird lot.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.180]   It's a weird occupation.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.660]   And as a class, it's very difficult to discern
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.500]   among financial advisors.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.700]   And in many ways, some ways, Stanley
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.100]   doesn't talk that much about the actual financial situation
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.180]   of financial advisors.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.380]   He talks some about doctors.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.740]   I kind of think of it as doctors,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.460]   is that he talks in his work, in his research,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.380]   that it seems like physicians often
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.980]   fall into the very spendy, hyper-consumption category,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.060]   or they often fall into the very frugal, very rich category.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.100]   And so financial advisors, it's similar.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.140]   Many financial advisors are all hat and no cattle,
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.340]   as they say in Texas.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.380]   They're all about flashy lifestyle.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.700]   And if you were actually looking at the balance
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.180]   sheet of some people who market themselves
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.860]   as financial advisors, their personal balance sheet
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.780]   is very, very poor.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.740]   Incidentally, that may or may not be a problem.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.980]   A lot of people would be offended by that.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.860]   If you're hiring somebody for their expertise
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.980]   as, say, a portfolio manager or, say, a tax specialist,
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.740]   something like that, all of those things
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.860]   can be financial advisors.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.540]   How much of their own money they actually spend
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.980]   does not necessarily impact their qualifications
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.580]   to give you specific tax advice.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.420]   I think it's important to note that, simply that just
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.980]   because somebody enjoys consuming all their money
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.220]   and doesn't prefer to build wealth
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.700]   doesn't invalidate their investment predictions.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.500]   Doesn't necessarily invalidate their tax advice.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.460]   But in general, I think most people
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.140]   would want their financial advisor to be wealthy.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:16.180]   So there's this idea of expressing a certain image.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.700]   There's a perception bias.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.780]   And as an advisor, you need to be aware of that,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.900]   because the way that people perceive you is the way
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.460]   that you are in their mind.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.060]   And so that's why your financial advisor probably
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.980]   shouldn't drive a too broken down car,
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.060]   because you need to create this perception that you
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.220]   are moderately successful.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.340]   People generally are attracted to success.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.980]   That's why you probably shouldn't be a fat slob
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.220]   with donut crumbs in your beard.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.140]   You probably should dress in a certain way.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.180]   And so there's these rules that go on.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.380]   So some financial advisors are all hat and no cattle.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.020]   They look like they're doing well.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.780]   And they're earning a lot, but they're spending a lot.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.220]   But then some advisors really are really wealthy.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.540]   And they serve people well.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.900]   And you don't know.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.620]   That's the thing.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.460]   You don't know.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.180]   You don't have any idea.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.860]   When you're where I live in South Florida,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.380]   there's a Mercedes in every traffic light.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.380]   You don't have any idea, is this person
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.300]   someone who's trying to imitate the rich?
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.100]   Or is this someone who's really just rich,
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.220]   and it doesn't even matter?
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.860]   And they're just driving a nice car.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.580]   So it's a high pressure industry, though,
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.100]   where you're pressured to look a certain way.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.020]   And Stanley gave me a little bit of confidence,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.500]   that no, I need to be frugal.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.220]   And I just simply told my clients, listen,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.220]   if you want me to be a high-consuming advisor,
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.620]   you need to find somebody else.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.380]   But if you want somebody who actually is rich for their age,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.340]   then--
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.500]   and wants to actually teach you how to get rich--
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.940]   I can't teach you how to spend a lot of money.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.620]   I can teach you how to get rich.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.820]   Then that would be one factor.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.460]   And so that was a valuable lesson.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.180]   The fifth lesson that I wrote down today
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.380]   is from Stanley's work, is I learned to choose my spouse
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.940]   very carefully.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.580]   And this was a big deal to me, not
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:01.180]   in the sense of a scheming way of my spouse
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.020]   has to only spend this certain amount of money.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.660]   But one of the most important decisions
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.180]   that you make in life that will dictate just
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.500]   about everything else in life is who your spouse is.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.660]   It's a huge decision, huge decision,
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.540]   in just about every single way.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.140]   So whether that's from the perspective
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.740]   of the amount of money they spend,
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.460]   or whether it's from the perspective of just who they
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.780]   are and their character, what they're committed to,
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.860]   the type of lifestyle that they want.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.460]   If I want a backpack around the world
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.060]   and my spouse wants a fancy condo on Palm Beach,
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.860]   we're going to have a bit of a disagreement.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.900]   And this is one of the things that--
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.700]   one of many factors that causes marriages to fall apart.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.500]   Partnerships where the partners are incompatible generally
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.140]   don't turn out well over the long term.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.380]   And careful selection of a spouse is extremely important.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.260]   And it is definitely a major factor in wealth building.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.380]   Stanley profiled the research of--
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.140]   and again, to the data of how important your spouse is
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.300]   to a wealth building plan.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.060]   And as I read in the beginning, about half
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.580]   of the spouses of the wealthy are stay-at-home moms.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:14.180]   And he says on page 36, he says flat out,
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.940]   he says if your spouse isn't frugal,
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.860]   you're going to have a very hard time building wealth.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.380]   A couple cannot accumulate wealth if one of its members
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.860]   is a hyper-consumer.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.340]   And I think this is a big deal in our society
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.460]   as far as household structure and how to handle it.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.980]   Now, it's politically incorrect in our society
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.820]   to have any discussion of gender roles,
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.540]   especially if gender roles are distinct in any way.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.300]   It's extremely politically incorrect.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.220]   And we're all supposed to say, well, we're all the same.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.420]   We have exactly the same role.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.020]   Sorry, I don't buy it.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.620]   I think that's actually one of the major factors that
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:53.380]   keeps households poor is because there's no gender distinction.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.500]   And so from an economic perspective,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.420]   this doesn't take advantage of-- because there's
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.340]   no gender distinction.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.540]   We're both supposed to do the same thing.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.240]   We're supposed to be equal.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.860]   And it's supposed to be this perfect thing where we both
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.540]   have exactly the same roles, which
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.220]   is what society, the politically correct role the society
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.220]   works to advance.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.180]   This doesn't take advantage of any
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.380]   of the efficiencies of the division of labor.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.780]   The fundamental economic principle
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.860]   is that in a high division of labor economy,
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.020]   you're going to have much greater wealth
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.980]   than in a low division of labor economy.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.240]   The same thing in a household.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.620]   In a household with a high division of labor,
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.860]   it's much more efficient than an inefficient household.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.220]   And so that-- now, who knows if this research was in 1996.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.060]   I don't know what the updated statistics are.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.460]   Maybe they've changed in the last 20 years.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.340]   But it just has much to do with running a household efficiently.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.660]   And if both spouses are doing exactly the same thing,
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.300]   it's by definition inefficient.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.940]   So for me, I chose my wife very carefully.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.980]   I didn't want to compete with my spouse.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.220]   I wanted a frugal spouse to complement me and to help me
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.920]   in our joint journey together.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.900]   And this was a big deal.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.420]   A simple example is just for me personally, again,
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.020]   I don't care what you or anyone does with their life.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.340]   You run your life how you want.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.740]   But one of the things that was important to me
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.140]   is I avoided many people who were
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.540]   very focused on their career.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.540]   That was not-- I'm not saying I wasn't some Casanova who
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.920]   could have any woman in the world.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.300]   Of course, that would play a role.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.060]   But I didn't want to compete.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.220]   I didn't want to be married.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.180]   There was a girl at one point that I
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.220]   was interested in that was going to be a physician.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.180]   I didn't want to be married to a physician.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.740]   Nothing wrong with being a physician,
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.220]   but that wasn't the lifestyle that I wanted.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.180]   And so I chose differently.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.260]   And so one of the things that you see in his research
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.860]   here was choose your spouse carefully
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.460]   and make sure that they complement you
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.980]   and that they'll be an asset to you.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.620]   And this goes both ways.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.740]   Choose your spouse carefully.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.460]   Now, each couple has to work this out in a way that
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.780]   is effective for them.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.180]   And that's where I don't think you can legislate certain
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.380]   things, say this is the way it is.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.780]   But two frugal people working together and taking
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:08.940]   advantages of the efficiencies of a division of labor
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.220]   within their relationship and taking advantage
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.300]   of complementing one another and having complementary skill
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.260]   sets instead of competitive skill sets,
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   this idea that many couples seem to have--
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.620]   many of my friends that we have to compete with each other.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.460]   I'll put as far as at least with a nice easily measured
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.460]   metric of wealth accumulation, I'll
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.740]   put them up against each other.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.300]   And I think the spouses that work together
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.100]   towards common goals will win every time.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.060]   One of the things that quote here in this section
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.340]   says a self-made millionaire stated it best when he told us,
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.100]   I can't get my wife to spend any money.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.860]   And I'm proud to say I feel the same way about my wife.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.060]   She is an amazing woman, but I can't get her to spend
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.580]   any money.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.700]   I try and try and try.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.540]   She's more frugal than I am.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:06.020]   And so that builds instead of this antagonistic relationship
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.860]   where the woman earns all the money and the man spends it all
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.320]   or the man earns all the money and the woman spends it all,
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.020]   instead of this antagonistic relationship,
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.620]   it becomes a joy where then I look at it and I say,
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.260]   how can I do nice things for my wife?
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.960]   And how can I spend money on her in a way
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.180]   that will bring her pleasure?
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.660]   So this is a big deal, and people
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.740]   don't often talk about it.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.860]   When's the last time--
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.260]   it's like I would put a higher degree on the value of a college
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.660]   education if after working as a financial planner knowing
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.380]   that these kinds of conflicts are what destroy financial lives
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.940]   and what destroy marriages and destroy families.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.400]   And when your marriage is destroyed
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   and your family is destroyed, now your career
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.580]   is destroyed for some people.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.160]   And now when your career is destroyed,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.780]   your whole financial plan is destroyed,
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.200]   knowing the actual real world effect of this,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.460]   I would think this would be something that we would be
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.620]   talking about in a high school classroom.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.140]   Might be important to understand how to effectively choose
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.780]   your spouse.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.180]   Now, it is the parents' job to teach children
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.100]   those considerations.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.380]   So I don't lay the blame at--
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.140]   I lay the blame at us as parents.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.060]   This is our job.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.060]   But this is the kind of stuff that really impacts life,
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.500]   not necessarily what all of the schooling is about.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.020]   Stanley says it very straightforward.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   He says, "Most people will never become
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.540]   wealthy in one generation if they are married
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.140]   to people who are wasteful."
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.700]   Big deal.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.060]   So that was the fifth lesson.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.060]   I learned to choose my spouse very carefully.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.180]   And I'm thankful to my parents that they taught me
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.500]   that at an early age as well.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.060]   Number six, Dr. Stanley taught me not to go with the crowd.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.220]   Example from my perspective here of how
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.260]   I'm relating this lesson is oftentimes financial advisors
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.860]   who are new in the business.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.720]   I always feel bad.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.620]   Those of you who are attorneys and who are physicians who
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.180]   are listening, I'm sorry.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.520]   But it seems like the first people that financial advisors
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.060]   target if they don't have any natural network or any marketing
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.540]   plan is they start calling attorneys and doctors.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.100]   And it's tough.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.540]   I had several clients who were attorneys,
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.900]   several clients who were doctors.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.900]   And you guys get targeted all the time.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.540]   And I'm sorry.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.060]   It's just big income, self-employed professional,
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.320]   usually big spenders, oftentimes big spenders.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.220]   And so we're able to, hey, this would be a great fit.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.260]   But what I learned was not to go with the crowd.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.540]   And for me personally, I didn't enjoy
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.060]   working with the majority of people
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.180]   involved in those professions.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.480]   It's not that I didn't have any problem with it.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.220]   Some individuals.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.420]   It's just that I didn't fit very well with the majority of people
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.980]   in those professions.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.620]   I didn't play the same lifestyle necessarily.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.380]   I did have-- again, I had some clients who
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.620]   I was a great personality fit.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.260]   But these people were also atypical
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.580]   within their profession.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.060]   And it's always hard to generalize.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   But what Dr. Stanley taught me was
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.500]   that I should look for auctioneers
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.420]   and owners of plumbing businesses and farmers
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.620]   and scrap metal dealers and things like that.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.780]   And I found that I actually get along far better
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.660]   with those people in general.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.740]   If I were to take a proportion of farmers
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.940]   versus a percentage of attorneys,
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.620]   I'll have a better personality fit with all the farmers
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.780]   than with all the attorneys.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.420]   So when I took that personality fit
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.540]   and I compared it to Stanley's research
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.340]   into where the wealth is, I was able to find people
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.780]   that I really enjoyed working with.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.620]   I was able to find--
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.860]   I would much rather be doing business
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.060]   around the back of a pickup truck
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   than at the top of some high rise.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.900]   Not that I can't go in and be effective in the high rise.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   It was just, OK, fine.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.820]   And I'll work on here.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.900]   I liked working in little industrial parks.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.940]   And I'd find all kinds of blue collar business owners.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.060]   Some guy has a hurricane shutter company
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.460]   and makes a million bucks a year.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.460]   And I found another guy.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.100]   OK, this guy has a plumbing company
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.340]   and is running this plumbing company.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.740]   You wouldn't really know it was that big unless you knew.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.940]   But you found out it was incredibly profitable.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.540]   And this guy here is a drywall company.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.460]   And this person has an insulation company.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.020]   And all of a sudden, I started to find
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.300]   I can build a client base with these entrepreneurs
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.900]   that I really like working with who
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.460]   don't look at what society says is wealthy,
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.180]   but actually are extremely wealthy.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.100]   It was a big deal to me to learn that.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.540]   Very, very useful.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.500]   The data that he provided gave me the courage and confidence
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.980]   to not go with the crowd and just to recognize that I
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.220]   needed to find my own niche that would work effectively with me.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.940]   Number seven, Dr. Stanley taught me to choose my housing
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.180]   very, very carefully.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.940]   If you read any of his work, you will
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.660]   be forced to come away with the fact
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.420]   that housing is a major decision with regard
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.580]   to the productivity of being able to build wealth.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.020]   It drives everything else.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.260]   And he's very clear that half the affluent millionaires
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:53.420]   in America do not live in high status neighborhoods.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.060]   Now, that means half of them do, but half of them don't.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.540]   And I'll cover that half and half concept in lesson number
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.020]   10.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.280]   But what this means is that your house actually
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.060]   drives many of your expenses.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.540]   A, it's a big expense.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.500]   And comparatively speaking, the size
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.380]   or the cost of your house, I mean,
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.980]   that's just going to be a big expense.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.220]   Most people, their biggest expense in their life is taxes.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.320]   Number two is housing.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.620]   So when you actually sit down and run an income statement
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.980]   and figure out an income and expense statement and say,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.540]   where are the expenses going, you'll
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.340]   find that for the majority of people,
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.620]   the largest category is tax.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.900]   The second largest category is housing.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.420]   Well, we can make a big difference in overall expenses
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.900]   if we can tackle the big categories.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.640]   It's a fundamental rule.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.440]   Focus with the 80/20 analysis.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.260]   Focus on the 20% of categories that
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.460]   are going to give you 80% of your results.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.600]   One is tax.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.260]   Two is housing.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.600]   Three is usually transportation.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.080]   Most people have a lot of cars.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.280]   And then it breaks down from there.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.200]   So just the choice right off the bat of how big your house is
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.680]   and how big the mortgage payment is
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.820]   or how much money you spend on it is a big deal.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.540]   Plus, that house, the actual value of the house,
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.280]   is all consumption.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.700]   It may or may not work out fine.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.200]   It may or may not appreciate in the long run.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.400]   But it is consumption.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.040]   It's not investment.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.200]   So if you simply make the choice to not buy a $400,000 house
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.720]   but to buy a $300,000 house, then by definition,
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.360]   you are not consuming $100,000 worth of money.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.520]   And you're able to invest it.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.360]   That's going to make a substantial difference
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.320]   over time.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.840]   And then housing drives every other decision in life,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.540]   is what he's clear with his research.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.840]   If you live in a high-status neighborhood
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.480]   and you want to drive kind of a broken-down six-year-old pickup
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.360]   truck, you're probably not going to feel so comfortable.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.480]   So people who live in high-status neighborhoods,
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.600]   in order to feel comfortable, are
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   going to need to upgrade their cars more frequently.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.640]   They're going to need to keep their house in maybe
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.400]   more fancy-looking shape.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.760]   So then it's going to be higher maintenance costs.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.480]   Perhaps you could paint every 10 years,
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.060]   but you need to paint every six years,
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.200]   because that's what this neighborhood requires.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.480]   You're going to need to keep your lawn in fancier condition.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.440]   It's just everything is associated with it.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.000]   So the choice of what type of neighborhood to live in
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.600]   is going to drive every other expense.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.360]   Now, of course, there's the corollary of,
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.780]   well, if you get in a neighborhood
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.800]   that you don't want to be in, then what's
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.180]   the point of having money at all?
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.720]   So there is a natural choice.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   But there's going to be a comfort level.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.360]   You don't necessarily want to be at the lowest cost.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.920]   That might not be comfortable for you.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.440]   That might violate just a standard of living.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.140]   It might violate safety for your family
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.200]   or the type of lifestyle that you want to be exposed to.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.760]   But if you just make the choice to live in less house
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.040]   than you afford, than you could spend,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.460]   it'll affect every other area of your life.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.920]   It's much easier to accumulate wealth
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.160]   if you don't live in a high-status neighborhood.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.280]   So as an example of how I applied this in my life,
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.600]   when my wife and I were shopping,
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.720]   we originally were shopping.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.920]   I wanted to spend about $100,000 on a house,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.120]   if I could find one.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.360]   And the goal of spending the $100,000 on the house
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.960]   was I wanted to keep as much capital
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.080]   available for investment as possible.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.040]   And the goal was, let's do a starter home idea.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.800]   And let's spend $100,000 on a house.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.500]   Let's plan to live there for four or five years.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.960]   We'll probably outgrow the house.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.280]   And then we'll have a good rental property
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.680]   to move out of while we're building up other investment
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.160]   assets.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.800]   That was the original plan.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.760]   We couldn't find something that was suitable to the lifestyle
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.040]   that we wanted to live in that price range in Palm Beach
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.000]   County, where I live, especially that was close enough
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.680]   to my office to outweigh that.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.480]   So the compromise that we made was
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.320]   we upgraded the cost of this community, the neighborhood
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.120]   that we were searching for.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:52.040]   And I said, if we can be in close proximity to my office,
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.560]   then we can spend more money.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.840]   And so by being in close proximity to my office,
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.640]   instead of buying cheaper farther away,
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.520]   we bought more expensive closer.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.000]   That allowed us to get rid of a second car, which pulled out
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.840]   a whole set of expenses.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.620]   It also allowed me to trade non-deductible expenses
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:11.760]   of commuting costs with ongoing non-deductible costs
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.960]   for a deductible mortgage interest cost.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.600]   And it also allowed me to trade all of the focus
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   on all those miles on a car for depreciating cost, which
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.800]   is going to be constant expense, versus having
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.840]   an extra $100,000 of value locked up in a house, which,
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.400]   yes, it is a consumption.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.960]   But at least it has the potential to appreciate.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.120]   And probably, with the area that we live in,
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.720]   we're at an above average, long-term above average,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.600]   above the average rate of inflation in my area.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.320]   But in choosing, it was very important to us
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.000]   that we didn't buy in one of the fancy neighborhoods.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.960]   So the neighborhood we live in is kind of right
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.200]   on this interesting cusp.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.160]   It's not quite blue-collar working class,
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.000]   but it's also not quite fancy.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.200]   It's not quite super posh.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.640]   It's in a great location, but it's
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.280]   kind of an old-fashioned neighborhood.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.000]   It's kind of a normal neighborhood.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.600]   Old-fashioned.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.900]   We don't find-- most of the neighborhoods where I live
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.920]   are just large, gated communities, golf communities,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.280]   things like that.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.860]   So one of the key things, though, is we said, OK,
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.920]   instead of doing the starter home plan,
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.120]   we'll just buy a house that can hopefully fit us
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.240]   for a very long period of time.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.360]   And so it should be big enough to handle a family,
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.120]   to not have to outgrow, but not too big.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.600]   I want a bunch of extra rooms.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.120]   So it feels pretty big, but it's not too big,
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.400]   comparatively speaking.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.480]   And it's nice enough to not feel like you've got to move,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.440]   but it's not so nice you've got to upkeep it.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.320]   And I'll give you an example.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.480]   One of the things that was important to me
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.080]   in choosing a neighborhood, I wanted a neighborhood
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.720]   where I didn't feel like I had to mow my lawn every week.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.160]   And so thankfully, this neighborhood
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.080]   is kind of an interesting mix of some--
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.840]   houses are very fancily landscaped,
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.080]   and some houses are not.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.760]   But I don't feel like I have to drive a fancy car.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.120]   I don't feel like I have to-- this social pressure
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.520]   of upgrading the car every few years, those types of things.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.040]   And so it's worked out well.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.000]   Now interestingly, in hindsight, would we
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.520]   buy the same house if I didn't have
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.880]   that same geographic limitation?
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.920]   No, because now that I don't have that office location,
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.720]   I never anticipated that I wouldn't
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.280]   have that office location.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.480]   Then now I could live in another part of town
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.640]   and get the same for cheaper, maybe.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.320]   But it's fine.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.400]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.800]   And it's a great location.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.560]   And it's the kind of house that who knows,
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.320]   we may stay here for the rest of our lives.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.280]   It certainly has that capacity.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.640]   But just simply that simple choice of housing
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.160]   and where you buy and when you buy and all that stuff
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.440]   can make a massive long-term difference.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.400]   Very careful.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.240]   He does give one interesting rule,
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.960]   which I'll share with you.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.920]   It's from page 68.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:51.000]   He says, "If you're not yet wealthy, but want to be someday,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.280]   never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.920]   is more than twice your household's total annual
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.960]   realized income."
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.000]   So never take out a mortgage that's
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.520]   higher in amount than twice your household's annual realized
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.280]   income, annual income.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.240]   And thankfully, we followed that rule pretty close.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.640]   It was just about right.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.120]   So over time, it should be fine.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.640]   So it was a valuable lesson, very valuable lesson.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   And again, these examples, when have you
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.840]   taken the time to sit down with somebody and say,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.320]   let me teach you how to make a very careful housing decision.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.360]   Because this one decision, which is a massive decision
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.240]   and is so easy to get caught up in the joy and the thrill
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:37.400]   and the emotion of spending big money, be careful.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.640]   And let me give you some ideas.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.080]   Number eight, Dr. Stanley taught me
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.680]   that you aren't what you drive.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.560]   He makes a big point.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.020]   I'm not going to belabor the point,
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.720]   but he makes a big point of profiling carefully
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   the makes and models of cars that millionaires drive.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.760]   And what you find, the largest brand, at least back then,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.560]   that people drive was 9.4% of millionaires drive Fords.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.680]   And this can make a massive impact on your life.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.360]   We know that well.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.440]   It's been beat to death since then.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.020]   But he does a good job with the data
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.860]   and actually illustrating that.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.360]   Number nine is Dr. Stanley taught me the term
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.760]   economic outpatient care.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.720]   And economic outpatient care is a beautiful term,
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.080]   which basically refers to how much money do
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.760]   you have to send your kids after they're
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.480]   supposed to be independent and on their own?
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.920]   And then the next question is, how
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.560]   do you prepare your children so that they're not
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.640]   dependent on you sending them money
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.040]   after they're launched into the world on their own?
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.280]   And this is going to be a massive function in my life
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.000]   over the next two decades with raising our children.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.840]   I need to equip my children to be independent.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.520]   I don't want my children to know that we're wealthy.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.680]   That's another careful thing about the house
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.760]   and the neighborhood that you live in.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.600]   You've got to be careful.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.040]   It's better if your children don't
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.400]   know that you're wealthy.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.040]   He actually gives 10 fantastic rules
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.280]   for affluent parents and productive children,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.800]   how to train your children to be productive.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.760]   I'll read them to you.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.920]   They're from page 203.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.520]   I won't elaborate them.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.040]   But number one, here are the rules.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.440]   Number one, never tell children that their parents are wealthy.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:17.000]   Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   Most people who are--
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.400]   many people of children of parents who are wealthy,
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.440]   they just wake up and they're like, wait a second.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.840]   I didn't know their mom and dad were so rich.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.600]   Number two, no matter how wealthy you are,
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.400]   teach your children discipline and frugality.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.760]   Teach them that.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.280]   And equip them with that character trait.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.040]   Equip them with that virtue and make sure
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.600]   that it's drilled into them.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.200]   Number three, assure that your children won't realize
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.640]   you're affluent until after they have established
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:51.080]   a mature, disciplined, and adult lifestyle and profession.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.720]   Make sure that they're established
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.600]   before they know you're affluent.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.000]   Number four, minimize discussions of the items
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.560]   that each child and grandchildren will inherit
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.320]   or receive as gifts.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.880]   Don't focus on that.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.120]   Number five, never give cash or other significant gifts
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.480]   to your adult children as part of a negotiation strategy.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.680]   I hate this.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.360]   I hate it when people use money as a leverage tool,
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.400]   as a negotiating tool.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.360]   In my mind, it can certainly be immoral.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.520]   Don't give it as a negotiating strategy.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.560]   Number six, stay out of your adult children's family
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.760]   member-- matters.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.560]   Excuse me, matters.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.200]   Stay out of your adult children's family matters.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.400]   Number seven, don't try to compete with your children.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.120]   Don't boast about how much money you have.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.760]   And it sends a confusing message if you tell your kids,
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.640]   well, I was your age.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.440]   I had this much money.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.760]   Number eight, always remember that your children
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.040]   are individuals.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.240]   They're different.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.840]   There are going to be inequalities among your children.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.400]   Nine, emphasize your children's achievements,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:58.440]   no matter how small, not their or your symbols of success.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:05.080]   Focus on what people achieve, not what they have.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.200]   Focus on what you achieve.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.640]   Number 10, tell children that there
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   are a lot of things more valuable than money--
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.520]   good health, longevity, happiness, a loving family,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.640]   self-reliance, fine friends.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.320]   If you have five of these, you're a rich man--
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.080]   reputation, respect, integrity, honesty,
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.240]   and a history of achievements.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   Money is icing on the cake of life.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.840]   You don't ever have to cheat or steal.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.600]   You don't have to break the law or cheat on your taxes.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.280]   It's easier to make money honestly than dishonestly
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.400]   in this country.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.080]   You'll never exist in business if you rip people off.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.720]   Life is the long run.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.080]   You can't hide from adversity.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.160]   You can't hide your children from life's ups and downs.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.280]   The ones who achieve do so by experiencing and conquering
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.800]   obstacles, even from their childhood days.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.520]   These are the ones who were never
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.360]   denied their right to face some struggle, some adversity.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.240]   Others were, in reality, cheated.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.400]   Those who attempted to shelter their children
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.040]   from every conceivable germ in our society
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.560]   never really inoculated them from fear, worry,
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.840]   and the feeling of dependency.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.520]   Not at all.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.020]   There are many other things, but I'm
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.280]   going to close with number 10.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:21.800]   And Dr. Thomas Stanley taught me principles and not rules.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.680]   As an example, when you consume the millionaire next door,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.520]   you might get the idea that everything
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.520]   is about not buying fancy houses and not buying cars.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.640]   But he's very fair in the millionaire next door.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.520]   But if you consume the millionaire next door
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.120]   in the millionaire mind and stop acting rich, all of a sudden,
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.240]   you find out that he does profile
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.960]   these different levels of wealth.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.800]   Probably the most best example of this
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.600]   is in his book, Stop Acting Rich.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.280]   He profiles a segment of society called the glittering rich.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.320]   And the glittering rich are, in essence, as my memory serves,
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.920]   they are a group of society where
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.680]   they have so much money that they can't possibly
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.440]   spend it all.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.920]   And to go out and buy a brand new fancy $150,000 Mercedes
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.040]   is the equivalent to them of maybe a median income
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.400]   earner going and buying a Happy Meal.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.680]   And it's hard for people to process that difference
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.560]   in amount of money.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.000]   But realistically, if you have $100 million,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.200]   it's going to be challenging that your kids are not
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.240]   going to have at least the impression
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.320]   you have $100 million, that you have at least some money.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.320]   Now, you might lead them to believe,
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.240]   and they might come to believe over time
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.560]   that you have $20 million.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.880]   But it's going to be a big difference versus somebody
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.440]   who has $1.2 million.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.200]   That's not the point.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.600]   So Stanley focuses on the principles, not necessarily
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.640]   the rules.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.520]   So many people get bogged down, and I did for a time,
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.840]   and get bogged down in the rule.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.320]   For example, we don't buy new cars.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.240]   Never buy a new car.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.860]   Well, the question is, is it that we never buy a new car,
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.120]   or is it that rather we make intelligent decisions
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.800]   we're frugal with our money, and we make careful buying
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.280]   decisions, always choosing what's
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.920]   best for us at the moment?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.200]   Those are two different things.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.360]   Now, the data shows that many millionaires
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.920]   don't buy new cars, but it also shows that many millionaires
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.880]   do buy new cars.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.600]   The data shows that most millionaires
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.100]   don't lease their cars, but the data
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.160]   shows that some millionaires do lease their cars.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.840]   So if you just simply preach rules
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.480]   that never buy a new car, never lease a car,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.480]   then in a situation where maybe buying a new car
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.760]   is a better decision, you're not going to be thinking that way.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.600]   The only reason why many millionaires in the United
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.780]   States of America don't buy new cars
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.560]   is simply because we have a very efficient market where
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.200]   there's lots of high-quality used vehicles available,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.820]   and there's a substantial discount
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.840]   from the new price versus the used price.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.560]   And so you can get a good buy on a great quality product.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.920]   But that's not the same as if, for example, there
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.520]   were very low inventory, or if the quality of the used car
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.000]   were very low, or if the price difference between a new car
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.840]   and a used car were negligible.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.240]   If you could buy a four-year-old used car for $29,000,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.960]   and you could buy a brand new car for $30,000,
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.000]   it'd be crazy to not buy the new car.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   But that's not the market we live in.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.920]   So what happens is people often memorize a system of rules,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.440]   and they don't understand the underlying principles
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.600]   about the efficiency of a market and the availability of a market
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.280]   and what's available.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.200]   And then they just say, buy a rule.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.840]   And so instead of grasping the principle of frugality
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.800]   in every decision--
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.520]   let's say you're teaching your children.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.560]   If you don't teach your children the principle of frugality
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.320]   and making careful buying decisions,
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.640]   then they may never indeed buy a new car.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.120]   But they might get ripped off on the used car,
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.280]   and they may spend all of their money buying new TVs,
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.680]   new gaming systems, new cell phones, and new clothes.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.560]   Meanwhile, they're feeling good and virtuous about the idea
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.320]   that they never bought a new car, because that was what mom and dad
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.840]   said I never did do.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.640]   So the key is teach the principle of frugality.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.520]   And it may be a better decision for a brand new entrant
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.920]   into the workforce to say--
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.440]   who understands frugality-- to go out and survey the market.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.640]   For example, a couple of years ago,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.360]   after the Cash for Clunkers program
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.720]   took out a bunch of the inventory in the used car market
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.280]   in the United States of America, it
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.360]   was tough to find a used car at a certain price range.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.360]   So the prices dramatically increased.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.160]   And in some cases, you might find an oversupply
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.000]   of new cars of a certain model.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.520]   And there may be many benefits to go out and buy a new car.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.160]   So I could make a case where a certain young person could
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.840]   go out, and they're well served by buying a brand new, say,
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.800]   a Ford or a Honda Civic, a very practical car that can
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.960]   be had for many, many years.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.400]   And the long-term value--
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.980]   the long-term cost is going to be low,
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.720]   because it's a high residual value.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.080]   The car can be run for many years,
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.220]   and there are advantages to buying it new.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.120]   And there's not that much of a discount for buying it and used.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.800]   That person could buy that new car,
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.480]   and that can be a very sound decision,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.800]   because it's a frugal decision, coupled
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.720]   with frugality in other areas of their life.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.400]   So the point is, Dr. Stanley does a good job in his books
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.880]   of talking about principles.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.400]   He explains in one of his books--
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.800]   he gives the anecdote of when he went out and bought
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.920]   a brand new Toyota 4Runner, because his previous Toyota
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.400]   4Runner was low on miles--
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.840]   excuse me, was getting old.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   And I think he gave it to his son,
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.240]   and he needed to go buy a new car.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.720]   But he explains how, even though he bought a brand new Toyota
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.160]   4Runner, he bought a brand new Toyota 4Runner.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.540]   He talks about why and how he made the choice
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.160]   to buy a Toyota 4Runner and not a Lexus GX470.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.660]   He wants the six-cylinder engine instead of the eight-cylinder
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:51.880]   engine.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.200]   It's a lower curb weight, so therefore more fuel efficient,
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.040]   much cheaper price.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.480]   He didn't value the other benefits.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.720]   It would have hurt his lifestyle and things like that.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.360]   So the point is frugality, not rules.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.400]   Principles, not rules.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.440]   Principles, not rules.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.360]   He did a great job of teaching me that lesson.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.900]   I think that's a lesson that we would
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.240]   be well-served to understand.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:20.340]   Understand the principles behind why we do certain things
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.700]   and teach those.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.900]   Because then we can create thinking human beings who
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.100]   can understand their own situation
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.180]   and can rationally look through and think
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:34.820]   through what's right for them and understand.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.100]   That's what I put down for you.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.260]   That's my tribute to Dr. Stanley.
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.940]   I'm sad that he's gone.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.660]   And I wish his family well.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.580]   I think from the cursory news articles that I saw published,
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.000]   his daughter said that she was going to continue his works.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.500]   And I hope she does.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.220]   I hope she does.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.720]   That would be fantastic for someone
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.940]   to continue and build on the body of research.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.840]   And so I recommend to you, if you haven't read his books,
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.640]   check them all out.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.360]   Every one that I've read has been really great.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:07.160]   And I'm sure that you can learn a large number of lessons
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.280]   from that.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.760]   And I think his funeral is on Thursday, if I saw.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.560]   And I wonder if he published-- maybe he
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.800]   had a manuscript or something.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.680]   And we can get one more book from him posthumously.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.760]   That'd be great.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.040]   So I hope you enjoyed and benefited from this content.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.760]   I may do some more shows in coming days with-- again,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.880]   it's always-- I could pick up any one of his chapters
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.800]   from his book and create a lesson on it,
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   just from having read it before, and just teach it through.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.920]   And I think he's probably had more impact on me
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.200]   than many personal finance authors,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.440]   and probably many more people.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.480]   So I wanted to create this tribute show to him.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.820]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.040]   If you have benefited from this, consider
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.480]   checking out the Patreon page.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.880]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   I'm working hard to share additional content as an example.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.640]   Just recently shared the new website with the patrons.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.560]   I'm in the process of designing a new website.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.120]   Hopefully it'll be launched as soon as possible,
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.000]   targeting two or three weeks.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.720]   But that website, it was just the very first draft of it.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.480]   But I released it to the patrons and allowed
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.200]   them to get to see.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.720]   And that's just one of many benefits
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.480]   that I've set up for you guys.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.280]   Just last week, we did the first Q&A call,
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.400]   which was really fun, doing the first Q&A call this week
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.160]   with the mastermind group at the $200 a month level.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.320]   So go by the Patreon page.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.280]   Check out all the benefits that I have for you.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:33.360]   Benefits as little as $1 a month, $3 a month, et cetera.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.760]   We're doing well at growing.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.560]   If we get to $6,000 a month is the goal.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.920]   We're trying to get to $2,000 is the first thing.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.560]   And at $2,000, I'm going to replace the intro music.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.440]   And the goal is to get $6,000 by June 1.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.320]   So I'd appreciate very much your help.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.000]   Thank you for listening.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.120]   Be back with you tomorrow.
