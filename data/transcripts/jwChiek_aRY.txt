[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.920]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.660]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.580]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.720]   how to change your nervous system for the better.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320]   As you recall, your nervous system includes your brain
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.000]   and your spinal cord,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.720]   but also all the connections
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   that your brain and spinal cord make
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240]   with the organs of your body,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.080]   and all the connections that the organs of your body
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.280]   make with your brain and spinal cord.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920]   Now, this thing that we call the nervous system
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.560]   is responsible for everything we know,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.120]   all our behavior, all our emotions,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.820]   everything we feel about ourselves and the outside world,
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.060]   everything we think and believe,
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.440]   it's really at the center of our entire experience
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.180]   of life and who we are.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.160]   Fortunately, in humans, unlike in other species,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.240]   we can change our nervous system
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.840]   by taking some very specific and deliberate actions.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.880]   And today, we're really going to focus on the actions,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.880]   the motor commands and the aspects of movement and balance
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.580]   that allow us to change our nervous system.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.000]   It turns out that movement and balance
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.880]   actually provide windows or portals into our ability
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.360]   to change our nervous system the way we want,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.340]   even if those changes are not about learning new movements
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.800]   or learning how to balance, and soon you'll understand why.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.020]   So let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.200]   that are available to us,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.280]   because those will point directly
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600]   towards the type of protocols that we should engage in
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.720]   to change ourselves for the better.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.120]   There is something called representational plasticity.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.160]   Representational plasticity is just your internal
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.680]   representation of the outside world.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.520]   We know that, for instance, if I want to reach out
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.640]   and grab the pen in front of me,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920]   that I need to generate a certain amount of force,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.220]   so I rarely overshoot, I rarely miss the pen, okay?
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.940]   So our maps of the motor world
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.900]   and our maps of the sensory world are merged.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.900]   The way to create plasticity is to create mismatches
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.740]   or errors in how we perform things.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700]   And this, I think, is an amazing and important feature
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.900]   The way to create plasticity is to send signals
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.060]   to the brain that something is wrong,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.500]   something is different, and something isn't being achieved.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.100]   Errors, and making errors out of sync
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.540]   with what we would like to do is how our nervous system
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.720]   is cued through very distinct biological mechanisms
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.220]   that something isn't going right,
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.420]   and therefore certain neurochemicals are deployed
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.320]   that'll signal the neural circuits that they have to change.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.180]   So let's talk about errors and making errors,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.340]   and why and how that triggers the release of chemicals
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520]   that then allow us to not just learn the thing
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.420]   that we're doing in the motor sense,
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540]   play the piano, dance, et cetera,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.580]   but it also creates an environment,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.500]   a milieu within the brain that allows us to then go
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.940]   learn how to couple or uncouple a particular emotion
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.420]   to an experience, or better language learning,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.160]   or better mathematical learning.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.820]   Last episode, we discussed some of the basic principles
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.640]   of neuroplasticity.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.660]   If you didn't hear that episode, no problem,
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.420]   I'll just review it quickly,
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.580]   which is that it's a falsehood that everything that we do
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.500]   and experience changes our brain.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.740]   The brain changes when certain neurochemicals,
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.180]   namely acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.980]   are released in ways and in the specific times
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.060]   that allow for neural circuits to be marked for change,
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.120]   and then the change occurs later during sleep.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.600]   Basically, you need a certain cocktail of chemicals
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.140]   released in the brain in order for a particular behavior
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.640]   to reshape the way that our brain works.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.920]   So the question really is,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.600]   what allows those neurochemicals to be released?
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.980]   And last episode, it talked all about focus.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.520]   If you haven't seen or heard that episode,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.800]   you might want to check it out
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.080]   about some specific tools and practices
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.760]   that can allow you to build up your capacity for focus
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.340]   and release certain chemicals in that cocktail.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.200]   But today, we're going to talk about the other chemicals
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.600]   in the cocktail, in particular, dopamine.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   And we're really going to center our discussion
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.840]   around this issue of making errors
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.780]   and why making errors is actually the signal
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.040]   that tells the brain, okay, it's time to change,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.280]   or more generally, it's time to pay attention to things
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.240]   so that you change.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.400]   And I really want to distinguish this point really clearly,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   which is that I'm going to talk today a lot
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.900]   about motor and vestibular, meaning balance programs,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.820]   but not just for learning motor commands and balance,
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.700]   but also for setting a stage
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.460]   or a kind of condition in your brain
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.860]   where you can go learn other things as well.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.620]   So let's talk about some classic experiments
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.100]   that really nail down what's most important
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.460]   in this discussion about plasticity.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.660]   So I mentioned last episode,
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.700]   and I'll just tell you right now,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.920]   again, the brain is incredibly plastic
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.940]   from about birth until about age 25.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.160]   And then somewhere about 25,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.500]   it's not like the day after your 26th birthday,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.900]   plasticity closes.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.460]   There's a kind of tapering off of plasticity
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.260]   and you need different mechanisms
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.660]   to engage plasticity as an adult.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.780]   Knowing how to tap into these plasticity mechanisms
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.460]   is very powerful.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.180]   The simplest example is if I hear something off to my right,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.260]   I look to my right.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.780]   If I hear it on the left, I look to my left.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.460]   If I hear it right in front of me,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.800]   I keep looking right in front of me.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.400]   And that's because our maps of visual space
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.960]   and our maps of auditory space
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.540]   and our maps of motor space
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.800]   are aligned to one another in perfect register.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.840]   It's an incredible feature of our nervous system.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.400]   It takes place in a structure called the superior colliculus,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.600]   although you don't need to know that name.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.540]   Superior colliculus has layers,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.320]   literally stacks of neurons, like in a sandwich,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.200]   where the zero point right in front of me,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.700]   or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.900]   or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left,
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.240]   are aligned so that the auditory neurons,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.040]   the ones that care about sounds at 15 degrees to my right,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.160]   sit directly below the neurons
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.740]   that look at 15 degrees to my right in my visual system.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.780]   And when I reach over to this direction,
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.660]   there's a signal that's sent down through those layers
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.420]   that says 15 degrees off to the right
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.860]   is the direction to look, it's the direction to listen,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.900]   and it's the direction to move if I need to move.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.620]   So there's an alignment, and this is really powerful,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.620]   and this is what allows us to move through space
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.900]   and function in our lives in a really fluid way.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.920]   It's set up during development,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.580]   but there've been some important experiments
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.560]   that have revealed that these maps are plastic,
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.820]   meaning they can shift, they're subject to neuroplasticity,
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.980]   and there are specific rules that allow us to shift them.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.480]   So here's the key experiment.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.300]   The key experiment was done by a colleague of mine,
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.140]   who's now retired, but whose work is absolutely fundamental
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.980]   in the field of neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.540]   The Knudsen Lab and many of the Knudsen Lab
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.140]   scientific offspring showed that if one
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.000]   is to wear prism glasses that shift the visual field,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.740]   that eventually there'll be a shift
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.220]   in the representation of the auditory and motor maps too.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.120]   Now, what they initially did is they looked
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   at young subjects, and what they did is they moved
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.120]   the visual world by making them wear prism glasses
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.480]   so that, for instance, if my pen is out in front of me
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.300]   at five degrees off center,
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.560]   so just a little bit off center,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.400]   if you're listening to this,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.980]   this would be like just a little bit to my right,
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.160]   but in these prism glasses,
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.460]   I actually see that pen way over far on my right.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.580]   So it's actually here, but I see it over there
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.600]   because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.500]   What happens is in the first day or so,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.800]   you ask people or you ask animal subjects or whatever
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.120]   to reach for this object and they reach to the wrong place
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   because they're seeing it where it isn't.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   But what you find is that in young individuals
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.080]   within a day or two, they start adjusting
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.880]   their motor behavior in exactly the right way
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.280]   so that they always reach to the correct location.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.920]   So they hear a sound at one location,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.640]   they see the object that ought to make that sound
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.760]   at a different location,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.320]   and they somehow are able to adjust their motor behavior
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.680]   to reach to the correct location.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.880]   It's incredible.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.400]   And what it tells us is that these maps
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   that are aligned to one another can move and shift
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.240]   and it happens best in young individuals.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.840]   If you do this in older individuals,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.800]   in most cases, it takes a very long time
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.640]   for the maps to shift and in some cases they never shift.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.760]   So this is a very experimental scenario,
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.520]   but it's an important one to understand
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.900]   because it really tamps down the fact
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.120]   that we have the capacity to create dramatic shifts
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.280]   in our representation of the outside world.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.560]   So how can we get plasticity as adults
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.900]   that mimics the plasticity that we get
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.220]   when we are juveniles?
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.240]   Well, the Knudsen Lab and other labs have looked at this
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.200]   and it's really interesting.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.000]   The signal that generates the plasticity
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.360]   is the making of errors.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.400]   It's the reaches and failures that signal
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.320]   to the nervous system that this is not working
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.760]   and therefore the shifts start to take place.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.840]   And this is so fundamentally important
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.880]   because I think most people understandably get frustrated,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.640]   like they're trying to learn a piece on the piano
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.080]   and they don't know, they can't do it,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.480]   or they're trying to write a piece of code
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.800]   or they're trying to access some sort of motor behavior
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.880]   and they can't do it.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.760]   And the frustration drives them crazy
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.900]   and like, I can't do it, I can't do it.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.520]   When they don't realize that the errors themselves
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.560]   are signaling to the brain and nervous system,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.000]   something's not working.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And of course the brain doesn't understand
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.280]   the words something isn't working.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.060]   The brain doesn't even understand frustration
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.660]   as an emotional state.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.740]   The brain understands the neurochemicals that are released,
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.700]   namely epinephrine and acetylcholine,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.280]   but also, and we'll get into this,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.160]   the molecule dopamine when we start to approximate
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.920]   the correct behavior just a little bit
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.280]   and we start getting a little bit right.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.000]   So what happens is when we make errors,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.720]   the nervous system starts releasing neurotransmitters
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.520]   and neuromodulators that say,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.640]   we better change something in the circuitry.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.880]   And so errors are the basis for neuroplasticity
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.920]   and for learning.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.040]   And I wish that this was more prominent out there.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.160]   I guess this is why I'm saying it.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.620]   And humans do not like this feeling of frustration
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.860]   and making errors.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.040]   The few that do, do exceedingly well in whatever pursuits
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.700]   they happen to be involved in.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.660]   The ones that don't generally don't do well.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.160]   They generally don't learn much.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.000]   And if you think about it,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.620]   why would your nervous system ever change?
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.100]   Why would it ever change?
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.400]   Unless there was something to be afraid of,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.260]   something that made us feel awful will signal
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.980]   that the nervous system needs to change,
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.420]   or there's an error in our performance.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.660]   So it turns out that the feedback of these errors,
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.200]   the reaching to the wrong location,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.520]   starts to release a number of things.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.220]   And now you've heard about them many times,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.560]   but this would be epinephrine.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.420]   It increases alertness, acetylcholine focus,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.940]   because if acetylcholine is released,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.100]   it creates an opportunity to focus on the error margin,
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.540]   the distance between what it is that you're doing
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.660]   and what it is that you would like to do.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.620]   And then the nervous system starts to make changes
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.300]   almost immediately in order to try
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.660]   and get the behavior right.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.940]   And when you start getting it even a little bit right,
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.820]   that third molecule comes online or is released,
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.100]   which is dopamine,
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.100]   which allows for the plastic changes to occur very fast.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.180]   Now this is what all happens very naturally in young brains,
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.380]   but in old brains, it tends to be pretty slow,
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.060]   except for in two conditions.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.780]   So let me just pause and just say this.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.340]   If you are uncomfortable making errors
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.460]   and you get frustrated easily,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.380]   if you leverage that frustration
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.980]   toward drilling deeper into the endeavor,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.380]   you are setting yourself up
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.900]   for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.240]   But if you take that frustration
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.220]   and you walk away from the endeavor,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.140]   you are essentially setting up plasticity
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.140]   to rewire you according to what happens afterwards,
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.220]   which is generally feeling pretty miserable.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.660]   So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.900]   that continuing to drill into a process
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.140]   to the point of frustration,
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.380]   but then staying with that process for a little bit longer,
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.780]   and I'll define exactly what I mean by a little bit,
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   is the most important thing for adult learning,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.520]   as well as childhood learning,
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.060]   but adult learning in particular.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.300]   Now the Knudsen lab did two very important
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.020]   sets of experiments.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.860]   The first one, which showed that juveniles
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.940]   can make these massive shifts in their map representations.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.300]   They get a lot of plasticity all at once.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.100]   It happens very fast in the period of just a couple days.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.960]   In adults, it tends to be very slow,
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.540]   and most individuals never actually accomplish
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.620]   the full map shift.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.340]   They don't get the plasticity.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.520]   Then what they did is they started making
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.620]   the increment of change smaller.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.460]   So instead of shifting the world a huge amount
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.380]   by putting prisms that shifted the visual world,
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.300]   you know, all the way over to the right,
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.680]   they did this incrementally.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.740]   So first they put on prisms that shifted it
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.180]   just a little bit, you know,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.980]   and just like seven degrees, I believe was the exact number.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.180]   And then it was 14 degrees, and then it was 28 degrees.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.900]   And so what they found was that the adult nervous system
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.140]   can tolerate smaller and smaller errors over time,
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.500]   but that you can stack those errors
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.180]   so that you can get a lot of plasticity.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.400]   Put simply, incremental learning as an adult
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.700]   is absolutely essential.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.860]   You are not going to get massive shifts
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.040]   in your representations of the outside world.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.500]   So how do you make small errors as opposed to big errors?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   Well, the key is smaller bouts of focused learning
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.940]   for smaller bits of information.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.020]   It's a mistake to try and learn a lot of information
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.460]   in one learning bout as an adult.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.140]   Now, there is one way to get a lot of plasticity
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.300]   all at once as an adult.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.860]   There is that kind of holy grail thing of, you know,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.820]   getting massive plasticity as you would
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.540]   when you were a young person, but as an adult.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.900]   And the Knudsen lab revealed this
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.900]   by setting a very serious contingency on the learning.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.540]   What they did was they had a situation
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.420]   where subjects had to find food
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.220]   that was displaced in their visual world,
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.260]   again, by putting prisms, and they had to find the food,
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.820]   and the food made a noise.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   There was a noise set kind of the location of the food
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.780]   through an array of speakers.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.780]   Basically, in order to eat at all, they needed plasticity.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.580]   And then what happened was remarkable.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.100]   What they observed is that the plasticity as an adult
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.020]   can be as dramatic, as robust as it is in a young person
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.460]   or in a young animal subject,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.180]   provided that there's a serious incentive
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.380]   for the plasticity to occur.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.580]   And this is absolutely important to understand,
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.300]   which is that how badly we need or want the plasticity
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.780]   determines how fast that plasticity will arrive.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.780]   This means that the importance of something,
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.620]   how important something is to us,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.940]   actually gates the rate of plasticity
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.060]   and the magnitude of plasticity.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.380]   And this is why just passively going through most things,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.020]   going through the motions, as we say,
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.860]   or just getting our reps in, quote unquote,
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.180]   is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.300]   If we actually have to accomplish something
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   in order to eat or in order to get our ration of income,
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.960]   we will reshape our nervous system very, very quickly.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   And so I think that the studies that Knudsen did
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.820]   showing that incremental learning
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.300]   can create a huge degree of plasticity as an adult,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.220]   as well as when the contingency is very high,
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.180]   meaning we need to eat or we need to make an income,
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.820]   or we need to do something that's vitally important for us,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.060]   that plasticity can happen in these enormous leaps,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.940]   just like they can in adolescence and young adulthood.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.980]   That points to the fact
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.660]   that it has to be a neurochemical system.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.900]   There has to be an underlying mechanism.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.780]   All the chemicals that we're about to talk about
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.060]   are released from drug stores, if you will,
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.500]   chemical stores that already reside in all of our brains.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.900]   And the key is how to tap into those stores.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.780]   And so we're going to next talk about
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.980]   what are the specific behaviors
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.100]   that liberate particular categories of chemicals
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.260]   that allow us to make the most of incremental learning
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.420]   and that set the stage for plasticity
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.700]   that is similar enough or mimics
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.540]   these high contingency states like the need to get food
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.560]   or really create a sense of internal urgency,
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.620]   chemical urgency, if you will.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.820]   If you've heard previous episodes of this podcast,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.780]   you may have heard me talk about ultradian rhythms,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.420]   which are these 90-minute rhythms
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.900]   that break up our 24-hour day.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.220]   They help break up our sleep into different cycles of sleep,
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.860]   like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.580]   And in waking states, they help us,
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.660]   or I should say they break up our day in ways
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.260]   that allow us to learn best
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.320]   within 90-minute cycles, et cetera.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.340]   Today, we're really talking about how to tap into plasticity
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.580]   through the completion of a task
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.780]   or working towards something repetitively and making errors.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.100]   The ultradian cycle says that
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.380]   for the first five to 10 minutes of doing that,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.740]   your mind is going to drift
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.840]   and your focus will probably kick in
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.620]   provided that you're visually,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.420]   you're restricting your visual world
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.260]   to just the material in front of you,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.380]   something we talked about last episode,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.540]   somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.460]   And then at best, you're probably going to get
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.460]   about an hour of deliberate tunnel vision learning in there.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.380]   Your mind will drift.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.700]   And then toward the end of that,
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.980]   what is now an hour and 10 or hour and 20-minute cycle,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.940]   your brain will start to flicker in and out.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.660]   You're trying your best to accomplish something
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.900]   and you're failing.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.760]   You want to keep making errors for this period of time
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.300]   that I'm saying will last anywhere
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.620]   for about seven to 30 minutes.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.900]   It is exceedingly frustrating,
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.840]   but that frustration, it liberates the chemical cues
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.940]   that signal that plasticity needs to happen.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.580]   And it is the case that when we come back
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.980]   a day or two later in a learning bout after a nap
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.100]   or a night or two of deep rest,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.220]   then what we find is that we can remember certain things
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.540]   and the motor pathways work
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.000]   and we don't always get it perfectly,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.780]   but we get a lot of it right,
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.220]   whereas we got it wrong before.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.380]   So that seven to 30-minute intense learning bout
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.820]   specifically about making errors,
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.940]   I want to really underscore that.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.540]   And it's not about, as I mentioned before,
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.380]   coming up with some little hack or trick
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.140]   or something of that sort.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.080]   It's really about trying to cue the nervous system
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.380]   that something needs to change
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.640]   because otherwise it simply won't change.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.100]   I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.100]   by doing the following.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.500]   Learn to attach dopamine in a subjective way
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.740]   to this process of making errors
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.100]   because that's really combining two modes of plasticity
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.460]   in ways that together can accelerate the plasticity.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.820]   In other words, making failures, failing repetitively,
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.220]   provided we're engaged in a very specific set of behaviors
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.540]   when we do it, as well as telling ourselves
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.900]   that those failures are good for learning and good for us,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.340]   creates an outsized effect on the rate of plasticity.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.620]   It accelerates plasticity.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.420]   Now, some of you might be asking, and I get asked a lot,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.700]   well, how do I get dopamine to be released?
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.780]   You know, can I just tell myself
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.320]   that something is good when it's bad?
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.040]   Well, actually, yes, believe it or not.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.020]   Dopamine is one of these incredible molecules
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.420]   that both can be released according to things
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.120]   that are hardwired in us to release dopamine.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.740]   Again, things like food, sex, warmth when we're cold,
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.700]   cool environments when we're too warm.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.500]   It's that kind of pleasure molecule overall,
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.700]   but it's also highly subjective
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.340]   what releases dopamine in one person versus the next.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.260]   So everyone releases dopamine in response
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.860]   to those very basic kind of behaviors and activities,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.820]   but dopamine is also released
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.880]   according to what we subjectively believe is good for us,
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.420]   and that's what's so powerful about it.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.980]   In fact, a book that I highly recommend
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.700]   if you want to read more about dopamine,
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.300]   it's a book that, frankly, I wish I had written.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.260]   It's such a wonderful book.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.940]   It's called "The Molecule of More,"
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.920]   and it really talks about dopamine
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.820]   not just as a molecule associated with reward,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.580]   but a molecule associated with motivation and pursuit
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.040]   and just how subjectively controlled dopamine can be.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.500]   So make lots of errors.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.420]   Tell yourself that those errors are important
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.420]   and good for your overall learning goals.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.060]   So learn to attach dopamine,
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.340]   meaning release dopamine in your brain
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.940]   when you start to make errors.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.020]   Once you're attaching dopamine
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.580]   to this process of making errors,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.380]   then I start getting lots of questions
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.060]   that really are the right questions,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.100]   which are, you know, how often should I do this,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.220]   and when should I be doing this, and at what time?
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.500]   Well, I've talked a little bit about this
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.860]   in previous episodes, but as long as we're now
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.680]   kind of into the nitty-gritty of tools and application,
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.260]   each of us have some natural times throughout the day
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.700]   when we are going to be much better
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.340]   at tolerating these errors and much more focused
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.540]   on what it is that we're trying to do.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.500]   Last episode was about focus,
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.140]   but chances are that you can't focus as well
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.200]   at 4 p.m. as you can at 10 a.m.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.020]   It differs for everybody, depending on when you're sleeping
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.380]   and your kind of natural chemistry and rhythms,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.460]   but find the time or times of day
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.020]   when you naturally have the highest mental acuity,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.780]   and that's really when you want to engage
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.420]   in these learning bouts.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.660]   And then get to the point where you're making errors,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.740]   and then keep making errors for seven to 30 minutes.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.380]   Just keep making those errors and drill through it,
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.580]   and you're almost seeking frustration,
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.600]   and if you can find some pleasure in the frustration,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.340]   yes, that is a state that exists,
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.380]   you have created the optimal neurochemical milieu
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.620]   for learning that thing,
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.340]   but then here's the beauty of it.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.860]   You also have created the optimal milieu
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.940]   for learning other things afterward.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.260]   At least for an hour or so, I would say,
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.900]   you're going to be in a state of heightened learning.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.980]   Again, these aren't gimmicks.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.160]   These tap into these basic mechanisms of plasticity,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.220]   and the three that I'd like to talk about next
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.460]   are balance, meaning the vestibular system,
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.140]   as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.620]   or autonomic arousal.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.860]   And if none of that makes sense,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.900]   I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.940]   and what it is and why it works
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.060]   for opening up neuroplasticity.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.140]   Let's talk about limbic friction.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.980]   Limbic friction, I realize,
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.420]   is not something you're going to find
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.020]   in any of the textbooks,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.720]   but it is an important principle
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.660]   that captures a lot of information that is in textbooks,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.720]   both neurobiology and psychology,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.660]   and it has some really important implications.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:56.100]   Limbic friction is my attempt to give a name to something
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.860]   that is more nuanced and mechanistic than stress,
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.340]   because typically when we hear about stress,
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.300]   we think of heartbeat going too fast,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.940]   breathing too fast, sweating,
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.500]   and not being in a state that we want.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.060]   We're too alert and we want to be more calm.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.400]   And indeed, that's one condition
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.140]   in which we have limbic friction,
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.860]   meaning our limbic system is taking control
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.020]   of a number of different aspects of our autonomic
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.580]   or automatic biology,
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.160]   and we are struggling to control that
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.640]   through what we call top-down mechanisms.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.180]   We're trying to calm down
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.380]   in order to reduce that level of arousal.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.420]   We're all familiar with this.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.020]   It's called the stress response.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.820]   However, there's another aspect of stress
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.680]   that's just as important,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.340]   which is when we're tired and we're fatigued
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.020]   and we need to engage,
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.140]   we need to be more alert than we are.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   And so what I call limbic friction
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.140]   is really designed to describe the fact
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.580]   that when our autonomic nervous system
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.700]   isn't where we want it,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.760]   meaning we're trying to be more alert
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.600]   or we're trying to be less alert,
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.480]   both of those feel stressful to people.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.520]   But the reason I'm bringing this up
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.140]   is that in order to access neuroplasticity,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.420]   you need these components of focus.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.400]   You need the component of attaching subjective reward.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.220]   You need to make errors, all this stuff.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.620]   And a lot of people find it difficult
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.020]   to just get into the overall state to access those things.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.140]   Here's the beauty of it.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.620]   If you are too alert, meaning you're too anxious
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.580]   and you want to calm down in order to learn better,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.220]   there are things that you can do.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.780]   The two that I've spoken about previously
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.860]   on various podcasts,
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.300]   and I'll just review them really quickly,
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.900]   are the double inhale, exhale.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.260]   So inhaling twice through the nose
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.540]   and exhaling once through the mouth.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.380]   This is what's called a physiological sigh.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.080]   It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.200]   The other thing is starting to remove your tunnel vision.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.260]   When you use tunnel vision, you're very focused.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.180]   That epinephrine is released by dilating your field of gaze,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.900]   so-called panoramic vision.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.060]   But the other side of limbic friction is important too.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.140]   If you are too tired and you can't focus,
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.500]   well, then it's going to be impossible
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.380]   to even get to the starting line, so to speak,
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.240]   for engaging in neuroplasticity
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.020]   through incremental learning, et cetera.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.560]   So in that case, there are other methods
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.700]   that you can do to wake yourself up.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.540]   The best thing you should do is get a good night's sleep,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.700]   but that's not always possible,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.380]   or use an NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.880]   But if you've already done those things,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.700]   or you're simply exhausted for whatever other reason,
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.060]   then there are other things that I often get asked about,
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.020]   like sure, a cup of coffee or super oxygenation breathing,
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.660]   which means inhaling more than exhaling on average
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.900]   in a breathing bout.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.320]   Now we're sort of getting toward the realm
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.780]   of like how you could trick your nervous system
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.660]   into waking up.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.260]   And if you bring more oxygen in
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.860]   by making your inhales deeper and longer,
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.500]   you will become more alert.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.580]   You'll start to actually deploy norepinephrine
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.980]   if you breathe very fast.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.420]   So there are things that you can do
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.900]   to move up or down this so-called autonomic arousal arc.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.560]   And what you want to ask
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.260]   before you undergo any learning bout
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.420]   is how much limbic friction am I experiencing?
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.100]   Am I too alert and I want to be calmer,
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.240]   or am I too calm and too sleepy
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.300]   and I want to be more alert?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.280]   You're going to need to engage in behaviors
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.240]   that bring you to the starting line in order to learn.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.340]   There are other things that you can do
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.780]   in order to then learn better and faster
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.120]   besides incremental learning,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.300]   and those center on the vestibular system.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.980]   Why the vestibular system to access neuroplasticity?
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.460]   Well, we have a hardwired system for balance,
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.060]   and here's how it works in as simple terms
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.620]   as I can possibly come up with.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.940]   As we move through space, or even if we're stationary,
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.660]   your brain doesn't really know where your body is
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.460]   except through that proprioceptive feedback.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.500]   The main way it knows is through three planes of movement
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.220]   that we call pitch, which is like nodding.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.100]   So if I nod like this, that's pitch.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.220]   Then there's yaw, which is like shaking my head no.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.420]   And then there's roll from side to side,
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.940]   like when a puppy looks at you like that kind of thing.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.660]   Okay, so pitch, yaw, and roll.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.620]   Our ears have two main roles.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.740]   One is to hear, right, to perceive sound waves
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   or take in sound waves for perception, so-called hearing.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.200]   And the other is balance or vestibular function.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.780]   So sitting in our ears are these semicircular canals,
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.780]   and they're these little tubes where these little stones,
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.140]   they're actually little bits of calcium,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.060]   roll back and forth like little marbles.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.140]   When we roll this way, they roll this way.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.140]   When we pitch, when we go from side to side,
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.860]   there's some that sit flat like this, and they go.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.740]   Like marbles inside of a hula hoop.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   And then we have roll.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.860]   There's some that are kind of at 45 degrees to those,
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.020]   and it's kind of pitch, yaw, and roll.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.320]   So you go, okay, great.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.900]   That sends signals to the rest of our brain and body
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.660]   that tell us how to compensate
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.340]   for shifts relative to gravity.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.340]   I say, okay, I thought we were talking about plasticity,
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.800]   but this is where it gets really, really cool.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.180]   meaning when we are off balance and we have to compensate
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.420]   by looking at, thinking about,
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.060]   or responding to the world differently,
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.700]   cause an area of our brain called the cerebellum.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.060]   It actually means mini brain.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.620]   It looks like a little mini brain
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.980]   like tucked below our cortex in the back.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.960]   Cause the cerebellum to signal
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.040]   some of these deeper brain centers
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.340]   that release dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.340]   And that's because these circuits in the inner ear,
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.740]   et cetera, and the cerebellum,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:37.500]   they were designed to recalibrate our motor movements
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.200]   when our relationship to gravity changes,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.640]   something fundamental to survival.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.500]   We can't afford to be falling down all the time
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.780]   or missing things that we grab for,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.980]   or running in the wrong direction
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.500]   when something is pursuing us.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.040]   These are hardwired circuits
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.180]   that tap right into these chemical pathways.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.180]   And those chemical pathways are the gates to plasticity.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.340]   So I really want to spell this out clearly
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.820]   cause I've given a lot of information today.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.660]   The first thing is,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.580]   how are you arriving to the learning bout?
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.940]   You need to make sure your level
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.620]   of autonomic arousal is correct.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.660]   The ideal state is going to be clear, calm, and focused,
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.180]   maybe a little bit more on the arousal level,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.860]   like heightened arousal.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.640]   So understand limbic friction,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.980]   understand that you can be too tired,
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.900]   in which case you're going to need
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.460]   to get yourself a little more alert,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.020]   or you can be too alert
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   and you're going to need to get yourself calmer.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.580]   So the first gate is to arrive at learning
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.860]   at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.520]   Clear and focused is best,
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.700]   but don't obsess over being right there.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.920]   It's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.840]   Then you want to make errors.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.940]   We talked about that.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.840]   And this vestibular motor sensory relationship
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.740]   is absolutely key
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.080]   if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.620]   And we talked about another feature,
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.620]   which is setting a contingency.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.780]   If there's a reason,
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.420]   an important reason for you to actually learn,
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.100]   even if you're making failures,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.900]   the learning will be accelerated.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.460]   So there's really four things
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.260]   that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.940]   And I would say that these also apply to young people.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.680]   And there's an interesting kind of a thought experiment
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   there as well,
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.060]   which is if you look at children,
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.580]   they are moving a lot in different dimensions.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.000]   Whatever sport the kids are playing,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   or even if they don't play a sport,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.140]   they tend to move in a lot of different relationships
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.300]   to gravity, more dimensionality to their movements,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.700]   I should say, than adult.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.780]   As we age, we get less good at engaging in neuroplasticity.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.540]   Part of that is because as we get older,
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.820]   we tend to get more linear and more regular
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.240]   about specific kinds of movements.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.740]   So you sort of have to wonder
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.540]   whether or not the lack of plasticity
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.940]   or the reduced plasticity in older individuals,
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.040]   which includes me,
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.820]   would reflect the fact
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.740]   that those chemicals aren't being deployed
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.220]   because we're not engaging in certain behaviors
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.700]   as opposed to we can't engage in the behaviors
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.520]   because the chemicals aren't being deployed.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.220]   So I want to make sure that I underscore the fact
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.760]   that this vestibular thing that I've been describing
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.140]   is a way to really accentuate plasticity.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.960]   It's tapping into an inborn biological mechanism
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.380]   where the cerebellum has outputs
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.580]   to these deep brain nuclei associated with dopamine,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.660]   acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.740]   That's kind of an amplifier on plasticity,
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.100]   as is high contingency.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.200]   If you really need to learn conversational French
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.180]   to save your relationship,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.380]   chances are you're going to learn it.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.320]   Now, there are limits to this, of course, too.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.660]   If someone puts a gun to my head and says,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.380]   "Learn conversational French in the next 120 seconds,"
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.880]   I think we would probably be my only response
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.620]   because I can't stuff in all the knowledge all at once.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.040]   I mean, I think that's the dream of brain machine interface
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.820]   that one will be able to download a chip
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.980]   into their hippocampus or cortex
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.100]   or some other brain structure
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.300]   that would allow them to download conversational French.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.820]   And someday we may get to that.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.980]   And so my overall goal here in this episode
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.380]   and with this podcast is to give you some understanding
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.620]   of the mechanisms and the insights
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.880]   into the underlying biology that allow you to tailor
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.000]   what these kind of foundational mechanisms are
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.500]   to suit your particular learning needs.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.340]   So I very much thank you for your time and attention.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.220]   I know it's a lot of information
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.660]   and it takes a bit of focus and attention
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.380]   and certainly will trigger plasticity
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.340]   to learn all this information.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.700]   I want to encourage you and just remind you
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.160]   that you don't have to grasp it all at once,
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.820]   that it is here archived,
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.660]   and that if you want to return to the information,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.120]   it will still be here.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.460]   And that I, most of all,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.540]   really appreciate your interest in science.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.420]   Thank you so much.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.000]   [upbeat music]
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.580]   (upbeat music)
