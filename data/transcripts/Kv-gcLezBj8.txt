[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.060]   Despite having dozens of cards and millions of points, I recently went deep on Citibank,
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.140]   which led me to opening a few new Citi cards. And now I'm thinking that Citi might be one of
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.980]   the most underrated issuers for earning points on your spending. So today I'm going to go deep
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.040]   on the entire Citi card lineup, highlighting the ones you might want to consider and putting them
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.260]   in a tier list. I'll break down Citi's thank you points program and the best ways to use those
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.300]   points. I'll share a bunch of tips and tricks I've picked up from my experience with Citi.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.320]   And finally, I'll be putting Citi's top two card combo up against the best two card combos from
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.400]   every other major issuer. And I think you will be shocked at what I learned. I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.700]   And if you enjoy this episode, please share with a friend or leave a comment or review. And if you

[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.600]   intro, I've been really excited about Citi lately. So that's why I'm going to do a deep dive into their
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.060]   card lineup. And as I do it, I'm going to be filling out a tier list where I rank all the cards. So for
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.820]   those not familiar with tier lists, the highest tier is S. Maybe that means special or super. It's
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.800]   not entirely clear. Followed by a traditional A, B, C, D letter grade. And if anyone out there is
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.540]   asking if I'm just doing this episode because Citi is having some big affiliate deal where I get paid
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.980]   lots of money for referrals, that unfortunately couldn't be farther from the truth because despite
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.580]   that I do have links for Citi cards on the website, none of them are affiliate links or even referral
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.620]   links. So even if every single one of you listening opens up a Citi card, I won't earn a thing or get
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.860]   any benefit. I genuinely just wanted to do this episode because I opened two Citi cards after going
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.440]   deep on the program and I feel like I was missing out. Finally, in addition to Citi, I think I'm going
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.920]   to make this a recurring series where I break down all the cards from every major issuer. So please,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.560]   if you have feedback on that concept, you can send me an email, podcast at allthehacks.com or
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.200]   on the website, use the contact form. So let's get into it. Citi has a ton of cards. According to their
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.460]   website, there are 24 of them. I'm going to focus on the ones that are most interesting because there
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.240]   are a ton of cards where it's random stuff like the L.L. Bean MasterCard, the Dillard's card and those
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.160]   things. It's not that you might not get value if you really care about those retailers, but they're a
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.460]   little bit of an edge case. So I'm going to skip those and start with the thank you points earning
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.480]   cards. I think Citi thank you points is a really competitive program. They've got a ton of
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.040]   transfer partners, some that are unique and have better earning rates or transfer rates than other
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.260]   programs. So the marquee card in the thank you point ecosystem is the Citi Strata Premier card.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.220]   This is one of the two cards I recently opened up and I've been pretty impressed with its earning.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   So two big highlights for this card is the signup bonus, which is often 75,000 points,
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.960]   though right now at recording, it's 60,000 points after spending 4K in three months. And then the big
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.020]   other one is the earnings. You get 3x points on groceries, gas, dining, hotel, and airfare. I think
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.000]   those are a few of the major categories that people spend money on. You do also get 10x points on hotels,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.520]   car rentals, and attractions through Citi travel, which is a bit of a recurring theme in a lot of
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.640]   these cards. But as I've talked about in a lot of previous episodes, I don't love booking in the travel
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.260]   portal unless there's a bigger incentive. So I kind of write that off. The card does have a $95 annual fee.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   To make up for that, they give you a $100 credit towards a hotel stay in Citi travel,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   as long as you spend more than $500. I have not yet decided whether I'm ever even going to use that
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   credit. I don't know if, you know, 20% off one stay ends up, and obviously that's only if you hit
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.940]   exactly $500. I don't know if that ends up being worth the downsides of booking in the travel portal.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.060]   It earns 1x points on everything else. It has no foreign transaction fees. And while many Citi cards,
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.100]   I will knock for not having travel protections and purchase protections, this card does have some.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.320]   They are not as strong as the ones you'll see from other major issuers. But they do have trip delay,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.020]   trip interruption, lost luggage, damaged luggage, and rental car coverage, though that rental car
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.180]   coverage is secondary to your primary insurance. And then they do have purchase protection, but it's
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.580]   also limited. They've got extended warranty of an additional two years, and then damage and theft
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.000]   protection for 90 days. So it has some protections, but not nearly as much as other cards. But the real
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.920]   marquee thing is that you're earning 3x on groceries, gas, dining, hotel, and airfare.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.740]   So for me, if I jump into my little tier list, I think this is a really, really great card. I'm
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.040]   putting this one in the S tier because those categories, earning 3x transferable points in a
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.600]   program for a $95 fee card with a decent signup bonus is just about everything I'm looking for. And I've
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.980]   been using the card a ton in the last few weeks, both to hit the signup bonus and because
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.240]   3x in those categories is pretty compelling. Interestingly enough, despite that City has a
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.640]   ton of cards, only three of them really earn thank you points that are transferable. The
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.120]   others earn are marketed as cash back. But if you have the City Strata Premier, you can transfer those
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.300]   points. The next few cards on the list are sometimes marketed as earning thank you points, sometimes
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.780]   marketed as earning cash back, but they don't always come with the ability to transfer unless they're
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.040]   paired with the Strata Premier. Or if you're a legacy City card holder and you have the
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.860]   City Prestige card, they're also able to be transferred to airlines. And that's where you
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.880]   get a lot of the value out of it. I think you could get a ton of value from City as just a
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.800]   pure cash back play. And we'll get to that. But the transfer partners are pretty interesting,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   especially when you pair up a couple cards.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.760]   The next card I'm going to mention is a surprisingly interesting one. And that is the AT&T points plus
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.800]   card. This one is marketed as earning thank you points, which is why I'm doing it next.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.540]   It is not that compelling. The signup bonus is $200 on $1,000 of spend in three months.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.960]   There is no annual fee, does have a 3% foreign transaction fee. You get 3x points on gas and
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.080]   EV charging and 2x on grocery. I think you do better than that on a lot of cards. If you are
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.920]   an AT&T customer, you do save $20 a month up to $240 a year on this card. So I could make an argument
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:17.580]   that a card that earns you $240 a year is interesting with no annual fee. But one, you're
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.860]   probably spending way more than $240 a year having AT&T in the first place. So you'd be better
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.900]   switching. But it is a points earning card. So I feel like it is worth mentioning in the list.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:36.260]   But I am unfortunately going to put this card in the C tier list. And you'll see what D entails in a
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.540]   moment. But you know, C tier for the purposes of this episode is not a compelling place to live.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:48.420]   Next card, there was a Sears card for a long time that Citi had. It actually had a bunch of
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.860]   interesting benefits. I'm not going to go deep into those because on April 12, they kind of
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.640]   effectively killed that card and said it is now going to be what's called the Citi Thank You Master
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.580]   Card. Now you can't get that card. So there's not an interesting website about it. And a lot of the
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.860]   interesting deals from that card are no longer going to be issued. So if you like these earning
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.980]   perks that it had, the Citi Shop Your Way card is going to be interesting. And we'll get to that.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.380]   This card is not that interesting. I'm going to go ahead and put it in the D tier because
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.880]   there's really nothing about this card that's compelling anymore at all. But the next card I'm
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.920]   really big fan of. And in fact, if I get another Citi card, this one's what's coming next. And that is the
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:33.620]   Citi Double Cash card. Now you've probably seen tons of ads for this card. It is a 2% unlimited cashback
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.860]   card. It's marketed as you get 1% when you spend the money and 1% when you pay it off. So I guess if you
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.020]   don't pay off your credit card, it's only a 1% card. But if you don't pay off your credit card, you should
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.340]   ignore this entire episode. Stop listening and focus your strategy on paying down credit cards
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.840]   because unless they're a 0% interest card, credit card debt is just not worth any amount of rewards,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.240]   any amount of points. In addition to that, it is no annual fee. It has a minor signup bonus. You get
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   $200 after spending $1,500 in six months, at least as of recording this, though it does come with a
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.220]   foreign transaction fee. So while it's a great everything card, it is not a great everything card when
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:18.080]   you're traveling overseas. And if you have the Citi Strata Premier card, then the cashback can be
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.460]   converted into points that can be transferred. So really great card to pair. In a way, if you have
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:31.080]   the Strata Premier, it's similar to the Capital One Venture X card or Venture card in that you get
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.260]   2x transferable points on every purchase. It has no travel protection and the only purchase protection
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.880]   it has is an extended warranty. So not the best card to be using for those kinds of purchase
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.360]   protections at all. And definitely not a card to put a lot of travel on it. Though for this year,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.280]   they're offering 5% back on stuff booked in city travel, hotel, rental car and attractions, not airfare.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:02.680]   So on its own, 2% cashback card, you know, with Robinhood out there with the Smartly card, though, it just kind of got
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.700]   knocked down pretty hard with Bank of America with Platinum Honors. There's a ton of cards out there that you could be
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:15.040]   earning more than 2%. But if you get the Premier and you get 2x transferable points, kind of interesting, not even kind of
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.400]   interesting, really interesting. So I'm going to put this in A tier because I think that it is a compelling card to have if you're in the
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   city ecosystem. And then last one in this group is the city custom cash card. On the surface, this card looks amazing
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:36.560]   because you get 5% back on whatever category you spend the most in. And the categories are really wide ranging restaurants, gas,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.840]   grocery, travel, transit, streaming, drug stores, home improvement, fitness clubs and live entertainment. And home improvement is
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.920]   probably the most notable one in here for me because I'm not aware of any other card that has a elevated earnings potential for that
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:59.220]   category. However, you're capped at only earning that 5% back on up to $500 per billing cycle, which means that you're only
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:08.840]   getting it on $6,000 a year. And so if you look at earning 5% on $6,000 or earning 5% on a 2x unlimited card, you're just
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:18.320]   getting a bonus of 3%. And so that's really just a max of $180 a year. Now, if you have the City Strata Premier, then that could be
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:25.420]   18,000 points a year over having the double cash. But where this kind of gets interesting, and we'll talk later about how City allows you to
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:32.140]   product change between different cards, you could have multiple of these custom cash cards. So I do know a few people who ended up with
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:39.780]   two or three or four of them. And they're like, this is my gas card. This is my travel card. This is my transit card. And if you figure you
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:48.560]   don't spend more than $500 during a billing cycle on gas, then this is effectively a 5x points on gas card. And I'm not familiar with
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:58.020]   another 5x transferable points gas card. So I do think that if you're in the City ecosystem, the City custom cash card is
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:08.520]   pretty good. I'm going to put it at B tier, because it's not quite that exciting with the cap of earning only $500 of 5x a month. But it does
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:15.540]   have no annual fee. So that's nice. Similar, you get no travel or purchase protection except extended warranty to the double cash
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:25.180]   also has a 3% foreign transaction fee. And I'm not sure why this card is different in this way. But you do get 5x or 5% back on all the
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:32.820]   same hotel rental car attractions and city travel. But for this card, it's through June 30th, 2026. I have no idea why they're doing these
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:41.640]   promotions on different schedules. So those are the main cards in the City thank you point or cashback ecosystem. The next I'm
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:49.580]   going to go into is the American Airlines ecosystem. So if you have no interest in American, though, maybe I will change your mind. You
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:56.840]   could skip through this time. Timestamps are in the show notes. But I will say one two things. One, as I've dug into Alaska Airlines, I've
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:04.420]   noticed that American Airlines status is also pretty beneficial to Alaska Airlines. And American Airlines is one of the
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.880]   easiest statuses to earn without needing to ever fly American. So if you don't fly a lot, or you're always flying on cheap
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.280]   seats, you don't think you're ever going to earn the status, you can spend your way to American status better than almost any
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.080]   other program out there. And if you fly Alaska a lot, American status gives you very, very similar comparable
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:30.320]   benefits. Whereas Alaska is much harder to spend your way to status, especially because they cap how many elite
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.520]   qualifying points you can even earn using an Alaska card to earn status. So I'll run through the four city
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:44.740]   cards. And I'll tell you why one of them is the second card I got, and is very lucrative in 2025. And I'm
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.520]   actually really excited about it. And I'll get there. This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market. You know that
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.800]   feeling when you're standing in the grocery store, staring at labels, trying to figure out what's actually
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.960]   healthy, but that ingredient list is so confusing. With two young kids, we are constantly trying to
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.780]   make sure the whole family eats clean, healthy food, but it can be a lot of work to make that happen.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.180]   And that's why I love Thrive Market. They're my go-to online grocery store for getting healthy
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.600]   essentials delivered straight to our door without ever having to leave the house. Unfortunately, there
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   are over 10,000 food additives allowed in the US, and it's hard to know what's actually safe. So I love
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.360]   that Thrive Market bans over a thousand harmful ingredients. Their team does all the hard work and
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.220]   make sure every product meets high quality clean standards. For example, one product we love from
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.740]   Thrive is Simple Mills. We feel so good giving it to our kids. Their sea salt almond flour crackers are
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:41.900]   fantastic, but lately I just can't stop snacking on their sweet thins. Also, Thrive Market has tons of
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.160]   filters so you can easily shop by whatever you need. Whether you want to find what's on sale,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.020]   you're looking for gluten-free snacks, or you want some high protein meals. I especially love that

[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.780]   your best interest. So let me save you some time because when I shut down my financial planning firm
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.460]   a few years ago, we did a ton of research on who to recommend to our clients, and we landed on Facet.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.420]   Facet makes professional financial advice actionable to everyone, and instead of charging a high percentage
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:38.040]   of your assets, they only charge a flat annual membership fee with investment management included.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.960]   With Facet, you'll get access to a team of CFP professionals and specialists providing guidance
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.260]   across retirement planning, tax strategy, estate planning, and more. So head on over to
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:56.380]   chrishutchins.com slash facet, F-A-C-E-T, to learn more about which membership option is best for you.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:02.220]   That's chrishutchins.com slash facet. So the first one's the mile up card. You get a
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:10.300]   paltry 15,000 bonus miles, though only after spending $500 in three months. It's a no annual fee card with
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:17.220]   3% foreign transaction fees. You get an extra 2x points on groceries and American Airlines, 1x on
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.660]   everything else. And you get 25% off food and beverage on American. You don't get checked bags.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:28.420]   You don't get priority boarding. There's really not a lot to like about this card. The only argument I
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:34.820]   could make for this card is if you are really trying to earn American Airlines status, and you need a card
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:40.120]   to spend on, and you're doing it for the loyalty points. Because the way American Airlines status works
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:47.000]   is you earn loyalty points. Base gold tier is $40,000 all the way up to $200,000 for executive
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.840]   platinum. And every dollar you spend on your card, you get a loyalty point. If you were a major spender
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.380]   at grocery stores, or there were gift cards or things that you were buying at grocery stores,
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:04.800]   and your primary spending category is groceries, then if you were also trying to get American status,
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.980]   then spending on this card would be more lucrative than the other cards because you'd be earning 2x
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.460]   American points. Now you're not earning 2x loyalty points, but you're getting two American miles for
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.420]   every dollar. So that's the only case I could make for this. But I don't know a lot of people who are
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:24.160]   spending a tremendous amount of money on groceries and trying to get American status. So I'm going to put
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.660]   the mile up card down in C tier because I really just don't think it's that compelling compared to the
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:35.620]   other options from American. So the next card is the platinum card has a much more interesting signup
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:42.340]   bonus. Right now, it's 50,000 points on 2500 and spend in three months does have a $99 annual fee,
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.160]   but at least right now they're waiving it for the first year, no foreign transaction fees, and you get
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:54.140]   2x American miles on restaurants, gas and American purchases. So similarly, all that said, not that
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.600]   compelling for anything other than if you want to earn American status, where it does start to have a
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.200]   benefit is if you fly American a decent amount, you get your first bag free for up to four people on the
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.120]   same reservation. And I think American bag fees are something like $40. So if you're doing round trip with a
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:17.800]   family of four checking four bags, that's $320 saved, you get preferred boarding and another 25% off food and
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.560]   beverage on American. So interesting if you're going for status interesting if you want to sign up bonus,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.760]   though I'd hold out for something like 75,000 points on this card. But if you do fly American a lot, but not
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:36.600]   enough to earn status, I would say getting free checked bags is a decent perk for this card. But if you fly American
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.640]   a lot, I imagine you would have status or you'd want one of the other cards in this platform. So I'm going to put this
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:49.940]   at a C tier. I think it's better than the mile up card, but not nearly as good as the next two on the list. So on the
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:55.740]   personal side, the next one's the city executive American card, much higher signup bonus, though much
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:03.360]   higher annual fee. So it's $595 for the card. It's got a 70,000 point signup bonus right now on spending
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.880]   $7,000 in three months has no foreign transaction fees. But it's pretty interesting for a few reasons.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.180]   So not necessarily on the earning, because the only elevated earning is 5x on American if you
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:23.280]   spend $150,000 on the card, but that's a tremendous amount. It does also earn 10x on hotels and car
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.360]   rentals through the city portal. I'm going to kind of exclude that right now. And then 1x on everything
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:35.560]   else. The reason to get this card is twofold. One, you get an Admirals Club membership. So if you travel
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.340]   American a lot, because one of the requirements for an Admirals Club membership to go in is to
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:46.100]   be flight American, or if you fly on Alaska, because the Admirals Club membership also allows you access
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.460]   to the Alaska lounge, and there's currently not a credit card that gives you access to Alaska lounge,
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.720]   this could be a really interesting card. You can go into those lounges with your family, adult spouse,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.940]   and children, or up to two guests. And the really interesting thing about this card, if you have a few
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:07.360]   friends that are all interested, is you can add up to three authorized users on the card for $175 total.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.160]   So if you had one person and three authorized users, and you all split the total annual fees,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:21.080]   you'd be spending $192 a year for American Admirals Club access. Now, if you don't fly on
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.580]   American or Alaska, having Admirals Club access is not that interesting. And one caveat is the Admirals Club
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.740]   access you get as an authorized user does not allow you into the Alaska lounge. So only the primary user
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:40.780]   gets that Alaska lounge perk. So it's pretty interesting if you want Admirals Club access or Alaska lounge
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:49.160]   access, because otherwise, the cost of an Admirals Club membership is $750 to $850 a year. Other perks, you get
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.460]   your first bag free this time for up to eight travelers. One nice thing about the bag perk on
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.620]   American is you don't even have to pay for the flight with your card. Some other airlines do have
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:04.200]   that requirement. You get priority check-in, screening, and boarding. And then they have a bunch of coupon
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:10.320]   style credits. And this is not uncommon for premium cards these days. I'm going to say these credits are
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.100]   not as valuable as some other ones. But it really depends on how you travel and spend money. You get
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:21.480]   $120 a year for booking Avis and budget car rentals and paying for them directly on the card. You get $10
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:27.720]   a month for $120 a year on Grubhub. To me, it feels like those two would be reasonably easy to use. We do
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.420]   use Grubhub probably once a month. But if we had this card, we'd be doing it twice. So twice a month. I don't
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.540]   know if we use it that much. And then you get $10 a month credit with Lyft, but only after three rides
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.980]   each month. So I think that for us would be really hard to use. And then you get TSA Global Entry
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.240]   covered, which for someone playing this game, I'm guessing you already have a card that covers that.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.340]   So those credits to me aren't worth nearly what they're marketed as. But the other big benefit here...
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.960]   Now, if we go back to American status, I was saying that the base level status, you need 40,000 loyalty
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.140]   points. The next level is 75,000. And the next level is 125. One of the things this card offers,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:11.580]   even without spending money on the card, is that after you earn 50,000 loyalty points with
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.020]   American, holding this card gives you an extra 10,000. And then again, after you hit 90,000
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:22.940]   loyalty points, you get another 10,000. So if you were going for American Platinum Pro status,
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:29.340]   you need 125,000 loyalty points. Just having this card, not even spending on it, would get you 20 of
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:36.460]   those 125,000 points. If you're going for Platinum status, you need 75. So you'd get 10 towards that and
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.980]   only need 65. So if you're really making a go for American status, this card is pretty interesting.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:48.380]   The only other perks that it has are World Elite MasterCard perks, which any World Elite MasterCard
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.100]   would have. There are some discounts and statuses with maybe some rental cars and stuff like that.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.260]   Nothing too compelling, but you can go search World Elite MasterCard and look at those perks.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:04.540]   So for this card, I think that if you travel American, getting lounge access potentially for up to four
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.660]   people is pretty compelling. So I'd put it at A tier. Obviously, if you don't fly American ever,
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:15.660]   all of these American cards are going to be D tier. But the last one I want to mention is probably my
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.940]   favorite and the one I recently got, which is the Advantage Business Platinum card. And the reason it's
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.740]   interesting might not be interesting every year and might only be interesting this year, but it has the
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.580]   highest signup bonus of all the cards right now. So that's interesting. 75,000 after spending 5K in
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:38.460]   five months. It also has a $99 annual fee, but the first year is free. So that's interesting.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.100]   You got no foreign transaction fees, which is interesting. And then on the benefits side,
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.860]   you get first bag free for up to four people. And then if you spend $30,000, you get a companion
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:55.580]   certificate, which is $99 plus taxes and fees for a companion. So out the gate, it is a similar price
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:03.660]   to the personal platinum card. But I think it's a lot better for two reasons. You do earn 2x on rental
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:10.700]   car and gas, but also 2x on telecom, cable and satellite. So if you're spending your bills on phone
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.460]   bills and cable bills, you can earn a little bit of extra American points. But the most interesting
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:22.700]   thing is as a business card, it has a couple unique features. So one thing that's very different about
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.220]   the way American business cards work than almost every other one is that if you add an authorized
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:35.100]   employee and that employee is using the card, the loyalty points accrue to the employee, not to the primary
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   cardholder. So if you want to earn status, you want to use the primary card. But the miles from both
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.700]   primary and authorized users all accrue to an advantage business account. And that advantage
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:52.620]   business account can choose who to transfer those miles to. So in effect, you get this new account that
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.180]   lets you dole out those miles to any of the employees or authorized users on the card. However,
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:03.340]   there is a promotion in 2025. And it says it's targeted, but I did never got an email about it.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.140]   And I see it in my promotions tab. And I've heard pretty much everyone has been targeted for this
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:14.220]   promotion. And it was also effective last year that all the authorized user or employee cards that are
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:20.300]   earning loyalty points for themselves, the primary cardholder will also get those loyalty points.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:29.260]   Meaning if you need to spend in America's platform $75,000 to earn platinum status, if you do it on the
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:35.980]   authorized employee card, then the primary user and the employee or authorized user get that status
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.900]   because they're both accruing the loyalty points. So if you and any other person are both gunning for
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:48.940]   American status, this card is excellent because it effectively lets you spend once and earn those
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:54.220]   loyalty points for two people. So I was a little torn on this. If you're going for American status,
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.260]   this card has to be S tier because it lets you earn status for two people at the same time.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.780]   But I still don't think the earnings is that exciting. And so, and not everyone's going for
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.740]   American status and not everyone wants a business card and not everyone is trying to get status for
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.540]   two people. Because if you are in a family and you're often traveling together, we don't really need
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.780]   the status for both of you. You're going to get free bags for four people. You're going to get preferred
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.580]   boarding. Your status will let others board with you. So I'm going to put this in a tier,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.940]   but I think that it's definitely the best of the American cards, unless you really rely on lounge
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:35.260]   access, which by the way, at some tier of milestone perks, meaning as you earn loyalty points, you get
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:42.060]   perks. One of those benefits is an admiral's club membership. So there is a way to spend your way to
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.780]   an admiral's club membership through loyalty points. It's going to be a lot more loyalty points,
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.460]   but it is an option without having that executive card. Okay. Next, I want to talk about the Costco
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:58.860]   cards. Um, I think they're really interesting because people seem to love them, but I just don't
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.740]   see it. I just don't get it for myself. I don't get it for almost anyone. They have no signup bonus.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.620]   They have no annual fee though. You do need a Costco membership. So in order to get the card,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.900]   you need to have a Costco membership, which does have an annual fee. And if you're going for the
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.860]   business card, the only real difference I can find between the personal and the business Costco cards
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.900]   is that if you have authorized users on the business card, they all need Costco membership.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.060]   So you can't just add any authorized user. You need to add an authorized user who already has
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.580]   their own Costco membership. They'll have no foreign transaction fee.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   The interesting thing must be for most people, the earnings potential.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:41.820]   They do 5% on Costco gas and 4% on gas and EV charging anywhere else, but that's only up to $7,000
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:48.300]   of spend a year. So if you figure, even if your best case alternative is a 2% on gas card,
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:55.500]   you're really only getting an extra about $210. And I think that was, uh, only if you spend the entire
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.540]   $7,000 on Costco gas, uh, if you spend it getting 4%, then you're only getting an extra 2%.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:06.220]   And like I mentioned earlier, the city strata premier card is going to get three X on gas.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:12.300]   The city custom cash card is going to get you five X on gas in transferable points, or that could be
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:18.620]   cash back up to $6,000 a year. So if you're getting this for gas, I would get the city custom cash.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:25.900]   You're, you're only missing out on an extra $1,000 of an extra, something like, you know,
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:34.460]   3% $30. So not worth it for me for gas. So what's another reason to get it could be 3% back on travel,
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.980]   except I can think of so many cards that are going to earn more than 3% on travel.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:44.940]   The city strata premier, the chase Sapphire reserve, the Amex green card, the chasing preferred card,
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.660]   the autograph and the autograph journey card, the Robin hood card. So 3% on travel is not a reason
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:55.260]   to get a card, especially one without a signup bonus. And then you get 2% at Costco. There are
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:01.980]   dozens of cards that get 2%, uh, on all your purchases. Um, I will say Costco does need a visa
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.860]   in store. So if you've got the city double cash, you wouldn't get 2% in store because it's a MasterCard
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:12.540]   though. You can, I believe you can still use a MasterCard online. Um, but the capital one venture card
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.420]   is, uh, great for in store. A lot of, I think the Robin hood cards, a visa card.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.140]   I know the smartly cards, a visa card. Um, there are some cards that pay elevated bonuses on mobile
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:28.380]   wallet. If you have platinum monitors with bank of America, you can get up to 2.6 to 5% cash back
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:34.540]   on a visa card. So a lot of cards I'd rather use at Costco that are not this card and then 1% on
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.300]   everything else. And on top of all of that, your cash back doesn't get paid out until your February
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:47.020]   statement. So make big purchases in March and all your cash back is, is kind of being held for another
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:53.020]   11 months before you actually see it. Only other thing, Costco did add purchase protection that is
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.660]   better than most of the other city cards here. So you get some damage and theft protection. And on the
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:03.100]   travel side, you get primary rental coverage, you get roadside assistance and accident insurance.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.780]   The accident insurance is particularly interesting. It's, it's $250,000 of coverage, but then they get
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:14.620]   very specific about how it pays out. So if you lose, uh, both your hands or both your feet,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.900]   you can get up to $250,000. But if you only lose one hand or one foot, they will only give you up to
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:26.540]   $125,000. If you only lose a thumb or an index finger, but it has to be in the same hand,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:32.060]   they'll give you 25% of the coverage, which is $62,500. And other things are on this list.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.020]   I just think it's funny that somebody went to the extent of saying, well,
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:40.220]   thumb and index finger on the same hand is worth 25%, but thumb and index finger on separate hands,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:44.860]   you get zero. I don't know how people come up with these things. Um, all in all, not excited
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:51.020]   about the Costco cards. Um, I want to put them in the D tier, but there's just so many worse cards
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.260]   that I'm going to put them in the C tier, but they're not cards I'll ever be getting, um,
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.900]   or using in any way, shape or form. The last card is an interesting one.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.500]   And it's a cult favorite in the points and miles. We're probably in the cashback world.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.820]   It's a little bit of a sleeper because if you look at it on the internet, you'll probably be saying,
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.700]   why is this card even interesting? So it's the city shop your way card.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:21.500]   And it is signup bonus is $225 in statement credits. It's one of the strangest signup bonuses.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:27.980]   You get $75 back after spending 500 up to three times in 90 days. So if you spend 1500,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   you'd get the full 225. It earns points, but these are not thank you points. Um, it earns 5% at gas,
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.820]   3% on groceries and restaurants, but only up to 10,000 a year on all those combined categories.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.620]   So not that exciting. There's a list of shop your way merchants where I think you are in
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:51.260]   two X or 2% back on those. And then 1% on everything else. It's not entirely clear what
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:56.300]   the points you're earning are worth. I've heard two reports that they're worth 1 cent or 0.85 cents.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:01.980]   Uh, but that's not the primary reason anyone wants this card. And you won't find the primary reason
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:09.420]   why anyone wants this card anywhere really on the website. Um, and, and they talk about maybe special
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:15.180]   offers somewhere, but I really don't even see it listed anywhere on this site. And by the way,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.980]   it has no annual fee. I didn't look, but I would be shocked if it didn't have foreign transaction fees
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:25.420]   because it doesn't seem like a travel focused card. So let's assume it has 3% foreign transaction fees,
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:33.100]   which it does. Um, and, and here's what happens. I've got a few examples from a few people who reported
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.860]   the thing that's interesting about this card is all the deals that it sends
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:44.060]   to you sometime in a three to four month window after having the card, but there's no guarantee you'll
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.620]   get them. But it seems pretty consistent that people three, four or five months into this card
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:54.380]   start getting very lucrative offers. So one person reported that the initial offers they got a few months
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:01.100]   into the card. They got three of them. One was 20% off a hundred dollars plus on utilities for three
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:08.140]   months in a row up to $75 back a month. So if you spent a full $375 each month in utilities,
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:16.460]   you'd get 75 back each month for $225. They got a 10% off $400 or more each month at gas stations,
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:23.180]   grocery stores, and restaurants combined with a max of 150 back. So if you spent $1,500 three months in a row,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:31.420]   you'd get 150 back each month for $450 total. And then last, they got $125 off spending 2000 a month
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:37.180]   on anything. And these, my understanding is these all stack. So if you've got 2000, spend 2000, get 125
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:45.180]   back and spend 400 plus on these four categories, you can combine them. And so that ends up being over
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   three months. Uh, you have three months to hit that spend. You end up getting $125 back on 2k of spend.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:04.620]   So in total for $5,625 of spend, they got $800 back, which is 14.2% back. Plus they got all the regular
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.780]   earning from the card, which for the most categories is just one X points. Uh, but maybe that bumps it up
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:17.420]   to 15% back and that's on 5,000 of spend. So a free $800 in a quarter. And I, and I say free,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:23.340]   obviously they had to do this spend. There was an opportunity cost of this spend, but 14% with,
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:30.700]   with the regular spending, maybe 15% back on, uh, five grand is not nothing. Another person got a bunch of
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:38.460]   offers in Q4, which was 50 off a thousand dollars online. It's about 5%. Another $200 off a thousand
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.180]   dollars online. And then another 75 off a thousand dollars online. And then they got
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:51.820]   two 50 off $2,000 on gas, grocery, and dining over three usable, each of three months, 40 off 400 in
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:58.940]   utility and 10% back on at least a hundred dollars a month on travel for two months. I'm not going to break
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:05.740]   them all down. The short version is on $12,200 to spend, they would have gotten $1,395 back,
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.420]   which is 11 and a half percent plus their regular earnings. So let's call it 12 and a half percent.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:17.900]   So in both these examples, 12 and a half to 15% back on, you know, five to $12,000 in a quarter,
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:24.620]   not bad. So a card to keep in your wallet, if, if those kinds of offers and that kind of earning is
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:30.460]   interesting to you, you know, you could have a almost signup bonus level amount of cash back.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.300]   Now, I don't know how often these offers come, but it seems like people are getting them every
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.780]   quarter. They're getting a whole set of them. So I have not used this card. I'd encourage you to go
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:44.460]   search online and do some research. But if a card could convince, conceivably offer you like a signup
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:50.620]   bonus every three or four months consistently on an ongoing basis based on your spending.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.660]   And you know, you're not gonna have to open up a new card for it. Yes, it doesn't have a huge signup
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.900]   bonus, but maybe it's earned a spot in your wallet. It's definitely an interesting card.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.300]   So I'm gonna put it in a tier because there's just not a card like it that I'm aware of.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:10.460]   And it's pretty lucrative. I've heard people say that they think that this card is like this sleeper
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.740]   secret card that maybe city forgot about and doesn't ever talk about, but is really lucrative after
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.180]   holding it for a while. So that's the shop your way card. I excluded a bunch of cards here. I didn't
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.980]   include cards that cities discontinued the prestige card, the rewards plus and the AT&T access more.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.220]   And then there's a bunch of retailer cards, like I mentioned, and then three city cards that they actually
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:35.260]   put at the top of their list. And by top, I mean in the upper half of their list of cards.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:40.060]   But they have no real benefit other than being balance transfer cards.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:45.820]   That's the diamond preferred, the simplicity and the diamond secured. All three of those cards
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:51.740]   offer zero benefits. And I mean, zero earning, not just one X everything, zero X everywhere.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.340]   Some of them offer balance transfer, low APR for balance transfers,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:00.540]   but have a three to 5% balance transfer fee. So I don't see a single reason to get any of these
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:05.820]   cards. All three of them D tier worst on the list. Not interesting. So I'll put a link to the photo
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.380]   of the tier list in the show notes for anyone who's not watching on video. As I mentioned, there are links
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.260]   to these cards on the website if you want them, but we don't earn anything from them. If for some reason,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:21.100]   I find that any all the hacks members happen to have, uh, referral links, I'll use those referral
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.900]   links on the websites links. Otherwise, you know, you could just go to city's website and find them.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:32.140]   Also speaking of all the hacks members, when I do this series for other issuers, I'll probably take
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:37.420]   Amex and chase and make those a member only episode. So if you want to see the deep dive on
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.980]   chase ultimate rewards, and you want to see the deep dive on Amex membership rewards, that's going to be
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:48.140]   a members only episode. They're just a bunch of things that, um, having those partnerships preclude me
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.620]   from talking about, uh, on the podcast and make it a little complicated. So I might write them up as a
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:57.500]   blog post as well and share it in email because that seems to be okay. But for now, they probably
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.700]   won't be in the podcast. So let's talk city rules. Cause there are a few rules here that as anyone who's
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.420]   now thinking, Oh, maybe I should get one of these cards you might want to know about. So one is that
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:13.820]   for any card on city, you can only get the welcome offer every 48 months for some cards. It's 24 months.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.460]   So look into the terms, but you can repeat welcome offers. You just need to wait two to
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:25.180]   four years to do it. Um, you can only get one city card every eight days. Um, but it's a little
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:31.660]   confusing because that is what everyone consistently says. Yet I signed up for the advantage business and
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.180]   the strata premiere on the same day. And then there's another rule that says you can only get
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:40.300]   two cards every 65 days. I think maybe because I applied for them at the, on the same day, um,
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.420]   maybe it got combined, but I'm certainly going to wait 65 days before I consider adding that double
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:52.300]   cash. Um, there's some rumors that it's really hard to get a city card. If you've had six hard
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.660]   inquiries on your credit in the last six months, but it's not a consistent rule. Shout out to frequent
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:03.580]   miler for sharing that. Um, and then also city, a couple nuances of city that are interesting.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.060]   You cannot move credit from one card to another. So a lot of times the, from when it comes to
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.820]   reconsideration, you could call up and say, Hey, could I move some credit between cards?
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.740]   You can't do that with city. And then last, one of the cool things about the city is that you can
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:21.580]   product change between cards across platforms. So on some platforms, the airline cards can't go
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:27.500]   to the hotel cards or the transferable points cards here. They can, but no one really understands
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.380]   the rules. So I saw lots of data points of people saying, well, I have the city mile up and I could
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:37.180]   transfer it to a double cash or a Costco card, but not the custom cash card. Uh, and then other
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.860]   people said, I have an American platinum card and I could go to double cash. Um,
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.340]   but I, or any other American card, other people said they couldn't go to the double cash card.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.860]   Another person said they couldn't go to the strata premiere, but another person said they could.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:55.500]   So after a year you can call city and potentially change your card to another card, but it's unclear
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:00.540]   which one of those cards is, is possible, but it seems pretty consistently that the double cash
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:06.220]   is often an option and that for AA cards, the AA and Costco cards are often an option.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:11.420]   And that, you know, who knows if the strata premiere, the custom cash will be an option.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.860]   This is all pretty recent historically getting a downgrade to the custom cash was really easy.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.220]   I want to dive into city thank you points because the reason that I'm excited about city aside from
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.860]   being able to earn American status for two players at the same time is really the thank you points
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.740]   ecosystem. And I'll share a lot about that. A few other quick things about city.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.380]   I have heard issues that people have said cities kind of a pain to deal with fraud.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.500]   I haven't had any of those issues. I've done a bunch of large random transactions, no issues.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:48.540]   So not a problem I've had getting virtual card numbers. I did get a virtual card number when
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.780]   I signed up for the AA card. So if you have some spend and you need to hit it quickly,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.020]   I was able to get a virtual card for the AA business card and use it right away.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.860]   But I didn't get one on the strata premiere.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:04.460]   Business and personal cards are separate logins, which is just kind of a pain.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   You can't product change business cards at all. Also, I didn't mention that earlier.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:13.180]   I do like some of the spending summary charts they have on the city website.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.820]   It's kind of better than most of the other cards I've used on other issuers.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.780]   With credit limits, I did not get very high credit limits. And I don't know if that's because I have
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:28.140]   a ton of outstanding credit amounts on other cards and they didn't want to give me more,
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.420]   or if it's because they're pretty stingy with credit, which I have heard.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:37.500]   I got $11,000 on the strata premiere and 16,000 on the city biz versus other cards.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.260]   I've gotten, you know, 20 to 30 K.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.900]   You can do an online credit line increase. My understanding is that you can only do it
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:50.860]   once every six months. So once it's been 180, you know, two or three days from your last card
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.260]   issuance with city, you can request an increase. And I know people have been able to drive up their
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:01.100]   credit lines to over $50,000 on a card, but they had to do it every six months. And you could do
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:06.460]   that without an additional heart inquiry, which is nice. This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.740]   Now, I love Element and I use it all the time because it helps anyone stay hydrated without
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:17.500]   the sugar and other dodgy ingredients in popular electrolyte and sports drinks. And that's important
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.140]   because electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue, brain fog,

[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.660]   So let's talk about city thank you points because they're really interesting. So first off, there's
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:30.300]   some bad ways to redeem them. If you redeem them as statement credits, you can get one cent. So it's not
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.780]   the worst, but I think transferable points are more valuable. But if you wanted to play this whole game
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:39.580]   with cash back, just assume every point is worth one penny. You can get one penny as a statement credit,
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:44.620]   or you can get one penny in the travel portal, or you can get one penny buying gift cards and some
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.780]   merchandise. But at the end of the day, I would always encourage you for the same rate of return,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.420]   get the cash, get the statement credit, pay off your balance, and then use the money saved and
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:58.540]   go buy travel with the airlines directly. Earn points on that travel by using the city premier
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.220]   card. Go buy gift cards somewhere else, go buy merchandise somewhere else. So I would not use my
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.020]   city thank you points for anything other than statement credits, or what I think is the best use,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:16.140]   which is transferring them to airlines and hotels. So city has 23 transfer partners right now, 18
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:22.060]   airlines and five hotels. Like I mentioned earlier, you do need the city premier or the prestige card,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.940]   historical card to transfer points to airlines. But when you do, there's a lot of great options.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:31.580]   And so on the airline side, I said, there's 18. The biggest one I'll highlight is Eva air,
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:36.780]   which is an airline based in Taiwan. And they make a ton of award availability,
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.780]   especially in premium cabins available to their members. So having access to Eva air availability
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:48.620]   is a really great way to unlock low cost international business with good availability
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:55.100]   to Asia. And while Capital One is the only other transfer partner that has Eva air, Capital One,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:45:01.820]   you need five Capital One points to get four Eva air points. So it's 1.25 to one. And with city,
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:07.740]   you get one to one. So Eva air is a real standout if you have other points ecosystems to pull from.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:14.780]   But if you don't, and you're just looking broadly at what is city have, they've got almost all the
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:20.540]   obvious airlines, they've got flying blue with Air France and KLM, they've got Avianca, Cathay Pacific
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:28.380]   Asia miles, Qantas, Singapore, Turkish Virgin, and a few others. Notably, they don't have any US airlines except
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:34.460]   jet blue. Now, for me, that doesn't matter, because I know I can use Avianca to book Star
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:40.860]   Alliance United, I can use flying blue to book Delta, though, I'm often not using points for Delta. And
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.020]   it's a little bit of a harder game. I will say if you're trying to use your points to book a lot of
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.260]   one world flights on American, it's going to be a little trickier, you know, you could use Qantas,
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:54.060]   this, but it's hard. And by the way, if you go to all the hacks.com slash TP, you can or in the show
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.380]   notes, there's a spreadsheet I put together of all the different transfer partners, I kind of try to
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.540]   highlight and compare them against all of the different programs. And so on the on the airline
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.940]   side, the really standout one is is Eva air, there is also Thai air, which only city is a partner of
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:15.980]   two things. One, I believe those transfers take three to seven days. And two, I haven't found a
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:21.740]   single redemption worth using Thai airways for. So cool that they have a unique partner, but not
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.540]   really cool, because it's not useful. On the hotel side is where I think city really shines. And that's
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:32.220]   honestly, the reason that I wanted to get into cities program was hotels and and the Eva air availability.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:39.900]   Notably, city gets choice choice hotels, which is also part of Amex also part of cap one, but you get
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:45.180]   a one to two ratio instead of on those programs, you get a one to one. So twice as many choice points.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:50.700]   Wells Fargo rewards similarly has a one to two choice points. I'll brush on Wells Fargo in a little bit.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:58.460]   But that's interesting. Choice hotels, the access to some preferred hotels, which are some nice luxury
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.820]   hotels is interesting. There are also a ton of choice hotels, they don't have the most luxurious
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:09.020]   portfolio, there are some really nice Radisson blues, Cambria's ascends. But for the most part,
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:14.300]   I would say compared to other hotel chains, this the shining star of choice is not hotels, if you're
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:20.300]   looking to stay in really luxury properties. But if you are city also has preferred hotels and leading
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:25.980]   hotels of the world. And those two transfer rate partners are unique to city, no one else has them,
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:31.900]   which is really exciting. And so the ability to book hotels and luxury hotels is really nice. They also
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.540]   have Wyndham and Accor. And so the best hotel bookings here to get the most value out of your
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:42.140]   city points. If you book preferred hotels, either through preferred hotels or by transferring to choice,
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:51.020]   you can get a really good value like up to 0.71 cent per point on choice, which going one to two means
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:57.420]   1.4 to 2 cents of value for transfers to choice. So if your city points are getting 1.4 to 2 cents,
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:05.980]   that's really good value. On Vacasa, booking through Wyndham, you can get up to about 1.6 cents of value
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:12.700]   from your city points. And for people not familiar, the way Vacasa works is Vacasa is a vacation rental
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:22.220]   platform. They have tons of properties all over the world. And it's 15,000 Wyndham points to book a Vacasa
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:29.580]   per bedroom up to places that charge $250 per bedroom. So if you're looking at a three bedroom place,
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:36.700]   if it's $750 a night or less, you can book it for 15,000 points per bedroom per night. And if it's
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:43.260]   $500 per bedroom per night or less, you can book it for 30,000 points. Let's say a two bedroom that's
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.220]   under $1,000 a night, you could book for 30,000 points per bedroom per night or 60,000 points a
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.860]   night. A little complicated. I'll leave a link in the show notes to Wyndham Vacasa bookings,
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.500]   but good way to get value out of city points. Wyndham is also a transfer partner of Capital One,
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.780]   so a good way to get value out of Capital One points. And then for leading hotels,
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.500]   those points are worth about eight cents each. The transfer ratio is five city points to one
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.460]   leaders club point. So you end up getting about 1.6 cents. A lot of the perks you get from hotel
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.580]   programs booked through travel agencies like fine hotels and resorts or the all the hacks hotel upgrade
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:22.380]   program, you get upgrade breakfast, early, late check-in and check-out. When it comes to
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:30.220]   transferring to partners, city does have a lot of transfer bonuses. I looked in 2023 and 2024,
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:38.940]   there were 13 and 15 each. So far we've had three in 2025. For the most part, it looks like every
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:45.180]   year there's been one Cathay Pacific, Air France, Virgin Atlantic, Accor and Wyndham transfer bonus,
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.620]   at least over the last two years. Last year, there was also a Turkish leading hotels and Etihad
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:56.700]   transfer bonus. And for the most part, all the transfer bonuses end up being 20 to 35%.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:01.740]   Anytime they've done a core, it's been a 50% bonus. And anytime they've done Cathay Pacific,
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.900]   it's 10 to 15%. But all the rest of them are pretty much between 20 and 35%.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.620]   So there are opportunities to take your points even further by waiting for windows in which you have
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:16.300]   transfer bonuses. I think as of recording right now, there is a transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:23.420]   for a 30% bonus until May 17th. So I think you're going to get the most value out of thank you points
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:29.740]   transferring to airlines, as is true for all points and miles. But notably, unlike a lot of other programs,
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:34.300]   there's a lot of opportunity for hotels here, especially choice to book preferred preferred
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:39.020]   to book preferred and leading hotels for luxury hotels that you don't get in any other program,
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:44.460]   at least at those ratios. Finally, one last great thing about Citi is that you can transfer points to
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:50.540]   anyone else. However, when you transfer points, there is a limit, you can only transfer up to 100,000 points,
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:57.100]   someone can only receive 100,000 points, and those points expire after 90 days. But if you wanted to
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:02.380]   combine points and book one vacation out of one person's account, or one person has earned status,
[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:07.660]   you could add 100,000 points from your account and they can transfer them to their transfer partners.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:12.940]   And that give you a little bit easier ability to do that. There are mixed reports. Some people are
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.820]   saying that you can transfer from your Citi account to the loyalty program of an authorized user. Some are
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.380]   saying you can't, I'm not sure. And also you can transfer your points, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.740]   between cards. So even though the Citi double cash card can't transfer to airlines and hotels,
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.620]   the Strata Premier can and you can transfer your points from your double cash to your Strata Premier.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:38.220]   The only weird edge case here is that all your points, even if you've moved them,
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:42.940]   are still somehow on the back end tied to the card they were earned on. And so let's say you had
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:48.380]   100,000 points you earned on your Citi double cash card and 10,000 you earned on your Strata Premier
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:53.260]   card and you moved them all over. Now you've got 110,000 in your Strata Premier. If you close your
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:52:00.380]   double cash card, 60 days later, those points are expired. And so even though they might be living in
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:06.780]   in the Strata Premier system right now, they will still expire after 60 days. So general advice is
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:12.380]   until you have zero points, if you've ever merged or moved points around, I would say just downgrade
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:18.460]   whatever card you want to cancel to a free card, because it's not not a not a real problem if you
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.980]   have a card and you just leave it open. So that's Citi thank you points. Let me talk about at a high
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:29.660]   level, what I think is the summary of Citi. What is exciting about Citi? The most exciting few things
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.060]   are, look, if you care about American status or lounge access, Citi is really the only place to go.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:40.140]   And then if you want to diversify beyond Chase and Amex, there's a lot of interesting reasons to do that.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:46.940]   Like I mentioned, Eva Air, one to one ratio is the only place you can get it. Turkish has some good
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:52.140]   sweet spots, not as many as they used to. Turkish is not on Chase and Amex. And then Cathay,
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:58.300]   Qantas and Etihad are all not on Chase as well. So you get some new options on the hotels front,
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.860]   you get choice at one to two leading hotels in the world and preferred, which are also not Chase and
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.980]   Amex. So a lot of good options, at least choice at that transfer ratio is not, but a lot of good hotel
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:15.820]   options. On the earning side, I was really surprised to see what I'm going to share. So I used the
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:21.900]   credit card optimizer tool I built, and there's a link to it on the website. And I went in and I used
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:27.580]   Bureau of Labor Statistics standard earning data for a household earning, I think, over $100,000.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:35.100]   And just said, what if people had the best two card combo from all major issuers? What would their
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:44.700]   average points earning ratio be? So worst in the pack is actually Chase. So that's primarily because the
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.740]   best everything else card is the Freedom Unlimited, which only earns one and a half points.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.380]   And so with Chase, the best combo would be the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:54:00.540]   you'd get 3x travel dining, one and a half x everything else for a total annual fees of $550.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:07.840]   But the average earning there is 1.91x points. So you're not even getting an average of 2x points, which
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.440]   obviously, if you're doing City getting your second card as the double cash, the floor is 2x points.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.520]   So not great. If you went to the Sapphire Preferred instead of the Sapphire Reserve,
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:23.840]   you'd be getting 1.79x on everything. Obviously, your own spending affects this. If you want to go use
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:30.880]   the tool I built, you can put in your own spending and see. But Chase is really low in the pack. Worst
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:38.960]   worst here when it comes to a two card combo. Next is Amex. I guess the best Amex two card combo,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:45.600]   if you're not talking business cards, would be the Amex Gold and the Amex Green. You'd get travel,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:54.080]   transit, dining, and groceries. And you'd get a $400 of annual fees. And your earning average rate would be
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:55:00.200]   1.96. Now, if you replace the Amex Green with the Blue Business Plus, which earns 2x points on up to
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:06.840]   $50,000 a year with no annual fee, you'd have a much higher earning rate of 2.37. But again,
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:13.680]   that's using the BLS data. If I use my own spending, which that everything else category goes over $50,000
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:19.620]   a year, it really starts to weigh that average down because then you're earning 1x on everything else.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.100]   Amex is really a bad platform for the everything else category because they don't have a card that
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:29.400]   earns 1.5x unlimited or 2x unlimited on the everything category.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.260]   So then you come to the three real contenders for a two card combo in one ecosystem.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:42.860]   You've got Capital One with the Venture Card and the Saver Card. So $95 of annual fees,
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:50.720]   2.26 earning on everything. With the Saver, you get 3x dining, groceries, streaming, and entertainment.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:57.680]   And you've got very similar transfer partners actually to Citi. So Citi has a better, you get
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:04.000]   JetBlue, you get EVA 1 to 1, you get Choice at 1 to 2 instead of 1 to 1 and some other hotel stuff.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.780]   And then Capital One has Tap Portugal, which is a pretty matte airline to redeem points on.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:17.120]   So I'd say comparing these two, Citi's at the top of the pack, 2.33x with the Strata Premier and the Double Cash.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.240]   Just to recap, Strata Premier is getting 3x on dining, gas, grocery, hotels, and flights on a $95 annual fee.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.980]   So 2.33x on everything. Now, the other card that's really close behind, and when I say really close,
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:36.160]   the Citi average for a two card combo was 2.33x and the Wells Fargo average was 2.32x.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:45.320]   So 0.01% less in terms of points. And that is the Wells Fargo autograph card paired with the Wells Fargo
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:50.580]   active cash card. Now, it has $0 annual fee. So maybe you could say that takes the cake.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:56.980]   And the autograph card is doing 3x on dining, travel, transit, gas, streaming, and cell phones.
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:03.080]   So pretty compelling alternative to the Citi Premier card. What you miss there is you don't get the
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:08.660]   grocery spend. But the thing I don't love about Wells Fargo is they have a much, much more limited
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.720]   set of transfer partners. They've only got five airlines that you can transfer to.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:19.000]   And on the hotel front, they only have one hotel program. So they do have choice at one to two,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.260]   which is nice, but that's it. So you're just really, really limited with Wells Fargo.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.780]   And I think everyone thought when Wells Fargo launched all these transfer partners,
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:31.140]   that there would be a ton of options that were getting added and added month and month after month.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.900]   But unfortunately, it turns out they were not added month and month after month.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.120]   And they really haven't added a ton of transfer partners. So I think Wells Fargo is an interesting
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:44.420]   earning rate. The cards are compelling, but I think the program just isn't where the Citi program is.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.340]   So at the end of the day, if you want a two card combo and you want it from one issuer,
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:53.160]   I think the Citi Premier and the double cash from an earning standpoint is the best option out there.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.740]   I went in and replaced the BLS spending with my spending data and it was still the best card out
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:05.620]   there compared to all the others. So really, really impressive combo that I do not have both of yet.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:12.640]   I don't have the double cash. Where I think that Citi is less exciting is that it's just really hard to
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:18.260]   get these points. There are not tons of cards all the time with massive signup bonuses and upgrade
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:23.220]   bonuses. And you can't get a bunch of different business cards and accrue tons of points.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:28.360]   So for me right now, I want to get the double cash card and add it to the list so I can start
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.440]   building up enough Citi points that those EVA air and hotel bookings are possible.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.760]   But it is hard, right? I'm three months into this with a 75,000 point signup bonus and I don't think
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:43.800]   I've cracked 100,000 points yet. So it's really hard to get Citi points. They also don't have a
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:48.680]   refer a friend program. They also don't have points that you get from a shopping portal. So that's hard
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:53.540]   and they have lower limits. Even if I maxed my Citi Strata Premier card out every single month of the
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:59.480]   year, I would barely earn 100,000 points because the limit is so low. Hopefully, I can get that up over
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.020]   time. But just throwing it out there that that's one of the reasons to not be excited about Citi.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:10.520]   The only thing I didn't mention, which I'll just jump back to quickly, is like Chase and Amex and Bank
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.000]   of America, Citi does have merchant offers. I thought I'd do a quick run through of them.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.140]   I have them pulled up on my screen. One cool thing is I'm looking right now. Similarly, they work with
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:27.480]   card pointers. So whenever I open the Citi page, card pointers, auto ads, all of these offers to my cards.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.840]   If you haven't used card pointers, I've saved hundreds of dollars by having these offers auto
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.240]   added. Definitely worth checking them out. It's also a great way to just pull up on your phone and say,
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.720]   Hey, do I have any card offers? At Lyft, JetBlue, whatever retailer you're going to, or even a
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:49.300]   restaurant, you might be surprised. So love that. I think you can get 30% off at allthehacks.com
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:55.120]   slash card pointers, 50% off for members, all the Hacks members. And it's really interesting.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:59.440]   So if I look at the offers, they're not as compelling as what you get with Chase and Amex,
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.580]   but there were some that I thought are worth mentioning. You know, they had an offer for Lyft,
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:10.900]   $5 off $25 spend, $25 off $250 of JetBlue, $50 off $150 at Trust & Will.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.800]   An interesting one was 4% back at Giant, the grocery store. We don't have them in the Bay
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.680]   Area, but you could do it up to 10 times for up to $30. But some of them are really, really tiny
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:31.040]   offers. So Walmart, 4% back up to $3. I saw one for 8% back on my FICO. I was kind of disappointed
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.340]   because I paid for that and I didn't use an offer. I don't think I had gotten the card yet,
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:41.880]   but still. And then last, there was one for Dropbox, 20% off $100 plus purchase at Dropbox,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.900]   which I will likely use because I think my Dropbox plan renews.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:50.640]   They did have a bunch of local restaurants, like five to 10, five or six restaurants that we actually
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.900]   go to that are local where we live in our Bay Area suburb in town. Most of them were all offering
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:00.700]   6% back. Obviously, they're probably partnered with some other platform to do this because I just
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.720]   don't think that Citi is making deals with all these small restaurants. But at the end of the
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.400]   day, there's 315 offers on my account. And almost all of them except the ones I mentioned are pretty
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:18.960]   low 1% to 10% back with caps. None of the massive crazy offers that I've seen with Citi and Amex lately.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.080]   So good that they have them. Good to get them all added. Good to know where they are,
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   but probably not going to add a huge amount of earning. So that's my end. I'm really excited to be
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.160]   in the Citi ecosystem. I'm excited to do this episode because I think there's a lot of opportunity
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.840]   here. Even if you want to just go cash back, the combo of Citi Strata Premier and Double Cash,
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:44.860]   using those for cash back is a pretty compelling option as well. So if you like this, if you don't
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:52.400]   like this, would love feedback. Podcast at allthehacks.com is the email. Expect another one of these on each
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.600]   program. I'm probably going to focus on the ones first that are less well-known. Things like Bank of
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.560]   America and Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank that we haven't dove into as much, though most of the
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   exciting U.S. Bank cards are no longer available or have been knocked down a bit. So maybe we'll skip
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.120]   that. And then I'm going to do everything I can to try to put the Chase and Amex one out on the main
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.120]   feed. But I think realistically, it's going to be tough. So if you want those, definitely check out
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:24.140]   the member site, allthehacks.com slash join. We'll do the Chase and Amex ones there. And that's it for
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.940]   this week. So I will see you next week.
