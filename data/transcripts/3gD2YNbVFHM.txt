[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Thanks for listening to another week
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.880]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.520]   as we close out the week here.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.960]   We get a lot of really good questions via email
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.880]   and of course you can send those questions to me
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.000]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.120]   And a number of those email questions have come in
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.780]   on the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.960]   Pastor John, I'll just put this topic out there for now.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.840]   I mean, talk to us about the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.720]   What can we learn from it?
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.280]   And what have you learned from it?
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.600]   - One of the main things to learn
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.400]   from the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.340]   is the need to distinguish between one,
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.160]   the plain truth of the slogan,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.440]   two, the ideological nature of its origin,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880]   and three, the strategies of action
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.940]   that it unleashes on the street.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.060]   We need to distinguish those when we talk about this.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.940]   Now you would think after wrestling with these things
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.940]   for 40 years, these ethnic, racial, social dynamics,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.880]   after 40 years that this would be more obvious to me,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.220]   those distinctions, but they weren't.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220]   I had to be corrected.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.440]   So another thing to learn besides those distinctions
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.800]   is no matter how long you've been at this, like me,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   no matter how long you've been at this,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.160]   thinking about the issue, talking about it,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.320]   writing about it, you can easily fall
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   into unhelpful ways of thinking or talking,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.360]   which is why ongoing friendships
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.500]   across ethnic lines is important.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400]   Conversations embedded in friendships
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.720]   is ongoingly important.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.160]   So let me tell a story now just to illustrate my blowing it
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   and the lessons, those two lessons that emerged from it.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.940]   Last year, 2015, there were widespread protests
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.400]   under the banner of Black Lives Matter,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.700]   largely because of some high profile cases
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   in which police killed unarmed black men.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.240]   Good question, whether it was warranted or not.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.520]   And that's of course the tip of the iceberg
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.840]   because there were about 100 of those
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.940]   and most of them were not high profile in 2015.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.760]   I saw a statistic that there were 102 unarmed black men
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   killed by police and that compares in its rate
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.520]   to a rate five times larger
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.360]   than the killing of unarmed whites.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   So you can get a feel for why there might be some concern
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.200]   and the emergence of something like Black Lives Matter.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.480]   And as I was watching all of this happen,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.260]   I wondered what to think about it, what to say about it.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.260]   And I Googled and found, oh, there's a website
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.440]   called blacklivesmatter.com.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.280]   And I read it and oh my goodness, it was awful.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   I mean, I didn't like it because it featured three women
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   who claimed to be the founders of Black Lives Matter,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.840]   Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, Patrice Cullors,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.200]   and they self-identify as quote, clear queer,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   not clear, queer black women.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And in big bold banners on their, her story,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.000]   not history, her story page,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   they say that they are queer affirming
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.980]   and transgender affirming.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.040]   Well, this did not excite me as of course it wouldn't
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   most of my Christian black brothers and sisters.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   And I was so surprised I tweeted this link
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.680]   so that people could be aware of these roots.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.280]   Well, a few weeks later, I was in Louisville
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.120]   with the Together for the Gospel team,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   which included Thabiti Anyabwile.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.800]   And if you don't know Thabiti,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.360]   he's a black pastor in Washington, DC.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   And he is, as everyone who knows him realizes,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.960]   intellectually, theologically, culturally,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.080]   highly intelligent, highly articulated,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.840]   highly courageous, highly level-headed,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.720]   and not a pushover.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.780]   And he let me know clearly that I wasn't helpful.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.100]   That kind of thing, unqualified, no context,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.360]   was in the give and take we were having around the table.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.000]   We did it for two, three days, great friendships there,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.960]   a lot of blunt in your face talk at that meeting.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.240]   And he helped me see, for the mass of ordinary folks,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.840]   black folks in particular, that website is a non-issue.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.680]   It doesn't even exist.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.000]   They don't even know it's there.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.600]   It's not driving anything.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.720]   And therefore, my call now, my learning afresh
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.100]   of needing to make distinctions between,
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.100]   one, a patently true slogan, Black Lives Matter,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.920]   and two, ideological roots of a name
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   that may be the real roots, or they may have been co-opted.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.360]   I mean, the name may have been co-opted.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.860]   So there's a double point here for my learning,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.560]   and I hope for all of us who are listening to grow in.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   First, we need ongoing regular conversations
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.600]   in the context of friendship across ethnic lines,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.900]   because otherwise, we will see things in a certain way,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.820]   say things in a certain way that may be naive at best
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.780]   and hurtful at worst.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.520]   The best way to be discerning in regard
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.720]   to the complexities of racial matters
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.440]   is to be in regular, normal, not exceptional,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.480]   normal conversations across ethnic lines
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   so that we see through other eyes.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.740]   And the other lesson is that we should distinguish.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.660]   We learn from these conversations
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.360]   to distinguish the plain truth of the slogan,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.320]   the ideological nature of its art,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.440]   the strategies of action that may or may not
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   always be the best.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.160]   Patently, Black Lives Matter, that's true.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.520]   And before, it's another little lesson maybe,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.320]   I'm just sticking this in.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.840]   Before we say anything like, "All lives matter,"
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.720]   before we say that, we need to pause.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   Because if you quickly add that, it sounds like a rebuke.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.480]   It sounds like a minimizing of what was just said.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.960]   It sounds like the point that was trying to be made
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.240]   isn't worth being made.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.360]   So you don't wanna make that point.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.400]   You don't want to say that.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   So you'd learn that pretty quickly in that conversation
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   if you added, "All lives matter."
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.160]   Of course that's true, all lives matter.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.940]   But oh, how timing matters and how context matters.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.280]   Let me give one more illustration of this friendship issue.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   I have been meeting about once a month
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.920]   with a pastor friend, a Black pastor friend
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.440]   in the Twin Cities.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.080]   And we have talked about over the last months
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.920]   the case of Jamar Clark here,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.680]   who was killed by the police last November,
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.680]   November, 2015 in the Twin Cities here, unarmed.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.160]   And I have learned things in this conversation
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.960]   with my friend that I would have just never,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   ever been aware of.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.320]   I've learned things about the sorrows
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.040]   of the Black community here in the Twin Cities
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.240]   that I would have never felt without this friendship.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.160]   Everything would have been seen from a distance,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.680]   seen through political or ideological eyes.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.160]   But oh, what a difference to listen
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.280]   to the sorrows of a man pushing 60
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.160]   who's been at this business for a long time
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   in his community and to hear him unpack the depths
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.880]   of things that cannot be bought or sold,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.920]   that can only be received in trust and friendship.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.880]   So those are my two or three lessons
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.800]   that I offer to everyone from my blowing it
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.960]   for your consideration.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.720]   Enjoy some close friendships across ethnic lines
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.880]   and be sure to make distinctions between true slogans
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.640]   like Black Lives Matter and questionable roots
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.120]   and strategic applications.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.640]   They're not all the same
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.600]   and many things need to be said about each one.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.400]   - That's so good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.240]   Well, 34,000 people follow Thabiti on Twitter
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.120]   and so should you.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.000]   Go to Twitter and search for Thabiti, T-H-A-B-I-T-I
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   and you'll find him.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.360]   Grateful to God for Thabiti's life and ministry.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.800]   Well, we're gonna break for the weekend now
