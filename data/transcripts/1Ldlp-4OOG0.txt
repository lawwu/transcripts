[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - A listener to the podcast, Peter from Seattle,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.560]   writes in, "Pastor John, what is the main difference
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.720]   "between Calvinism and Arminianism?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.000]   "I'm trying to explain this to my 13-year-old son
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.400]   "and would love to boil it down
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.140]   "to one or two watershed differences.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.380]   "What would those be?"
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.280]   - Okay, I am going to give him more than he asked for
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.780]   and then I'm gonna give him what he asked for, okay?
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.320]   I think it will be helpful for me to just walk through
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.680]   the so-called five points, because these five points
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.560]   are what the Arminian remonstrance in 1610
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.960]   threw back at the Calvinists.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.720]   The Calvinists didn't come up with five points
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.900]   to start with.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200]   The Calvinists wrote their vision of what salvation
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.920]   looks like and how it happens under God's sovereignty
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.120]   and when the Arminians read that, they said,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.900]   "These are five places we don't agree
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.640]   "and that's where we've gotten these five points."
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.920]   So if you wanna talk about what's the key
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.440]   soteriological differences between Arminianism, Calvinism,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.000]   you gotta take these one by one.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.120]   So here's what I'll do.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.240]   I'll just give one sentence for each Calvinism
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.560]   and Arminianism under the five points
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.260]   and then I'll say what I would say to my 13-year-old.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.840]   Depravity.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   Calvinism says people are so depraved and rebellious
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.660]   that they are unable to trust God
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.880]   without his special work of grace to change their hearts
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   so that they necessarily and willingly, freely believe.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520]   Arminians say, with regard to depravity,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.900]   people are depraved and corrupt,
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.900]   but are able to provide the decisive impulse
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.880]   to trust God with the general divine assistance
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   that God gives to everybody.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.800]   Election, number two.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.220]   Calvinism says that we are chosen,
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.120]   God chooses unconditionally,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   whom he will mercifully bring to faith and salvation
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   and whom he will justly leave in their rebellion.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.620]   Arminians say God has chosen us, elected,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.620]   to bring to salvation all those whom he foresaw
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.760]   would believe by bringing about their own faith,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.260]   providing the decisive impetus themselves.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.760]   In other words, God doesn't decisively produce the faith
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.900]   that he foresees.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   Third, atonement.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.480]   Calvinism says in the death of Christ,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.340]   God provided sufficient atonement for all,
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.340]   but designed that it be effective for the elect,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.980]   meaning that it purchased for them
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.800]   the new covenant promise that God would bring about
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.940]   in his people, faith and perseverance.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.260]   Arminians say in the death of Christ,
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.540]   God provided a sufficient atonement for all
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.400]   and designed that it would become effective
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.060]   by virtue of faith for which we, not Christ,
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420]   provide the decisive impetus,
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.420]   meaning that the faith itself is not purchased by the cross,
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.300]   but it's the human means of obtaining
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.380]   what the cross purchased, namely forgiveness of sins.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.640]   Fourth, grace or new birth.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.700]   Calvinists say that the new birth
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.620]   is God's work of renewal in our hearts,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.540]   which necessarily brings about the act of willing,
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.140]   hearty, saving faith.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.480]   Arminians say the new birth is God's work of renewal
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   in our hearts in response to our act of saving faith.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.180]   And fifth, perseverance.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.820]   Calvinists say God works infallibly
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.820]   to preserve us in faith, all of us who are truly born again
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.820]   and that no one is ever lost who was truly born of God.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.220]   Arminians say God works to preserve his people,
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.240]   but does not always prevent some who were born again
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.580]   from falling away to destruction.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.580]   So what's the one thing a dad would say to a son?
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.740]   'Cause those are all heavy,
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.620]   those words are carefully chosen,
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.940]   that would be hard to get,
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.460]   and they might need years to work through that.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.400]   And there is a, I did a seminar on the five points.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.820]   I think it's at the website that people could see.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.340]   But let me ask, close with the question,
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.260]   trying to answer the question that the dad asked.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.540]   I'd like to say that the one key difference
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.860]   is the sovereignty of God, but that won't work
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.940]   because the Arminians won't like that
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.780]   because they affirm the sovereignty of God too
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.100]   and just mean something a little more limited by it.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.420]   So here's what I would say to my 13-year-old.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.420]   I would say the key difference is how we get saved.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.340]   The key difference between a Calvinist and an Arminian
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   is how they understand how we get saved.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.420]   That is how we move from a condition of spiritual unbelief
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.740]   to a condition of heartfelt belief or faith in Christ.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.260]   And the key difference is this.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.300]   Calvinists believe that God has to produce in us
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.000]   the decisive desire for Christ.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And Arminians believe we must produce in ourselves
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.480]   the decisive desire for Christ.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.240]   The Arminians say that God helps us.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.880]   He helps all people.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   But we provide the last decisive impetus
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.160]   and desire for that belief.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   Or I might say it like this.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.840]   You can tell if someone is an Arminian or a Calvinist
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.260]   by how they answer the question,
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.120]   what was the decisive cause of your faith in Christ?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.080]   So you go up to somebody and say,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.520]   what was the decisive cause of your faith in Christ?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.000]   Was it God or was it yourself?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.640]   And the Calvinist says,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.720]   the decisive cause of my faith was God
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.160]   and the Arminian says,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   the decisive cause of my faith in Christ is myself.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   Very good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.040]   This is just a brief summary.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   If you or someone you love wants more details on Calvinism,
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   see John Piper's excellent book,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.620]   Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace,
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.040]   which you can download right now free of charge
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.400]   in its entirety at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.720]   Again, you're looking for the book Five Points,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   five is spelled out, F-I-V-E, Five Points.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.200]   And like Peter, if you wanna send Pastor John your question,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.020]   a very carefully crafted, concise, and specific question,
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.300]   go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.200]   Tomorrow, Pastor John will explain the differences
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.480]   between loving God and obeying God.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.120]   Or is there a difference at all?
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.000]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.160]   (silence)
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.320]   (silence)
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   (silence)
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
