[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this afternoon are to be found in
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.360]   the 32nd verse in that fifth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, a portion
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760]   of which has been read to us.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.800]   But let me read this short paragraph that runs from verse 29 to the end of verse 32.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.200]   When Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We ought to obey God rather than
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   men," the God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, for to give repentance
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.120]   to Israel and forgiveness of sins; and we are his witnesses of these things.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   I want to deal with that last verse, verse 32.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.640]   And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.160]   given to them that obey him.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.140]   We have here, of course, one of the first persecutions suffered and endured by the infant
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140]   Christian church.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.060]   Prior to this, two of the apostles, Peter and John, had been arrested and had been put
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.040]   on trial, as we can read in the fourth chapter of this book.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.280]   But here at this stage, the entire company of apostles had been arrested, and they had
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.960]   been thrown into prison.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.120]   This was because of the miracles that they were working, and because of their teaching.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.120]   But as you remember from the account, they had escaped from prison in a miraculous manner,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.200]   and they were back again in the temp of doing what they had been prohibited to do, namely
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   to preach the gospel.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.200]   But the authorities, the authorities who constituted this great council in Jerusalem, known as
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.920]   the Sanhedrin, they sent their troops again to arrest the apostles, and here they are.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   They are brought once more before the council.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.240]   And the charge against them is, "Did not we straightly commend you that you should not
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.020]   teach in this name?
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.920]   And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.660]   blood upon us."
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.560]   And then Peter answers for the entire company of the apostles in these words that I've just
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.840]   read to you again.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   In other words, what we have here is the Christian church fighting for her life.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.440]   The Christian church, questioned, queried, attacked, condemned, persecuted by the world.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.180]   And here she is, fighting for her message and her truth, fighting for her very existence.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.780]   And this is of importance to us, obviously, because it is clear that again we are returning
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.100]   more and more to conditions comparable to those which obtained during these early days
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.860]   of the Christian church.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.020]   The church is once more fighting for her life.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.140]   There's no question about this; statistics demonstrate it and prove it.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.220]   And we're all familiar, alas, with the sad declension in the religious life of this country,
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.020]   especially since the last world war.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.060]   And there are those who are prophesying and predicting the end of Christianity.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.660]   Certainly, they say the end of Christianity as we have known it.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.620]   And we're in a deteriorating situation.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.900]   So there is nothing that is more important for those of us who are concerned about these
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.540]   things, all of us who are Christian and who know that there is no other hope for all the
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.660]   multiplying problems of humanity, no hope whatsoever, apart from this gospel.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.100]   So nothing should be of greater concern to us than to know how we are to conduct and
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.900]   to comport ourselves at a time such as this, with all we stand for being attacked so powerfully
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.140]   in almost every direction.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.820]   What can we do?
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.140]   What's our duty at a time such as this?
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.540]   Well, I'm calling your attention to this incident because it seems to me that here is the perfect
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.260]   pattern and the perfect example.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.780]   Let's forget that we're living in 1978.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.660]   That's one of the most irrelevant factors of all.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.780]   The 20th century doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.220]   The church was fighting for her life in the first century and has had to do so many and
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.940]   many a time in her long, checkered history.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.860]   So there's nothing new about the position which we are confronting.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.460]   That is the basic fallacy, to think that we are confronting with a new situation that
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.980]   nobody's ever known before.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.980]   It's sheer nonsense.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.820]   If we had nothing but this one paragraph, we have a sufficient answer to this foolish
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:36.180]   notion that because we are 20th century people, we have a novel situation and we need some
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.940]   new answers to our problems.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940]   No, no.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.340]   In this respect, as in so many others, there is nothing new under the sun.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.060]   So the essence of wisdom, as I say, is to go back to the history.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.220]   There's no need to try and discover some new message or some new method.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.980]   Let's find out how the church succeeded at the very beginning.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.900]   And you'll find in, if you read the subsequent history of the church, that the same has happened
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.100]   on many and many an occasion.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.140]   There have been dark eras in the history of the church.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.860]   There have been periods when the gospel was virtually obliterated, hidden entirely out
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.940]   of sight, and everything seemed to be finished.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.780]   But again something happened, and the church went on to a new and a mighty period of work
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.380]   and of success.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:37.340]   So I say it's sheer wisdom to do this, because this is what we have to do in our day and
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.260]   generation, as these people did it, and as it has been done, as I say, so many times
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.260]   subsequent to this.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.380]   Well, now it's clear, you see, that there are two things that are emphasized here.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.740]   There are two things that we've got to bear in our mind as Christian people, as members
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.380]   of the church, as we confront this appalling situation that is facing us.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.860]   There are to be two elements, if you like, in our strategy, in what we think of.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.860]   What are they?
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.700]   Well, the first is this.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:19.340]   We are His witnesses of these things, the apostolic witness, the truth.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:29.980]   But not only that, so is also, also, the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.980]   Him.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.660]   Here are the two elements that are essential to our success, the two elements that are
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.820]   most essential to us at the present time in meeting this menacing situation.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:53.620]   And I want to emphasize this very much, our danger always is to emphasize one or the other
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.300]   of these two elements, and to fail to realize that the two are essential.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.300]   What I mean is this.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.060]   There are some friends at the present time witnessing what is happening in the churches
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:12.380]   and in the world, and they say there's only one thing necessary, and that is that we should
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.260]   have an orthodox message, that we should know what the truth is.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.340]   What is needed, they say, is reformation, and they say that nothing else is needed.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.780]   The only thing that is necessary is that the preachers and others should come back to the
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.660]   New Testament unadulterated truth, should believe it and preach it and proclaim it.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.940]   That's all, they say, we need.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.440]   All we need is to declare the truth, and they stop at that.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.900]   We are his witnesses, the apostolic message.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:52.700]   But then you see there are other friends, and they go to another extreme.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.980]   They say, no, one thing only is necessary.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.860]   What is that?
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.060]   It is the witness of the Holy Spirit, and now these people belong to the second group.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.100]   They say, it doesn't matter very much what you believe.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.300]   There are men who are very uncertain about many of the doctrines.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   There are men who disagree about foundational doctrines, but it doesn't matter, they say.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.540]   If a man has had an experience of the Holy Ghost, nothing else matters.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:29.300]   So they're telling us that it doesn't matter whether we are Roman Catholics or Protestants,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.580]   it doesn't matter how liberal we are in our attitude to the Scripture and to many other
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580]   doctrines.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:40.620]   As long as we've got the witness of the Spirit, nothing else matters at all.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:46.780]   Now you're familiar with these two groups, and this is something that has tended to happen
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.920]   so frequently in the long story of the church.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.980]   People put their emphasis entirely on the one, or else on the other.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:02.780]   And so you see they become unscriptural, for the Scripture tells us that both are necessary.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:09.780]   We are his witnesses, so is also the Holy Ghost.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.020]   We must have orthodoxy, we must have truth.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.120]   We must come back to the apostolic message, but that alone is not enough.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.620]   There is another witness.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.320]   It is as if Peter was saying here, and indeed this is what he was saying, he said, "Here
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.620]   you are, I've just given you our witness, and we've done it before, and you're familiar
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.620]   with it."
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.620]   That's our witness.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.740]   "But if you don't accept that," says Peter, "look at this other witness.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:44.060]   This also, this additional witness, this further witness, listen to that witness, the witness
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.860]   of the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.580]   Now to me this is such a vital and all-important matter, that I must give proof of what I'm
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:00.540]   saying from the Scriptures themselves, and my dear friends, we are to be scriptural.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.400]   We are not to act in terms of what we think is right or best.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.180]   We are to be governed by the Scripture.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:13.860]   So let me demonstrate my point, that the two witnesses are essential, that orthodoxy alone,
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:21.100]   while it is essential, is not enough, and the witness of the Spirit alone is not enough.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.100]   You must have the two together.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.300]   Now let me give you the proof of what I'm saying.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:34.820]   And I go for my first proof to our blessed Lord himself, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.260]   Here he is, the Son of God.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:45.400]   Come into this world, and we know all that was so true of him.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:53.460]   But you remember that when he set out upon his public ministry at the age of 30, something
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.280]   happened to him.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.260]   He is the Son of God, in all the fullness of that meaning.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.500]   But before he entered on his ministry, something happened to him.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.780]   You remember that he went to John the Baptist to be baptized in the River Jordan, and after
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.900]   John had remonstrated, our Lord persuaded him to baptize him, and he did so.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.020]   But the important thing is what happened after that.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.580]   The accounts vary a little bit in their emphasis, either while he was still standing in the
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.500]   Jordan or else coming out of it.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:34.460]   The Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, and a voice came from heaven
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:43.180]   saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:53.540]   Now before even the Son of God could do his mediatorial saving work as a man in this world,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:01.620]   it was essential that the Holy Spirit should come upon him in this mighty manner.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.040]   And so, you remember, what we read at the beginning of the first chapter of the Gospel
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.940]   according to St. Luke is this.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.180]   This is immediately after that event.
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.620]   And Jesus, and was led of the Spirit into the wilderness, where he was tempted, you
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.580]   remember, for 40 days.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:29.420]   Then after that, I read in verse 14, "And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:35.140]   into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.580]   And then he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and as was his custom, he
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.100]   went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.860]   And they handed him a scroll of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.260]   And he began to read, and these were the words he read, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.780]   because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor, etc., etc."
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:06.700]   And then when he had handed the scroll back to the men, he uttered these extraordinary
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   words.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:17.620]   He said, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.620]   Isaiah prophesied concerning the coming of the Messiah.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:29.820]   And the Messiah, though he is the Son of God, can't exercise his ministry without the Spirit
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.100]   of the Lord coming upon him.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.000]   And that's what happened at the River Jordan at the time of his baptism.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:47.580]   Even the Son of God was unable to exercise this ministry without this baptism, this unction
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.260]   that came upon him when the Holy Spirit fell upon him.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:57.060]   And you will remember that in the third chapter of John's Gospel, John tells us, "God giveth
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.740]   not the Spirit by measure unto him."
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.340]   God gives his Spirit to his people, but he gave it to him in all its fullness, not by
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.340]   measure.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.540]   We receive the Spirit in measure, but God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.700]   He gave it him in all its fullness.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:22.380]   And again, you'll find in another place in John's Gospel, in chapter 6, "Him hath God
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.780]   the Father sealed."
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.140]   He sealed him by sending his Spirit upon him.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   John the Baptist had been told, he said, people thought that John was the Messiah.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.260]   You remember, John said, "I'm not the Messiah."
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.540]   "Well, who is the Messiah?"
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:46.140]   "Well," said John, "what I was told was this, the one on whom I would see the Holy Spirit
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.980]   descending like a dove, that's the Messiah."
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.900]   So he was able to say to his two followers, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.020]   sin of the world."
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:06.180]   The attestation, the power, come from the descent of the Holy Spirit in this remarkable
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.180]   manner.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.180]   And God, of course, from his birth, was filled with the Spirit in the sense that he is the
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.660]   eternal Son of God.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:20.540]   But in addition to this, there is an "also," and the Spirit came upon him and enabled him
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.060]   to work his mighty ministry.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.420]   But come, let us look at these apostles themselves.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.860]   Isn't it extraordinary how we can fail to realize a thing like this?
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.940]   You remember what we are told in the first chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:45.020]   Here were these apostles with our Lord after the resurrection, just before his ascension.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.940]   And he said to them, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.460]   not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, ye
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:02.660]   have heard of me, for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.040]   the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:12.700]   And then he adds to it in verse 8, "But you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:19.580]   is come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea, and
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.980]   in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth."
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.340]   Well now, here is the position.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.820]   Look at these men, the apostles.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.020]   They had been with our Lord for three years.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:36.860]   They had heard all his sermons and addresses, they had seen all his miracles, they had seen
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:43.140]   him arrested, condemned, they had seen him crucified, they had seen him dead, they had
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:50.460]   seen his body taken down and buried, they had seen him risen from the dead and the empty
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.460]   grave.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:58.260]   Well, you would have imagined, wouldn't you, that these men were already perfect witnesses.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.040]   What could you desire above this?
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   They knew it all.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.900]   They had all the facts, in every respect, with respect to him.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.700]   And yet what our Lord tells them is this, that as they are, they cannot be true witnesses
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.700]   to him.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.700]   Before they can be true witnesses, they've got to receive this baptism with the Holy
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.700]   Ghost.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.900]   "You are going to receive this," he said, "not many days hence.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.140]   You are going to receive this power."
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.340]   And then, and not until then, though they've got all the facts and all the truths, they
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.580]   cannot be witnesses to him.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.740]   So you see, this thing is here then quite unmistakable.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:48.660]   The witness of the apostles is essential, but also, this also, the Holy Ghost, they
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.500]   could do nothing apart from this.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.420]   And do you remember what happened to them after the day of Pentecost?
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:03.140]   And then, just to round off this bit of pure scriptural argumentation, which is nevertheless
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:08.260]   all important, you'll find exactly the same thing happened to the Apostle Paul.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:15.100]   There on the road to Damascus, he meets the Lord, and he begins to worship him, as it
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.580]   were, and surrenders himself to him.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.460]   But do you remember that it was necessary for a man called Ananias to come and to give
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:30.420]   the Apostle Paul this same gift and power of the Holy Spirit, before he can be an apostle
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.420]   in the same way?
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:37.060]   And still more striking, perhaps, is what you read in Acts chapter 11, in the case of
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.100]   the household of Cornelius.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.060]   The Apostle Peter, you remember, was called to preach to these Gentiles, and he was very
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.900]   unhappy about this, and very reluctant to do it.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:56.620]   Peter was a typical Jew, and as a Jew he couldn't see how a Gentile could possibly become related
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.700]   to God, and become a child of God.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.760]   And it was essential that God should give him a vision.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.140]   And do you remember the vision that he had in Joppa?
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.700]   And the vision convinced him sufficiently to make him go with the emissaries to the
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.380]   household of Cornelius.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.260]   And here he is now, he begins to preach in the household of Cornelius.
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:24.740]   And even while he was preaching, the Holy Ghost fell upon these people, Cornelius and
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.500]   the others, as it had upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.900]   And this was the thing that finally convinced Peter.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.060]   He says so.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.820]   He said so at the time, seeing this happening to him.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.060]   He's convinced now that Gentiles can become Christians, and so he baptized them.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:49.600]   He was most reluctant to do so, until the Holy Ghost had borne his witness.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.740]   Even the vision hadn't finally convinced him.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:57.900]   And then, in the next chapter, when he gives his defense in Jerusalem for what he'd done
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.300]   in baptizing these Gentiles, he puts his great question, "Who was I that I could refuse
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:11.100]   them water, after the witness and the testimony of the Holy Spirit?"
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:17.180]   So you see, right through this book, you get this dual witness.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:22.620]   Oh yes, the Orthodox truth, Reformation.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:28.900]   We are his witnesses, certainly, but that's not enough, especially in a time of crisis.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:38.580]   So is also this further witness of the Holy Ghost, attesting the truth and confirming
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.580]   it.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.380]   So I am stressing the all-importance of our bearing in mind these two things.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.540]   If we say that Reformation alone is enough, or if some experience of the Spirit alone
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.140]   is enough, we are not scriptural.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.060]   We are not keeping to the balance which is ever the greatest characteristic of the Word
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.060]   of God.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.060]   But let me go on to a second principle.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:11.360]   What is the object of the witness of the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.180]   The Holy Spirit is a witness, as we are witnesses.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.180]   To what does the Holy Spirit bear his witness?
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.900]   Now, here again is the most important matter.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.300]   There is perhaps more confusion in the churches today over this matter than over anything
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   else.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.860]   And it has happened many a time before in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.380]   I repeat again, we are not dealing with a new subject.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.940]   It's happened so often, but here it's dealt with in terms of the Scripture.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:55.820]   To what does the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Spirit, bear his witness?
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.260]   And the answer is perfectly plain.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.340]   Let me put it, first of all, negatively.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:08.320]   The Holy Spirit does not bear witness to himself, not to himself.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.860]   And again, I'm amazed that people can never forget this, because we've got such specific
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:21.260]   teaching on this subject, and from the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:27.980]   Take those great chapters in John's Gospel, chapters 14, 15, and 16.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:35.500]   Where our Lord is about to leave them, and they're crestfallen, and unhappy, disconsolate.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:43.060]   And he says, it's all right, you needn't be unhappy, another comforter is going to be given
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.060]   to you.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.100]   And he goes on and begins to teach them about the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.100]   What does he say?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.060]   Well, this is what he says, I'm reading from chapter 16, verse 12, "I have yet many things
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.620]   to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.540]   How be it when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth."
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:11.260]   And then he goes on, "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and he shall
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.020]   show it unto you."
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.740]   But he's already said, "How be it when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.700]   you into all truth, for he shall not speak of himself," which means out of himself, or
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:29.460]   from himself, "but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   things to come.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.500]   He shall glorify me."
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.820]   The Spirit never glorifies himself.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:47.180]   It's not surprising that the Holy Spirit came in the form of a dove, suggesting a delicacy
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.060]   and a shyness.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:56.060]   He can be easily grieved, he can be quenched, he can be offended.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:04.540]   The Spirit has been sent with one specific object, and that is not to direct attention
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:10.980]   to himself, but to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.500]   Well, let me give you a second negative.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.620]   The Spirit is not sent to glorify us.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.260]   The Spirit does not make us call attention to ourselves, and our experiences, and our
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.660]   gifts, or anything else that he has given us, or may have done to us, because that again
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.820]   would be glorifying himself.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.820]   He doesn't do this.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.380]   It's here, quite specifically, before us.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.980]   Well then, what does the Holy Spirit bear witness to?
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.940]   And Peter has said it once and forever.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.060]   We are his witnesses of what?
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   These things.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.740]   So is also the Holy Ghost.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.420]   What's he a witness to?
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   These things.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.420]   Well, what are they?
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.140]   Well, that's why I read the whole paragraph.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:03.620]   Peter said, "We ought to obey God rather than men, that God of our fathers hath raised
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:09.620]   up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a tree; him hath God exalted with his right hand,
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.620]   to be a prince, and a saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.460]   And we are witnesses of what?
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.040]   The Spirit, and his power, and the gifts we've had?
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   No.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   These things.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.620]   The things he's just been mentioning.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:30.900]   The Lord Jesus Christ, his person, and his work.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:37.820]   This Jesus, God has exalted him to be a prince, and a saviour, for to give repentance to Israel,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.260]   and forgiveness of sins.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.380]   That's what the Holy Spirit witnesses to.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:48.780]   Not to himself, not to us, not to what he does to us or gives to us.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:57.820]   His witness, his testimony, is to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to glorify him.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.900]   And this, of course, is a remarkable thing.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.580]   It's here everywhere in this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.860]   And that's why, you see, men and women who go astray do so because they begin to concentrate
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.500]   on experiences instead of being guided and governed by the Scripture.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.520]   Let me prove my point to you.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.820]   Take Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.020]   You remember that amazing event.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.940]   Suddenly these men are filled and baptized with the Holy Spirit as our Lord had prophesied
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.940]   would happen.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.340]   And it was a remarkable thing.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:37.500]   There was the sound of mighty rushing wind, gloving tongues as of fire, speaking in other
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.060]   tongues, and so on.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.940]   And, of course, it was a great sensation, and the people came together from everywhere
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.260]   to hear and to see these men.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.260]   And Peter, we are told, got up and he began to preach.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.460]   And he stood up and said, "What is this?"
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.140]   He said, "Some of you are saying we are drunk.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.140]   We are not.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.860]   These are not drunken, as he supposed, seeing it was but the third hour of the day.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   What is this?"
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.720]   "Well," he said, "this is actually what was prophesied by the prophet Joel."
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.060]   And he quotes Joel's prophecy.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.540]   Then he begins to preach.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.580]   And what does he say when he begins to preach?
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:17.100]   Does he now tell them of the experience they had while they were waiting in the upper room?
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.560]   Does he tell them what he and the others have felt, and their abilities and their gifts?
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.560]   Nothing of the sort.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.560]   Listen.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.620]   "You men of Israel," he says in verse 22, "hear these words."
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.620]   He's beginning to preach.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.120]   Now, remember, this man is filled with the Spirit.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.020]   He's baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.340]   What does he talk about?
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:43.900]   "Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.100]   which God did by him, him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.300]   of God.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:55.020]   You have taken him by wicked hands, put him to death, and so on, whom God hath raised
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   up."
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.020]   What does he preach about?
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   Jesus Christ.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.940]   Not about—he doesn't preach about the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:08.500]   He preached about the Lord Jesus Christ, his person and his work, and he expounds on the
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.940]   meaning of the death of Christ, and goes on to talk about the resurrection.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.460]   Here it is, plain evidence.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:23.980]   The Spirit in all the power of the day of Pentecost doesn't call attention to himself,
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.540]   but always to the Lord Jesus Christ in his person and his work.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.860]   But go on to chapter 3.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.580]   Do you remember the incident of Peter and John going up one afternoon to the temple
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.580]   to pray?
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.340]   They're suddenly accosted by this poor lame fellow at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:46.020]   And in a miraculous manner, Peter and John healed the men.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.460]   And of course, this created another tremendous incision, and the people came crowding together
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.700]   from everywhere as the lame men, which was healed, held Peter and John, all the people
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:03.060]   ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's Greatly Wandering.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.620]   And Peter decided to preach again.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.620]   When Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, and here's his sermon.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.580]   You men of Israel, why marvel ye at this?
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:23.780]   Or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.220]   man to walk?
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.900]   "It's not us," says Peter, "don't look at us."
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.100]   He didn't preach, you see, about their experiences and their gifts.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   He didn't preach about the Holy Ghost.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.100]   What does he say?
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.400]   "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.780]   Son Jesus."
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.900]   Another sermon on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.260]   You denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.740]   You killed the Prince of Life whom God raised from the dead.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:58.380]   His name, through faith in His name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.820]   Yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.820]   of you all.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.900]   Once more, he doesn't preach about the Spirit nor about himself and their gifts, always
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.300]   about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   And, go on, next chapter, Peter and John are arrested and they're on trial.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.100]   And, again, Peter does exactly the same thing.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:28.580]   Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, "Ye rulers of Israel and elders of the
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:33.500]   people and elders of Israel, if you're examining us, be it known unto you and to all the people
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:40.220]   of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.300]   from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand here before you all."
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.060]   He does exactly the same thing again, and he goes on doing it.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.940]   You see, the test of whether a man is filled by the Holy Spirit or not is this.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:02.700]   It's not how much does he talk about the Holy Spirit and the gifts that he's received.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.340]   It's how much does he glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.340]   This is the test.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:15.340]   And, as you go through the Scriptures, you will find it invariably and everywhere.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:22.420]   And, what he bears witness to and glorifies is these things, the person of the Lord Jesus
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.500]   Christ.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.660]   No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   He makes men orthodox, he must do so, because he's sent to glorify the Lord.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:40.340]   And, people who are filled with the Spirit, they testify that Jesus of Nazareth is the
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:46.420]   eternal Son of God, the only begotten Son of God, this Prince and also this Savior.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.540]   They're clear about his death, the meaning of his death, why he came, why he had to come.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.740]   As Peter expounded immediately the doctrine of the atonement on the day of Pentecost,
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.300]   so men and women who are filled with the Spirit, they bear their witness to, and the Spirit
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.460]   does the same, always, to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:17.340]   He shall glorify me, not himself, and not the people to whom he has come in great power.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.740]   And this is indeed a remarkable thing.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.980]   I've taken the trouble recently to check this matter.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:32.100]   You know, the writers of the hymn books, they are generally scriptural, and I've been working
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.780]   it out in terms of this new hymn book.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.620]   I wonder if they've ever noticed this.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:44.500]   If you turn up the synopsis at the beginning, the table of contents, you'll find that the
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:54.780]   number of hymns that are devoted to the Lord Jesus Christ, 179.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.120]   How many are devoted to the Holy Spirit?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:05.780]   You will find, I think, that the number devoted to the Spirit are more like 27.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:15.500]   179 hymns to the Lord Jesus Christ, 27 to the Holy Ghost.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.540]   That's absolutely right.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.500]   That's the scriptural proportion.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.420]   Now this is an interesting thing, isn't it?
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.660]   Look at these great hymns that we are so fond of singing.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.900]   Take the hymns of a man like Charles Wesley.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:34.100]   Oh, here was a man, you see, who'd been a godly man, and indeed a Christian man for
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.700]   some time, but he hadn't received this baptism with the Spirit.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.780]   But then he received this baptism, and he became a great evangelist with his brother
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.340]   John.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.940]   But he became a great hymn writer.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.780]   Now here was a man, you see, filled with the Spirit.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.820]   What does he write about in his hymns?
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.760]   Not the Holy Spirit, but the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.360]   If I tested you as a congregation, I have no doubt as to the answer.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.940]   If I asked you to name a single hymn by Charles Wesley on the Holy Spirit, I don't think
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.140]   you'd be able to give me one.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.460]   There are one or two.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.700]   I don't think you'd be able to give me one.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.700]   Why?
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.340]   Well, because his great and characteristic hymns are these.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:26.940]   "Jesus, lover of my soul," "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise."
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.700]   Or take it here in Wales, William Williams, Pantechelion.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.100]   Another man filled with the Spirit, as those men were two hundred years ago.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.900]   What are his great hymns?
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:43.660]   Well, all his great hymns, as is true of Anne Griffiths and others, are about the Lord Jesus
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:49.060]   Christ, His person, and about His death upon the cross.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.940]   This is an amazing thing.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:57.300]   The preaching of these men and the hymns of these men is always about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.540]   Of course they believed a full doctrine of the Holy Spirit, but they were not always
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.980]   talking about the Spirit and preaching about the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:12.340]   No, no, their emphasis and all the use of their gifts was to glorify the Lord Jesus
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   Christ.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:21.860]   So, the test of having received a great experience of the Holy Ghost is not that you talk the
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:31.020]   whole time about the Holy Ghost, but that you glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:39.640]   The Holy Spirit is sent in order to do this special work, and that is what He has invariably
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   done.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.920]   Those of you, if there are any of you left, who are old enough to remember the last revival
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.660]   here in Wales, will remember that the favorite hymns of the revival were not about the Holy
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:56.540]   Spirit, but "Waed a grois yn god i fynyr, eidh il ymgyngh fer yr mawr," the blood of
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.540]   the cross.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:05.860]   "An y dyfrodd mawr ar tannau i nyd ysne, bydda i'l fy men, an fy annwyl bryod i esu,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:12.220]   rhwn fy fawrw ar y prenn," "Diolch iddo, bydd am gofio llwch ysra."
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.220]   These were the hymns.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   It's interesting.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:20.820]   The Spirit had been poured forth, but you see, the talk was not about the Spirit, nor
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.820]   gifts.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:30.060]   The talk was about the Lord Jesus Christ and His death, His atonement, His blood, His glorious
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.620]   resurrection and the way of salvation.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.100]   So my dear friends, let's come back to the Scripture.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:45.660]   The evidence of the Spirit and its essential is an evidence which attests the person and
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.340]   the work of the glorious Son of God.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:55.740]   But that brings me to my last principle, which is this.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.060]   How does the Spirit bear this witness?
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:07.940]   We are His witnesses of these things, so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.100]   them that obey Him.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.600]   How does He do so?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.820]   And this again is most important because there's much confusion about this at the present time.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:23.820]   What is clear is this, isn't it, that Peter was obviously calling attention to something
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.180]   outside himself and outside the apostles.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:34.220]   He said we are His witnesses in the totality of our persons and the whole of our ministry.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:41.860]   Now says Peter, in addition to this also, there is this objective, external witness
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.620]   outside us.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.900]   He can point to something outside himself and the other apostles.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:55.480]   This to me is a very important matter and especially in the confusion that is prevailing
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.100]   at the present time.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:05.380]   How did the Spirit bear witness and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.780]   And here are the answers.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:17.220]   He did so first of all, and perhaps most important of all, in His coming on the day of Pentecost.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   How is that important?
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.540]   Well in this way.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:27.820]   Our Lord, as I've already told you, had predicted and had prophesied that the Spirit was going
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   to come.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:37.500]   He'd even said it is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away the comforter
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.620]   will not come unto you, but if I go away I will send him unto you.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.980]   Now he'd committed himself to this.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:51.220]   He said don't be downcast, don't be depressed, I'm going, but I'm going to send you the Spirit.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.780]   And again, you get the same thing in the seventh chapter of John's Gospel, that great day
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.940]   of the feast, when he said any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.900]   And he said if a man does that, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.300]   And then we're given the explanation, this speaking of the Spirit that they who believed
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:18.380]   in him are going to receive, for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.380]   glorified.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:28.420]   And he goes on doing this, making these explicit promises, and even just before his ascension,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:35.180]   after the resurrection, as I've told you already in chapter one, he says stay where you are.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.420]   Not many days hence something's going to happen to you.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.180]   The Spirit is going to come upon you, you're going to be baptized with the Spirit in great
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.180]   power.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.780]   He's committed himself to this.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:52.540]   So if the Spirit had not come, he would have been a false teacher.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:41:00.380]   But the Spirit came, and in coming, and he came, remember, in a phenomenal manner, in
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.620]   a way that was a spectacle, that astonished people and made them come together.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.220]   And people looking on said what is this?
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.220]   Are they drunk?
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.220]   What is this?
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.180]   He bore witness, he glorified the Lord.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.860]   He said he said this was going to come, I've come.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:21.660]   So you see the Spirit does it partly by the very act of coming.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:27.660]   As he came on the great day of Pentecost, I can't answer my own question fully, I'd
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.780]   keep you to midnight if I tried to.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.500]   He does it in many other ways.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:37.380]   Of course he does give gifts to us, but still more important, at the present time as it
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:46.300]   was here at the beginning, it's what he does in this kind of phenomenal external manner
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.300]   that rarely counts.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   Now let me show you.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.620]   I've told you what happened on the day of Pentecost, we'll then go again back to chapter
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   4, Peter and John on trial, and they're fighting for their lives once more.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:04.620]   And this is what I read when Peter was allowed to speak, I read Peter filled with the Holy
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.620]   Ghost.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.880]   The Spirit came again upon him.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.020]   You remember the story of Stephen, the martyr Stephen?
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.660]   People saw his face shining.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.540]   This is an external witness and evidence.
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.340]   Peter, Stephen didn't give his experience.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.380]   You read chapter 7 of this book, Peter, Stephen didn't give his experience, these men didn't.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:31.060]   They never preached about themselves, they never preached about the Spirit, they preached
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.540]   about the Lord Jesus Christ invariably.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:41.740]   Well then go on to this, further on in chapter 4.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:47.420]   When Peter and John had been dismissed by the Sanhedrin, we are told that they, being
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:54.020]   let go, they went to their own company and they reported all that the chief priests and
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.260]   elders had said unto them, and what happened?
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.220]   Well, the church immediately began to pray, they could do nothing else.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:06.540]   They cried unto God with one accord and pleaded with him to come to their vindication, a vindication
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.540]   of his own son.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:13.140]   They said, "For a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.660]   Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.900]   Now, Lord, behold, they are threatening," and they pleaded with him to do something.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   What did he do?
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:31.980]   When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, the Holy
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.620]   Ghost shook the building.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.620]   That's how he does it.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:41.900]   Now, this isn't Christian people giving their experiences, it's a building shaking.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.580]   This is the evidence and witness of the Spirit.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:51.340]   The Spirit witnesses in an external, phenomenal manner, which is something you can point to.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:59.060]   The building shook and then the men went on and began to give great witness to the resurrection
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.060]   of Christ.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:06.340]   And he did it the same way in the death of Ananias and Sapphira at the beginning of this
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   fifth chapter.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.340]   A fact, a phenomenon.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.700]   They had lied to the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:16.100]   Well, the Holy Ghost bore witness to Jesus by killing them, putting them to death.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.500]   A phenomenon.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.580]   And this is the thing I would like to leave in your minds and on your hearts.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:30.960]   My dear friends, we are living in evil days, as I said at the beginning.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.780]   We are fighting for the Christian faith, the Christian truth, for the whole future of the
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.780]   Christian church.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.780]   How can we do it?
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.780]   Well, we are to bear witness.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.780]   Thank God.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.780]   God gives us grace to do it.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:48.180]   Some of us are Orthodox and we are preaching the Orthodox truth and we've been doing it
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.180]   for many years.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.900]   But we see what's happening, don't we?
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   What's to be done?
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.940]   Have an evangelistic campaign, all right, you can have them, but you'll find it'll make
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.500]   no difference.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.620]   We've tried all this.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.460]   Give entertainment to the people, bring in pop music, bring in a band.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   We've tried it all.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.460]   It's all been done.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.920]   It doesn't work, does it?
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   No, no.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   There is only one other factor which is absolutely essential.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.780]   It is the witness of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.340]   And I mean this.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.820]   This is what is so important.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.860]   I don't mean so much the work of the Spirit which he does in us when he convicts us of
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.540]   sin and when he regenerates us and when he gives us certain abilities.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.660]   And God, many of us here this afternoon, can testify to all this.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.420]   But this isn't enough.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:46:00.500]   There is the need of this also, this further witness of the Spirit outside us, a phenomenon,
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.460]   something striking, something amazing, something that arrests not only the people in the churches
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.220]   but the people outside in the world.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.500]   And they come crowding as they did on the day of Pentecost and say, "What's happened?
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   What is this?"
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   What do I mean?
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   That's what I mean by revival.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   Revival.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:22.220]   There are people today who are having remarkable experiences, and I notice that increasingly
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.460]   they're referring to it as renewal.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.340]   They're quite right.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340]   It is renewal.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.340]   It's not revival.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:33.500]   They say, "You all have the Spirit, you are all baptized with the Spirit at your regeneration.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.220]   And all you need to do now is to realize you've got it and to yield yourself to it and you'll
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   find a great..."
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220]   All right.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.220]   Do it, my friends.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.220]   All I'm saying is this.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:46.340]   That is not the witness of the Spirit.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:53.340]   The witness of the Spirit is this external phenomenal evidence.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:59.860]   And this is what you get, of course, in all great revivals.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.540]   And the greatest need of this hour is another revival of religion.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   What's that?
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.100]   Well, I say again, it's not an organized campaign.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.700]   I'm not of necessity speaking against these things.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.220]   Do it if you like.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   All I'm saying is that's not revival.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.220]   Well, what is revival?
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:23.940]   Revival is, in a sense, a repetition of what happened on the day of Pentecost.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.100]   It is a falling down of the Spirit.
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.460]   It is the Spirit coming upon people.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.420]   As he did on the day of Pentecost, as he did upon Peter before the Sanhedrin, as he did
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:39.660]   upon the church when they were praying and the walls began to shake, the Spirit came
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660]   down.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   That's revival.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:47.860]   And that is the only thing which is going to attract people back to our churches at
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.700]   this time in which we are living.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.380]   We've tried, I say, everything else.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.020]   Orthodox preaching, campaigns, entertainment, everything's been done.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.300]   Still the people are outside.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.580]   The moment the Spirit comes down, you'll find them crowding back again.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   The witness of the Spirit has come into evidence.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.700]   Well, what is this, said someone?
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.500]   Let me put it like this to you, and with this I close.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.100]   This is what happens always in every period of revival.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:25.660]   You take this last revival in Wales, 19.4 and 5, part of 6.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.060]   And you'll find, you know, that sometimes men and women were converted, not in meetings
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:35.460]   but on the way to the meeting, not even arrived at the meeting.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.980]   Spirit fell upon them.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:42.140]   You hear of men working underground in collieries, suddenly they drop on their knees.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   Why?
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.140]   The Spirit has come upon them.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.140]   A phenomenon.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.140]   And everybody talked about it.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.780]   The Western Mail even gave great prominence to it.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.580]   All the papers do.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.500]   It's a phenomenon, not an organized phenomenon.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.500]   Nobody organized it.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.940]   Evan Roberts, I don't think, ever organized a meeting in his life.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.880]   And what happened to him was not organized.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.700]   It's the Spirit doing things, it's the Spirit coming.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.920]   And this is the characteristic of every revival that has ever been known.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.800]   You may have heard of a great South African teacher called Andrew Murray.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.320]   He used to come a lot to this country in the early part of this century.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:26.160]   If you read the biography of that man, you'll find that he was in one of his churches, and
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.320]   he was at his weekly prayer meeting, and he was, as usual, sitting at the table presiding
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.320]   over the meeting.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.960]   He wasn't expecting anything to happen, and he did nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:42.080]   But he tells us that there he was sitting at the table, and suddenly he was aware of
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.080]   a sound.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.600]   And the sound got nearer and nearer and louder and louder, and he couldn't make out what
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   it was.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.320]   He suddenly realized what it was.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.560]   The Spirit fell upon the meeting.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.880]   The revival broke out.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.720]   Andrew Murray did nothing.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   Nobody else did.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.560]   The Spirit came, and it was a phenomenon.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.680]   The revival lasted months, large numbers of people were converted.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.440]   The church became bigger and mightier, and it spread to others.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.440]   That's revival.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:16.920]   You see, it's entirely the falling of the Spirit upon people.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.440]   But let me give you, perhaps, one of the best descriptions of what I'm talking about that
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:28.920]   has ever been given out of the journal of John Wesley, for January the 1st, 1739.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:37.680]   John Wesley says at this point that 60 friends, he was amongst them, and his brother Charles
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:44.160]   and the great George Whitefield and many other prominent leaders in the Methodist awakening
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:51.520]   and revival of 200 years ago, they met together to have what they called a love feast in Fetter
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.200]   Lane in London.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:00.840]   You know, going out to the old year and the coming in of the new, and a watch night service,
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.560]   love feast, singing, praying, and so on.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.600]   Now this is what John Wesley writes, I'm reading his exact words.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:21.660]   About three in the morning, as we were continuing instant in prayer, the power of God came mightily
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:30.840]   upon us, insomuch that many cried out for exceeding joy, and many fell to the ground.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:38.920]   As soon as we were recovered a little from the awe and amazement at the presence of his
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:49.320]   majesty, we broke out with one voice, "We praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   be the Lord."
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.080]   That's what I'm talking about, that's the witness of the Spirit.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.800]   It wasn't anything they did, the Spirit fell upon them, three o'clock in the morning.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:05.280]   They hadn't organized it, it wasn't organized singing, it wasn't organized anything, it
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.960]   was a free meeting.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:15.000]   And the Spirit fell upon them, the power of God came mightily upon us, they didn't try
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.240]   to work up the power of God by singing and this and that, we are so familiar with, no,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   no.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:30.760]   The power of God came mightily upon us, that's the witness of the Spirit.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:36.040]   And you know, it was really from that point onwards, much more than what happened to him
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:43.880]   in the previous, May the 24th in 1738, that turned this man into a flaming evangelist.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.960]   This I say is the story of all revivals, Christian people, especially here in Wales.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   Have we forgotten revivals?
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:02.040]   This has been the glory of our land and the church in this land, series of great revivals.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.380]   People have forgotten about this, so many years have passed, they're no longer thinking
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.380]   about this.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:12.280]   They're talking about themselves and experiences and about the Spirit, no, no.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:17.960]   We must bear witness to the Lord Jesus Christ and pray that the Spirit may come, and in
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:25.400]   a phenomenal, amazing, astonishing manner, will fall upon us and bear his witness in
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   this external manner.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   And you'll find the people will be arrested, they'll come crowding to hear and to see
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   what it is.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.760]   Perhaps in criticism, it doesn't matter, but they'll come and listen to the gospel.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.880]   And when they come, what are we to tell them?
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.840]   Not about ourselves, not about what's happened to us.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.080]   We're not even to preach directly or overmuch about the Spirit.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:55.800]   We are to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, this Prince, this Saviour, and pray that under
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:02.880]   his influence, and it will happen, many will be convinced and convicted of sin, believe
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:09.560]   in him and in his blood, be born again and become members of the Christian church.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.040]   My friends, it is the only hope.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:21.240]   Go on with our witness, go on with our orthodox preaching, but still more, I would say, let
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:30.640]   us pray without ceasing for another outpouring of the Spirit, another descent of the power
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:38.080]   of God upon us that will, first of all, amaze us, because we've had nothing to do with it.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:46.600]   And then will amaze and astonish the world, lead to many, many conversions and a new period
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:53.640]   of success and of prosperity in the history of God's church here upon earth.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:55:01.760]   Let's not forget the also, so is also, the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   obey him.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:08.400]   And you obey him by believing his truth and by proclaiming it and preaching it and testifying
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   to it.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:18.280]   And then he will bear his witness in this amazing and astonishing manner.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.880]   God have mercy upon us.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:28.240]   O Lord, our God, we cry unto thee, as thy church did in those early days, have mercy
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.680]   upon us.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:35.560]   We know that the world is not interested in us and is not persecuting us because we
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.320]   are what we are.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.680]   We know that it is against thy holy child, Jesus, that all this is happening.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:50.080]   And we can but cry unto thee, as they did, vindicate thy truth in an unmistakable manner
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:56.600]   by sending thy Spirit upon us and into our midst in a manner that none can gainsay.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:05.920]   Lord, grant again this mighty phenomenon of revival in our needy land and revive thy work
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.520]   in the midst of these cruel years.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:15.760]   And unto thee, and unto thee alone, shall we give all the praise and all the honor and
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.440]   all the glory, both now and forever.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.200]   Amen.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
