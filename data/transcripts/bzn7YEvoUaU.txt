[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   As part of the MIT Autonomous Vehicle Technology Study, we're instrumenting cars with various
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.240]   degrees of automation.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.040]   So let's take a look at one of those cars, a Tesla Model S, and look at our instrumentation.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.900]   Inside the car, we have three cameras.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.680]   One is looking at the driver's face, and that's capturing things like where the driver is
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.860]   looking, the drowsiness state of the driver, the emotional state, and also cognitive load.
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.880]   We have a camera looking at the driver's body, a fisheye lens camera that's capturing the
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.600]   entire body of the driver, including hands.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.940]   That's giving you information about whether the hands are off-wheel, whether the body
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.740]   is aligned, and further supplementary information about the state of the driver that the face
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.320]   camera provides.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.800]   And finally, there's a forward-facing camera attached to the windshield that's looking
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300]   at the forward roadway, and it's capturing everything in the external environment, such
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300]   as the vehicles, the lanes, and other characteristics of the road.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.900]   Having these three cameras in the car allows us to study driver behavior and interaction
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.220]   with automation.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.500]   So the driver-facing camera, looking at the face, a camera looking at the body, and a
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.280]   camera looking at the outside environment allows us to understand over hundreds of thousands
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.300]   of miles of real-world driving, how people interact with these technologies, how we can
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.940]   have artificial intelligence systems play an important role in keeping us safe and providing
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.900]   an enjoyable experience in driving.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.420]   We have now, to date, collected 275,000 miles of real-world driving and interaction with
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.820]   autonomous systems in Tesla Model S vehicles, in Land Rover Evoque vehicles, and a Volvo
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.820]   S90.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.580]   But most importantly, once that data is collected, it's just raw pixels.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.020]   3.5 billion video frames of raw pixels.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.020]   We're using computer vision, deep learning methods, to convert those pixels into knowledge,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.820]   into understanding of what the drivers are actually doing with these systems.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.980]   That comes from the face camera, that comes from the body camera, and the forward-facing
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.420]   camera.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.100]   Understanding comes from actually being able to touch every single one of those frames
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.980]   and convert them into behavior of human beings as they interact with these artificial intelligence
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.500]   systems.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   3.5 billion frames of real-world driving.

[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   3.5 billion frames of real-world driving.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   3.5 billion frames of real-world driving.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   3.5 billion frames of real-world driving.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   3.5 billion frames of real-world driving.
