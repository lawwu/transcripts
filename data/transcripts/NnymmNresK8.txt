[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   I always start with that.
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.360]   What is the purpose of this email
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.540]   is to teach them like a specific lesson
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.360]   or get them to take a specific action.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.240]   It generally makes everything a lot more interesting.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.840]   So finding the reason is the first thing
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.900]   that people need to do
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.140]   if they're gonna write about something
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.360]   before they ever start writing.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.940]   Okay, so do you do that anytime you're sending a memo,
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.760]   writing an email?
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.840]   Let's pretend I've gotta send an email
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.160]   to someone I collaborate with at work
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.980]   to try to get them to see my perspective on a project.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.920]   So instead of just me raw dumping all my thoughts
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.280]   onto an email and expecting them to read it,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.400]   I'm thinking about them.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.500]   If I just raw dump full page or two of my thoughts,
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.700]   now they have to read this.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.240]   This is giving them more work.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.880]   So anytime I get a long email too,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.480]   someone's like, hey, can you help me with this?
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.720]   I'm like, you're giving me an assignment?
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.220]   Now I have more work because of you.
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.020]   So I always think like,
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.740]   how can I make this person's life easier?
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.840]   And so I could just say,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.380]   hey, Chris, I have thoughts on this.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.280]   You got time in 10 minutes to talk,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.620]   call my number, something like that.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.340]   Something that's very easy for them
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.700]   or give them bullet points of what I'm thinking.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.340]   And then maybe we could discuss it further.
