[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.400]   the book of Exodus in chapter 33, reading verse 17. The 17th verse in the 33rd chapter
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   of the book of Exodus, "And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.120]   thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name." Those
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.520]   who attend here regularly will know that we have been examining this great and important
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.120]   33rd chapter of the book of Exodus for a number of Sunday mornings, as it gives us a picture
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:52.300]   and an illustration of the Church in her impotence and weakness, praying to God for some unusual
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.640]   manifestation of his presence, his glory, and his power.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.560]   Now, we have been doing that because it is a kind of pattern and norm of what the Church
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:17.360]   has done so frequently in other days and ages and generations. And we are looking at all
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.680]   this, of course, because of the situation in which we find ourselves today. Well, now
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   we come to this particular verse because, having considered what Moses prayed for, and
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.180]   why he prayed for it, and how he prayed for it, we come now to God, hearing Moses and
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.180]   giving him an answer, and promising him that he will do this very thing for him and for
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.740]   the children of Israel which had thus been requested. So our subject is God having pity
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.700]   and mercy upon the Church and sending his blessing.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.180]   Now this is with Sunday morning, but you see there is no need for us to interrupt our series
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.220]   because this day of all days is very much at the centre of the very thing that we are
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:27.060]   considering together. For revival, after all, is nothing but God hearing the people and
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.180]   having mercy upon them and answering them by giving this manifestation of his glory
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.580]   and his strength and his power. That is really what revival means. And it is important, therefore,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.920]   for us to understand it and to know something of what adenorate we should be anticipating
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.580]   and what we should be seeking in our prayers. And, of course, there is no doubt at all about
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.740]   this, the way to discover that is to go back to this second chapter of the book of the
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.540]   Acts of the Apostles. It is a truism to say that every revival of religion that the Church
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.180]   has ever known has been, in a sense, a kind of repetition of what happened on the day
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:29.500]   of Pentecost. It has been a return to that origin, to that beginning. It has been a reviving.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.460]   Now there is a great deal, it seems to me, of very loose and dangerous talk and writing
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.200]   about what happened on the day of Pentecost. People go on repeating one after another that
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.500]   what happened on the day of Pentecost was once and for all and forever, never to be
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.260]   repeated. Now it is important that we should examine that because if that is really true,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.980]   well then it is very wrong to pray for revival. Very wrong indeed. But, of course, it just
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.140]   is not true. There is only one sense in which what happened on the day of Pentecost cannot
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.980]   be repeated, and that is simply this, that it did happen to be the first of a series.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.820]   Of course, you cannot repeat the first, but the fact that you cannot repeat the first
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.400]   does not mean for a moment that what happened on the first occasion cannot happen again.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.260]   And every revival of religion, I say, is really a repetition of what happened on the day of
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.500]   Pentecost. Now it is really almost incredible that people
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.260]   should go on saying this, that what happened on Pentecost was once and for all, never repeated.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.560]   Because if you go to the eleventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles and
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.440]   look there at Peter making his defense for having baptized Cornelius and his household,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.580]   they being Gentiles, you will remember that what Peter said was something like this. I
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.620]   will start reading, if you like, at verse 12. He said, "And the Spirit bade me go with
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.620]   them, nothing doubting. Moreover, these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.140]   the men's house," that is to say, Cornelius' household. "And he showed us how he had seen
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.340]   an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.860]   Simon, whose surname is Peter, who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:43.700]   shall be saved. And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning."
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.460]   You notice what he says. The Apostle says that the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:59.040]   his household as on us at the beginning. He said the same thing happened to them as happened
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.660]   to us on the day of Pentecost. Then he goes on to say this, "Then remembered I the word
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.600]   of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.180]   with the Holy Ghost." What he means is this. He says, "I remembered that John had said
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.740]   that this baptism with the Holy Ghost was going to come. It had happened to us on the
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.180]   day of Pentecost. I now saw that it was happening to these people." In other words, the baptism
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.660]   of the Holy Ghost took place on the day of Pentecost, but it also took place later upon
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.140]   Cornelius and his household. That is exactly Peter's argument. "But then I remembered
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:47.580]   the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.620]   with the Holy Ghost. For as much then as God gave them the like gift," the same gift you
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.260]   see, "as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:09.260]   withstand God?" He repeats the same argument again on a later occasion.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:16.060]   Now then, I do trust we are clear about this, and that we really must cease to say that
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:23.020]   what happened on the day of Pentecost happened once and for all. It did not. It was simply
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.780]   the first of a series. I am ready to admit you cannot repeat the first, but that is nothing.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.660]   What matters is the thing that happened. And the thing that happened happened later in
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.540]   exactly the same way. While Peter was preaching to Cornelius and his household, the Holy Ghost
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.660]   fell upon them as he had fallen upon these people in the upper room there on the day
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:58.860]   of Pentecost at Jerusalem. And of course, my argument is that that is exactly what happens
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.780]   in every revival. There is indeed even further evidence which I can adduce for you. You will
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.380]   find that the same thing even happened a few days after the day of Pentecost to the apostles
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.700]   and others. In Acts chapter 4 you will find it. There they went back after they had been
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.620]   prohibited to preach any longer in the name of Jesus Christ, and they all prayed together.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.900]   And we are told in verse 31, "And when they prayed, the place was shaken where they were
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.020]   assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost." That is exactly the
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.040]   term used in the second chapter. The term baptism is not used in the second chapter,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.980]   but it means the baptism. Our Lord had said, "Tarry ye in Jerusalem; you shall be baptized
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.220]   not many days hence." So what happened on the day of Pentecost was the baptism of the
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.220]   Holy Ghost. It is described in these words. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.340]   But here they were filled again with the Holy Ghost. It was not anything that they did.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.220]   It was that which happened to them. All they did was to pray. Then God poured out his Spirit
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.860]   upon them again and filled them until they were overflowing. They were filled with the
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:13.780]   Holy Ghost, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness. Now that is precisely what
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:25.420]   happens in revival. It is God pouring forth his Spirit, filling his people again. It is
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:31.340]   not the thing that is talked of in Ephesians 5.18, which is a command to us, "Go on being
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.620]   filled with the Spirit." That is something you and I do. But this is something that is
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.580]   done to us. It is the Spirit falling upon us, being poured out upon us. These are the
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:49.220]   terms. I will pour forth my Spirit. God alone can do that. But it is you and I who are responsible
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.820]   for going on being filled with the Spirit. We must not grieve the Spirit. We must not
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.260]   quench the Spirit. We must give obedience to the Spirit. And as long as we do that,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.580]   we shall go on being filled with the Spirit. This is different. This is the Spirit being
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:10.300]   poured upon us until we are filled to overflowing. Shed forth. These are the terms. But so much
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.280]   of the modern teaching never uses these scriptural terms at all. You never find them talking
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.720]   or writing about the Spirit being poured forth or shed forth. Never mentioned. No, because
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.300]   of this theory, you see, that what happened on the day of Pentecost happened once and
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.580]   for all. There is not a word in Scripture to say that. Indeed, as I have shown you,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:39.700]   the Scripture says quite plainly and clearly and explicitly the exact opposite. The Spirit
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:48.940]   fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. My dear friends, let us be careful that we
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:57.260]   do not quench the Spirit in the interest of some theory or in a fear of certain freak
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.940]   religious bodies. Very well then. Having cleared that point,
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:12.500]   let us go on to consider what happens when this takes place. What is revival, says somebody?
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:19.820]   Why are you concerned about this? Why do you go on urging us to pray for this? The answer
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:28.380]   is that this above everything else is what is needed today. When will the Christian Church
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:38.420]   come to realise this? The Church, and mark you, this feast of Pentecost, this Whitsun
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:46.060]   Tide, is in particular the festival of the Church. Oh, is there any tragedy comparable
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:53.580]   to this? The failure of the Church to realise that this is her need and that this is her
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.500]   only hope. But you know, the Church does not realise it. We are in the month of May. It
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:07.260]   is the month for the May meetings, annual assemblies of all the great denominations.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.740]   And they are meeting. And what are they doing? Have you been reading the reports? If it were
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.460]   not tragic, it would be laughable, because this is what they are doing. They are investigating
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.940]   the situation, the problem confronting the Church. There are the facts, they say. Now
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:33.060]   then, what are we to do? And what have they done? Has there been a great call to prayer
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:41.420]   and fasting, to humiliation, and to a crying out to God to have mercy and to baptise us
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.860]   afresh with the Holy Ghost? Has it been that? No, I think what you will find is this. They
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:56.740]   have appointed special commissions. In one case, they have appointed eight special commissions
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:05.980]   to enquire into the situation. I say, if it were not tragic, it indeed would be most laughable.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.500]   Setting up committees to investigate. Of course, that is what the politicians do, I know. That
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.300]   is what a businessman does, and in those realms it is absolutely right. It is the obvious,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.500]   common sense thing to do. But in the name of God, I ask, isn't it tragic that the Christian
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:29.060]   Church should be doing that? With the world as it is today, commissions to investigate,
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:35.420]   commissions of enquiry, and indeed one commission even to report as to what the Christian faith
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:43.820]   really is and how it is to be expressed. With the world on fire, with hell let loose, the
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:50.300]   Christian Church is trying to discover what her message is. She is seeking for some way
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.840]   of meeting the situation. Commissions of investigation. It is true of all sections of the Christian
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:04.300]   Church. They are all in exactly the same condition. Not a word about the need for this power,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:13.100]   not a call to prayer and to humiliation and to agony in the presence of God.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:19.900]   The Church does everything except that which the Lord himself commended the early Church
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.620]   to do. Ah, but the Church says, you know the conditions are different now. This is twentieth
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:34.180]   century. Oh, I am not going to insult you by keeping you with an answer to that. Not
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:43.820]   twentieth century has nothing to do with the situation at all. Man in sin does not change.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.540]   The world has always said that and the Church has always mentioned this change, this difference.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:54.660]   My friends, we are talking about the power of God. And when we are talking about the
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:01.180]   power of God, to talk of superficial changes in men is not only an irrelevance, it is to
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:09.900]   be an unsensible. The world, I say, has always been the same. Look at the position here in
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.140]   the book of Acts of the Apostles. Can you imagine any more hopeless position than that?
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.580]   Here is just a handful of people and they are very ordinary men. We had there described
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:27.660]   later as illiterate and ignorant men. The Lord of glory goes back to heaven and he leaves
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.780]   his cause and his interest in the hands of these men, fishermen and people like that.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   The Jews were all against them, as they had been against him. The Gentiles were all pagans.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:45.940]   Now there is the position, a handful of people in an entirely hostile and gainsaying world.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.980]   I say nothing could have been worse than that, nothing could have been more difficult. But
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:59.180]   you remember what happened, don't you? When the Holy Ghost came down upon them, they were
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:07.700]   like lions, mighty in power. And very soon they began turning the world upside down.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.580]   And within three centuries, this little sect became the official religion of the great
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:19.340]   Roman Empire. How did it happen? Did they hold commissions of inquiry and investigation?
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:27.020]   No, they did not. They just went on praying, waiting for the promise, the gift of the outpouring
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:33.060]   of the Holy Spirit. And so it has been. I again could take you over the history. Wasn't
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.860]   it like that at the Protestant Reformation? What hope had that one man, Martin Luther,
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:45.700]   just a monk and an unknown monk? Who is he to stand up against all the Church? And fifteen
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.500]   centuries almost, at least a good twelve to thirteen centuries of tradition in the opposite
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.820]   direction. It seems a sheer impertinence this one man gets up and says, "I alone am right
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:02.860]   and you're all wrong." That's what would be said about him today. And yet you see, he
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:08.380]   was a man with whom the Spirit of God had been dealing. And though he was only one man,
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:14.500]   he stood and stood alone, and the Holy Ghost honored him. When the Protestant Reformation
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:20.260]   came in and has continued, well, there it is, I say. It's always been the same.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.400]   Well now then, the question therefore for us to look at hurriedly this morning is this.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.900]   What happens now then when God does hear the cry and the plea and sends forth his blessing?
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.980]   Well now, here it is, I say. Here's the pattern. The details may differ. They do differ. While
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   all revivals in a sense are identical, there are always minor differences. The big thing
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:49.900]   is always the same, but there are individual differences and variations which don't matter.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.860]   It's the central big things that matter. What happens to the Church, first of all, when
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:02.380]   God hears the cry and begins to answer? Well, the first thing clearly is this. The Church
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:13.140]   becomes conscious of a presence and a power in her midst. When the day of Pentecost was
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:21.180]   fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:28.740]   from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.340]   And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:40.980]   And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:52.340]   Spirit gave them utterance. Consciousness of a power and of a presence. Sometimes it
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:19:01.220]   may be physical, even as it was here. The sound of a mighty rushing wind. It isn't
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:07.380]   always physical, but it has often been in revivals. You read the stories and the accounts.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.140]   It doesn't matter who writes them. They will all testify to these things. But what
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:19.620]   they're all always conscious of is sudden awareness of a glorious presence in the midst,
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:27.100]   such as they've never known before, and a sense of power and a sense of glory. This
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:37.740]   place was filled, and so, I say, it always happens. It may be accompanied by phenomena
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:48.100]   as it was here. Cloven tongues as a fire, speaking with tongues. These things are not
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:56.140]   repeated always, sometimes, sometimes not. Sometimes their sense of power and of glory
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.940]   is so great that people are prostrated to the ground because of the glory. As you hear
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.060]   of people when they suddenly get a good bit of news which they hadn't expected, they
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.700]   faint, literally faint, because of the wonderful news. So, when men and women experience this
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:18.380]   glorious presence, sometimes it's too much even for the physical frame.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:24.260]   Well, we mustn't stay with these things, but that's the great thing to emphasize.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:38.420]   There's this sense of God, the presence and the presidency of the Holy Ghost. You read
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:44.780]   the books. Read this reprint of this book by Smeaton on revivals, and there you'll
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.100]   find it. Men give their testimonies at the end. Great men in the church give an account
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:55.940]   of how they had passed through periods of revival in the church, and you'll find that.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.660]   You see, it isn't any longer that they merely believe in God. God becomes a reality. God
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.300]   has come down, as it were, into their midst. And the meeting is taken out of the hands
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:15.820]   of whoever may have been in charge, and the Holy Ghost begins to preside, takes charge,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.340]   and everybody's aware of his presence and of his glory and of his power. That's what
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:27.660]   happened on the day of Pentecost. That is what happens, I say, in some measure and to
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.540]   some extent in every revival that the church has ever known.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:39.340]   But let me hurry to a second thing. The church is given as the result of this great assurance
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.300]   concerning the truth. She doesn't have to investigate the truth, set up a commission
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   to look into it. She's given an absolute certainty about it. That's the thing that
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:59.260]   comes out so clearly, you see, in this story. Now, take these men, these apostles. You remember
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.780]   how a few weeks before, after the crucifixion, they'd been very shaken. They'd been most
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:13.140]   uncertain. They had come to a belief in the Lord Jesus Christ, and they'd come to see
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.540]   that he was the Messiah, but then he was crucified, and they were shattered. They didn't know
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.460]   where they were. You'll find in the last chapter of the Gospel, according to St. John,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.980]   they were just there talking to one another, and Peter suddenly said, "Well, I'm going
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.780]   to fish. I must do something to relieve this. It's too miserable. It's impossible. I go
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.460]   fishing." And the other said, "Very well, we'll come with you." You can't imagine
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:41.620]   a more dejected picture. They were shaken. They were uncertain about everything. Well,
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.260]   then the Lord appeared to them, and he taught them. Ah, yes, and they were in a better condition.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.980]   But you know, it was only after this which happened to them on the day of Pentecost that
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.340]   they were filled with an assurance and with an understanding, and they began to speak
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:02.460]   to the people about the wonderful works of God. Never again was there any doubt. Never
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:10.380]   again was there any difficulty about understanding. Take this man, Peter. Look at that sermon
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.500]   which he preached on that occasion. You see him expounding the Old Testament, showing
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.540]   the meaning of Joel's prophecy. He's got an understanding which he'd never had before.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.740]   Our Lord had taken them through these scriptures, but they'd not seen it clearly. But at last,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:31.860]   he's got it. And here he is with his mind illuminated, his heart moved, and he's speaking
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:40.340]   and expounding and explaining in this extraordinary sermon. Well, this is, again, something that
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:49.700]   is quite invariable in revival. People have no doubt about these things at such times.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:56.140]   They know. They know. That's what they testify to. This is what they say. They say, "I'd
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:01.380]   believed on the Lord Jesus Christ for years, and yet I was assailed by doubt. But from
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:11.820]   that moment I knew. He told me that he loved me, and that he'd given himself for me."
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.220]   Their testimony is that they're more certain of him and of God and of the spiritual realm
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:24.340]   than they are of anything else. That is what happens. There is an immediacy. There is a
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:30.620]   directness. It's no longer indirectly, as it were, by faith. These things are brought
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:39.180]   in a most real way before them. And they're absolutely certain and assured. Now that is,
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:47.300]   I say something again, that is quite universal in experience. The next thing I notice is
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:55.500]   that the church is filled with great joy and a sense of praise. Did you notice the terms
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.140]   there towards the end of the chapter? "And they, continuing daily with one accord in
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:06.100]   the temple and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:15.260]   singleness of heart, praising God and having favour with all the people." You know, that's
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:23.580]   how the Christian church is meant to be. Great joy, great praise to the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:30.060]   and to God, glorying in this great salvation in the new life they'd received and in this
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:39.460]   sense of heaven. Well, it's again but the simple pattern of what has been repeated so
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:46.180]   frequently when God has again poured out his Spirit upon the church, when the Holy Ghost
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.860]   has fallen again. I've often quoted from this pulpit a thing I remember reading in
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:58.100]   the journals of George Whitefield, how he was preaching on one occasion in Cheltenham,
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:04.980]   and he said, "Suddenly the Lord came down amongst us." Do you know anything about
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:10.780]   that, my friend? Do you believe in that sort of thing? Do you believe that's possible?
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.100]   Now George Whitefield at his worst was probably the greatest preacher that this country has
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.620]   ever known, but there were variations you see even in the ministry of George Whitefield.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.500]   There he was preaching in Cheltenham, having a very good service, but suddenly he said,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:34.940]   "The Lord came down amongst us." That's the thing. And it resulted in great joy,
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.140]   praise and thanksgiving. You know when the church is in a state of revival, you don't
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:49.220]   have to exhort people, you can't stop them. They're so filled with joy. Their very
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:56.180]   faces show it. They're transfigured. There is a heavenly look that even comes upon their
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:05.540]   very faces, which is expressive of this joy, this praise. Can't you see, my dear friends,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.940]   that this is the need of the church today? The people are outside. Why are they outside?
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:19.220]   They say, "Well, it's because I know you miserable Christians." They give the impression
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:26.860]   that they're much happier than we are. But when the Holy Ghost has fallen, people are
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.820]   filled with this joy. It's not a superficial, carnal, put-on thing. It's a thing that
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:39.580]   comes from within, the power of the Spirit irradiating the whole personality and giving
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:45.540]   a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory. And then, of course, the other thing I must
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:52.940]   emphasize is this element of worship and of thanksgiving with great freedom. We read that
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:59.980]   "All then they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:06.260]   in breaking of bread and prayers, and all that believed were together, and they continuing
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:12.380]   daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:19.620]   with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favour with all the people."
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   Worship, thanksgiving. Have you read the stories of revivals? This is what you'll find.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.100]   Once this happens, you see, you don't have to exhort people to come together to worship
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:35.020]   and to praise and to consider the Word. They insist upon it. They come night after night
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.180]   and they miss the hours until the early hours of the morning. It'll go on night after
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.540]   night after night for months, exactly as they did here at the beginning. They met daily.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:49.060]   They couldn't keep away from one another. Of course not. This marvellous thing had happened,
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.020]   this joy of the Lord, and they wanted to thank him together and to pray together, to ask
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:01.140]   him to spread it and to do it to others. This worship and thanksgiving and praise, you know,
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:08.100]   if this happens to the Church, the world outside will be astonished. It'll be amazed, as
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:13.500]   it always has been, in every period of revival and reawakening. This is what is needed, not
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.820]   to exhort to doubtful worldly methods to try and get crowds and bring people together.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:24.700]   No, no. This inward urge, this constraint of the Spirit, this coming together of men
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.180]   and women who are sharing in the same glorious experience.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.780]   And then the last thing I would notice this morning about what happens to the Church is
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:41.660]   the power and the boldness that is given in the proclamation of the truth. Look at this
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:48.900]   man, Peter. It's but a few weeks before that he was so fearful and so much the victim of
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:54.540]   a craven spirit that he even denied the Lord Jesus Christ to that servant maid in order
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:01.100]   to save his life. Here he is now, preaching in Jerusalem. He knows the authorities are
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:07.220]   watching him and listening to him. And he tells them quite plainly and in no uncertain
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.780]   language what they have done in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "Him being
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:20.340]   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God you have taken and by wicked hands
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.580]   have crucified and slain." He repeated it again. You'll find the account in the next
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:31.740]   chapter. Here he is speaking again to the same people. He says, "The God of Abram and
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:37.780]   of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.540]   up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go. But
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.860]   ye denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:55.580]   the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead. He attacked them and their rulers
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.260]   and governors. He is not afraid of them any longer, nor of the whole world. Let hell be
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:06.220]   let loose. He is filled with a holy boldness and he bears witness to the resurrection and
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:15.700]   proclaims the truth of God without fear and without favour." And again, that is invariable
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:22.780]   in the history of revival. That is what happens to the whole Church. That is what happens
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:29.940]   to individuals. You are all interested in D. L. Moody. Well, that is what he said. He
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:35.840]   said that after his experience of thus having the Holy Ghost shed forth upon him, this baptism
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.060]   with the Spirit, he said, "I went on preaching the same old sermons as I had been preaching
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.180]   before." But he said they were absolutely different. And they were. And they were different
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:50.260]   in their results. The same sermons, and yet they were not the same sermons. There was
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:56.580]   this demonstration of the Spirit and of power. It is the same with all others.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.140]   Well now, then, there are the things that happen to the Church at such a time. Let me
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:06.540]   say just a word before I close about what happens to the world that is outside. The
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:11.700]   Church, experiencing this, you see, is now concerned about the world outside. So it prays
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.340]   for the world outside. It preaches to the world outside. It is concerned about it. And
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.000]   what happens? Well, the first thing we are told is that the world outside becomes attracted
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.220]   by curiosity. And they were dwelling at Jerusalem, "Jews, devout men out of every nation under
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.780]   heaven." Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:39.460]   A great crowd gathered. They said, "What is this?"
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:45.340]   You see, the problem confronting the Church today is, what can we do with these masses
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.880]   that are outside the Church? And you see, their way of solving it is, "Let us set
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.980]   up commissions to investigate." We will have a commission to investigate what we are
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.820]   to preach to them. Then we will have another commission to investigate how we are to preach
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.800]   the problem of communication they govern. This problem of communication. How can we
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.940]   get people to listen, as if there had never been a problem of communication until this
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:11.820]   generation? But it has always been there. It was there at the beginning. What are we
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.580]   to do about these masses? How can we get them together? What can we do? Can we put on some
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   sort of show to attract them? Can we put on something bright and gay? And can we sort
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.820]   of start, as I once heard in a conference, they started with comic songs and then they
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:33.100]   became a little bit more serious until eventually they came to hymns. Is that the method?
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:41.740]   My dear friends, if you want to get a crowd in your churches, pray for revival. Because
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.200]   the moment a revival breaks out, the crowd will come. And I'll tell you another thing,
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:53.080]   it won't cost you a penny. I am speaking to the Church that is spending thousands of
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:34:00.980]   pounds on advertising, advertising to try and attract the outsider. The moment you get
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:06.660]   revival, the newspapers will report it. Their motive, of course, will be quite wrong. They
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.660]   will do it because they don't like it, because they think it's ridiculous, because they think
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.940]   that people have gone mad or that they're drunk. Doesn't matter. They'll give it a
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.700]   free advertisement. And the crowds will come to see what's happening, as they did on the
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:30.460]   Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem. The crowd gathered together. Oh, what fools we are. It's our
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:37.820]   cleverness that's our undoing, you know. We think we can do it. When will we wake up
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:45.980]   to realize we cannot, but that the Holy Ghost can? He even does that part of it for us.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:51.860]   And then they came along, of course, as I say, skeptical and contemptuous. These men
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.220]   are full of new wine, that's the trouble with these. But Peter stood up and said, "These
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.700]   men are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. Use your
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.780]   common sense." He says, "How can they be drunk at this hour of the day, apart from
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.860]   anything else?" But he says, "That's a negative. The positive thing is this. This
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:14.760]   is that which was spoken by the prophet John." And he began to preach. And here he is going
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.980]   on with his sermon. Men and brethren, he says in his application, "Let me speak freely
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:26.580]   unto you of the patriarch David." And on he goes with his sermon. "Therefore," he
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:33.140]   says, "let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:44.740]   whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ." Then listen. "Now when they heard this, they
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.620]   were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Men
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:56.460]   and brethren, what shall we do?'" You see, Peter had not arrived at the end of the
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.420]   sermon, he hadn't finished. Before he had arrived at the end of the sermon, they cried
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.300]   out. He didn't finish his sermon and then have a hymn and say, "Now we come to the
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.180]   appeal," and try to get them to come forward. Not at all. Before he had finished preaching,
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.660]   they were crying out and saying, "What shall we do?" There was no need to test the meeting.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   The Holy Ghost had done it. People were so deeply convicted of sin, so humbled and broken
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.900]   and alarmed and terrified, that they interrupt the sermon and cry out saying, "Men and
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.780]   brethren, what shall we do?" They're in an agony of soul, this profound conviction
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:37.940]   of sin. That's the story of every revival. There is always that kind of interruption,
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:44.940]   almost a disorder, what somebody called a divine disorder. And then, of course, that
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:52.380]   in turn, you see, leads to repentance. "Oh," says Peter, "repent and be baptized, every
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.740]   one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." And they
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:02.980]   did. It isn't a mere question of decision when you have a revival. It's deep repentance.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:10.860]   It's reformation. They receive a new life and they leave the old life. You know, when
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.540]   you get a revival, the whole neighborhood is changed. Public houses are shut. The moral
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.020]   conditions are revolutionized. Read the stories. These are facts. This isn't my idea. This
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:30.340]   isn't theory. I'm speaking factual matter. The statistics are there. The whole moral
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:36.700]   condition is changed. When you get revival, when the Holy Spirit is doing his own work,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.300]   not only do individuals give up drink and so on, public houses are shut. Men's businesses
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.540]   are ruined. There was actually a case in Northern Ireland a hundred years ago of a publican
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.420]   who himself was converted. He went to the meeting because all his customers had left
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:57.100]   him. There was nobody to serve in his public house. So he went and said, "What is this
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:04.100]   nonsense?" And there he was converted himself and he became a preacher of the gospel. That's
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:16.340]   revival. A true heart repentance. A forsaking of sin. Newness of life manifesting itself
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:23.180]   in an entirely new department. And they joined the church. It was not a case of temporary
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:29.060]   decisions. They joined the church. They were added to the church. The churches were built
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:38.260]   up and they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.420]   and prayer. Do you know, as a result of the revival of a hundred years ago, the number
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.460]   of chapels that had to be built was quite phenomenal? I happen to know the facts concerning
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.740]   the sales. I've got to go and preach at a centenary of a building of a chapel in next
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:59.580]   September. There are many others. They all had to be built because of so many being converted
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:05.740]   and joining the churches. Adding to the church from those who were entirely outside. Not
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.300]   that those who were already in the church were given some new Philip. No, no. The people
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:17.140]   who were outside came in, converted and changed, added to the church. I've already given you
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:25.900]   some of the statistics with respect to the various countries. And there you see is the
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.420]   very thing we are told the church needs today. Membership going down, Sunday schools going
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:39.500]   down, everything going down. Shutting chapels, trying to group them together. Therefore your
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:48.460]   commissions to do this and that, we want to get the people in. Here's the answer. Here's
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:58.980]   the infallible, the certain way. The falling down of the Holy Ghost upon the church. The
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:08.820]   shedding forth of the Spirit of God again. The church being given a new baptism of power
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:18.940]   and authority and ability to witness and to preach. Can more be said? Don't you see
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:25.980]   it all here? That's how God started the church. That is how God has continued to keep
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.700]   the church alive. When in the hands of men she has almost died so often, God has again
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:39.180]   done this selfsame thing. He's repeated his original action. And the Moribund church
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:48.500]   has risen to a new period of life and activity and power. Isn't this the supreme need at
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:56.580]   this hour? Well, if you believe that, pray to God without ceasing. Go on with all your
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.860]   activities if you like. Go on with your work. I'm not saying that you should stop doing
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.780]   everything and just wait. No, no. Go on if you like doing all you're doing. But I do
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:11.900]   say this. Make certain that you leave time to pray for revival and to see that that has
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:22.300]   more time than anything else. Because when the Holy Ghost falls, more happens in an hour
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.620]   than will happen as a result of your exertions and mine in fifty years or even a hundred
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:33.900]   years. The power of the Holy Ghost. That's the meaning of the day of Pentecost. That's
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:42.620]   the meaning of Whitsun. The power of God coming down. And in such a manner that the apostles
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.460]   were amazed even as Peter was, you see, in preaching to the house of Cornelius. There
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.380]   he was again halfway through his sermon. Down came the Holy Ghost and Peter could scarcely
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.940]   believe it. He didn't believe that Gentiles could come in. He'd argued when he'd been
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.220]   given the vision on the housetop, you remember. He couldn't believe it. But he said, "When
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.180]   I saw that God had done to them what he did to us at the beginning, who was I that I could
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:17.100]   refuse to baptize them?" Pray God to have pity and to have mercy and to shed forth again
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:23.140]   his blessed Holy Spirit upon us. Amen.
