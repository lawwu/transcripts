[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.380]   The moderator for this year's Q&A with the experts panel is my good friend and Bogoheads
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.600]   conference team member Mel Turner.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   Many of you know him as Tom, which stands for the other Mel because the two of us is
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.840]   very confusing.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.880]   Mel is a retired airline pilot.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.720]   He's a fellow Marine who flew A-4 Skyhawks over South Vietnam and Laos.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   He has flown all over the world and his last assignment was flying Boeing 757 and 767s
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.920]   out of Philadelphia to Europe.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   While his employment was as a professional pilot, his avocation was the world of finance.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.080]   He bought the first mutual funds in 1978 and made his first investment in Vanguard in 1978.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.240]   Jack Bogo continues to be his financial hero.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.920]   He's read hundreds of books on the subject and was thrilled when he ran across the San
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.760]   Diego chapter of the Bogoheads.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.040]   At age 68, he decided to jump into the certified financial planning program at UCLA where he
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.080]   finished 78 classes while maintaining an A average.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.840]   He sees his mission now as returning his good fortunes in good Bogoheads fashion by helping
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.420]   others with their finances.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.440]   When not traveling, he resides in San Diego with his wife, Kathy, and spends about four
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.680]   months a year in Maui.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:55.440]   Please welcome my good friend, Mel Turner.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.960]   Well welcome to all the first timers.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.500]   Welcome here for all the other people that have been here before.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   Welcome back.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.800]   We hope you enjoy the conference that's here.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.960]   So I asked for questions to everybody.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.800]   I got 22 pages, single space questions, hundreds and hundreds of questions.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   And I went through them.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.200]   I apologize that all of the questions aren't going to be available.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.040]   I tried to get one's all levels of expertise from beginners to advanced, from people just
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.340]   starting out to people that are in retirement.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.480]   So I hope it covers the spectrum.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.720]   I had to overlook some of them.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.120]   Peggy, I've given your question to Mike Piper for Social Security so you can see him if
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.980]   you can work your way through the crowd that surrounds him wherever he travels in the place.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.280]   I'm not going to be able to answer the questions about how to finance your remodeling project
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   or how to invest if there's a nuclear holocaust.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.000]   That's a true question that I received.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.280]   So although I'll ask a question, I ask all the panelists to go ahead and respond and
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   interact with each other.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   This year it was different.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.920]   Last year it was like technical questions, like how does an IRA operate and the rest
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   of that.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.040]   This year there was more behavioral and discipline and emotional kind of things.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160]   It was interesting in the questions.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.240]   So the panel, we're very fortunate to have them.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.880]   We're all here to honor Jack, of course, and we're here to learn something.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.720]   But as you learn something, hopefully you'll take it out and help other people.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.800]   One more note, everybody here pays the same.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   The panelists paid 275.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.440]   I pay 275 as Mel pays 275.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.760]   There's only one person that doesn't pay.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.000]   Guess who that is?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.860]   So our first panelist is a cofounder of Efficient Frontier Advisors and author of several successful
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400]   titles on finance and economic history.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.200]   My favorite is the Pillars of Investing.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.080]   Please welcome the real Boglehead favorite, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.240]   Our next panelist is a Morningstar director of personal finance and a senior columnist
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.200]   at Morningstar, one of the better financial interviewers that I've ever seen.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.920]   Please welcome Christine Benz.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.080]   Next on the panel is Jonathan Clements.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.400]   Our next panelist is the first Boglehead conference, but hopefully it won't be his last.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.820]   He's an author at the Wall Street Journal, former author at the Wall Street Journal and
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.320]   a Boglehead favorite.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.520]   And just on a personal note, I have to say that Jonathan inspired me.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.920]   He inspired me so much that I have a four-inch binder of stuff that he used to do in the
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.480]   Wall Street Journal from 1997.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   I've saved it.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.320]   And I thought I was the crazy one and somebody walked up and said, "You know, I have a binder
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   of his stuff too."
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:59.240]   So please welcome Jonathan Clements.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.200]   Our next panelist is a CFA and professor of retirement income, a Ph.D. program for financial
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.680]   and retirement planning at the American College of Bryn Mawr.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.600]   Please welcome Dr. Wade Fowle.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.720]   Next panelist is a Missouri CPA and the author of several books, 11 books, a blog, Oblivious
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.320]   Investor, award-winning blog.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.380]   He also does digital books.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:38.440]   My favorite is Social Security Made Easy, but please welcome Mike Piper.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.940]   Our next panelist, I ran across a quote, he says, "My professional goal is to never be
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.160]   confused with Jim Cramer."
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.700]   Our next panelist is a founder of WealthLogic.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.640]   He's an author and contributed to AARP Financial Planning Magazine, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.240]   Please welcome Alan Roth.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.860]   So the first question is in honor of Taylor Laramore.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.040]   He sent me an email and requested that I submit this question, so this question is for him.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.680]   You know how we always bump into somebody that's 20 to 25 years old and we've got like
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.120]   15 or 20 seconds to be able to influence them?
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.480]   His question is for the whole panel, what is the single most important financial advice
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:30.560]   you would give to a new investor?
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.080]   I can put this in Twitter form.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:44.140]   Minimize expenses and emotions, maximize diversification and discipline.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.780]   People aren't as smart as they think they are, and using a very simple portfolio instead
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.120]   of trying something fancy is perfectly fine.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.640]   And I think I'm just going to reiterate what two other panelists said.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.120]   If somebody asks me for financial advice, go and buy a talk-of-date retirement fund
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   with expenses below 20 basis points, contribute to it regularly and hang onto it for the rest
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.720]   of your life and you'll be very happy.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.260]   Well, a follow-up with that, would you recommend a talk-of-date retirement fund or a life strategy
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.180]   fund or build a three-portfolio fund?
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.360]   If somebody's starting out, a talk-of-date retirement fund where you don't have to actually
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.160]   worry about three different parts of the portfolio seems like a very good idea.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.280]   That way you're not going to get unnerved because U.S. stocks have a bad year and foreign
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.380]   stocks have a good year and you think about swapping around.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.640]   If you buy that talk-of-date fund, all you have is a single share price to look at each
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.960]   day, and that's going to hide a lot of the mess that's going on underneath the hood.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.360]   Plus, you know, a talk-of-date retirement fund is going to rebalance for you every year.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.940]   You don't have to worry about that part of it either, which you would have to with a
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.060]   three-fund portfolio.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.880]   Just to accentuate Jonathan's point on that, we have this investor return data, which is
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.340]   dollar-weighted return data that looks at the timing of investors' cash flows, and the
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.100]   goal is to capture investors' actual return experience.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.500]   What we see when we look at the target date universe is a really beautiful thing in terms
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.560]   of investors buying these funds and staying the course and really capturing the returns
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.820]   that they earn.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.660]   We've been puzzling over why that is.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.460]   It might just be something to do with the 401(k) setting where a lot of target date
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.480]   buyers are 401(k) buyers, and so they have their investments on autopilot.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.940]   But whatever it is that's working for target date funds, it appears to be really good from
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.620]   a behavioral standpoint, so I would underscore the virtue of that one-stop vehicle, certainly
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.620]   for accumulators.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:47.380]   And the only thing that I would add to that is, if at all possible, don't ever look at
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.660]   your account balance.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.500]   Someone else should to make sure that no one's committing fraud on it, but you shouldn't
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.420]   know what it is.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.500]   One - I mean, this is a minor point - but one thing I like about the life strategy funds
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.380]   relative to the target retirement funds is that they force you to think about your personal
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.940]   risk tolerance a little bit.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.300]   You have to actively choose whether you want a more aggressive allocation or a more conservative
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.940]   one.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.420]   That said, I have no qualms whatsoever about recommending a target date fund to somebody
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.620]   if it's low cost.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.460]   I'm sure that Alan is going to compete vigorously for being the most controversial person on
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.580]   this panel, but I'd like to at least get an early head start.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.540]   I think that when you look at services like Betterment and Wealthfront, where they're
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:45.220]   charging you 25 basis points or more in order to get a portfolio index fund, and all they're
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:53.380]   offering you over and above a target date retirement fund is tax loss harvesting, why
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.060]   would you pay that 25 basis points?
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.980]   A lot of people who are enrolling in Betterment and Wealthfront are people in low tax brackets
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.980]   anyway.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.340]   Often they're buying within retirement accounts.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.020]   It seems to me like anybody who's drawn to Betterment and Wealthfront would be a lot
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.980]   better off buying a target date retirement fund that begins with the letter V.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:21.500]   I hate to agree with Jonathan after what he just said about that, but even at 25 bps,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.540]   they have to add some complexities to them.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.180]   Now they're getting into factor based smart beta types of things, which is not a free
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   lunch.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   Guess what?
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:38.100]   Large cap growth has been the strongest performing part of the market, not the smart beta hasn't
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.380]   been so smart lately.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.580]   The next question was asked by four different people, so I'll just combine them into the
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.580]   same.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.000]   There's a little fear out there.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.120]   Stock markets are hitting record high interest rates or record lows.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.260]   This is from Trey Parrish and Steve Bruns.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.260]   He says, "The million dollar question for every retail investor who is asking, with
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.420]   the stock market all times higher, interest rates all time low, cash returning 1%, endless
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.860]   market optimism, no fear, where should an investor put capital?
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.940]   It's easy to say stay the course when you look back at eight years of a bull market,"
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:28.880]   he quotes, "but come on, in 10 years, am I really going to get any material returns?"
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.260]   First of all, interest rates are not at an all time low.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.880]   You could go back to 1980, you could earn 12% on a CD, Treasury, guess what?
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.180]   Inflation was 15%.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.540]   So I've always argued the purpose of fixed income isn't actually income.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.420]   It's the stable part of your portfolio.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.460]   Who knows what equity returns will be in the future, but stick to an asset allocation.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.580]   If you can't be right, at least be consistent.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:07.200]   Yeah, I mean, there are a couple of different ways to look at that.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.100]   Let's assume we're now at the 10th anniversary, pretty close, of the last market high right
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.900]   before the global financial crisis.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   Stocks have still been the place to be over the past 10 years, even starting from that
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.900]   point.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.660]   The S&Ps returned, I think, something like 7% annualized.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.540]   Since then, the worst case scenario is foreign stocks, which returned maybe 2%.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:36.960]   That's still better than bonds, or at least better than short bonds and CDs.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.320]   So that's one way to look at it.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.700]   Another way to look at it is if you're rebalancing, you're probably doing some selling of stocks
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.700]   right now.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:53.360]   And even if you're in a saving process, if you're using a value averaging path and just
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.200]   keeping yourself at a fixed allocation as you put money in, you're probably just putting
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.780]   new money into bonds right now.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:11.020]   So I don't really see that there's much of an issue, at least in the long term.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.000]   Your starting point in building a portfolio is the global market portfolio.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.060]   The global market portfolio is roughly divided into four components-- US stocks, US bonds,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.480]   foreign stocks, foreign bonds.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.960]   And I would say that if I was wearing my market strategist hat, which I don't wear comfortably,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.480]   you could argue that three of those four are relatively expensive.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:39.520]   The one area of the global markets that is not so expensive are foreign stocks.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.280]   And what I would say is, if you're massively overweighted in any one of those four sectors,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.320]   in terms of three of them-- US stocks, US bonds, and foreign bonds-- you could have
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.400]   an unhappy outcome.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.580]   So make sure that you own at least a portion of-- you spread pretty widely among those
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.800]   four, so that if one of them has a really bad outcome over the next 10 years, you're
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.680]   not too unhappy, and you don't end up with the retirement you don't want.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.600]   I just mentioned, too, about how the problem changes a little bit when you get to retirement
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.640]   and you start taking distributions, that that will really amplify the impact of investment
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   volatility.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.120]   And at this point, with the market run-ups, you may be ahead of schedule, as Bill says.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.440]   If you've already won the game, stop playing.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.880]   So if you are getting to the stage where you're going to be taking distributions from your
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.800]   assets for retirement, this is a good opportunity to think about locking in some of those gains,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.720]   moving some of that into individual bonds to cover short-term retirement expenses, or
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.040]   even simple income annuities that will provide that lifetime income.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.400]   Yeah, I would agree with that.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.320]   I write a lot about this bucket approach, and I know some of you agree with it.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.400]   Some of you don't agree with it.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:56.280]   But the basic idea is, if you are looking for cash flows from your portfolio in this
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.040]   very low-yield environment, your best source of cash flows, if you're retired, if you have
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.740]   equities in your portfolio, are hiding in plain sight, and that's selling some of your
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.000]   equity position down and filling up some of the positions in safer assets.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.280]   So I think that that strategy makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   There's often this temptation when we have these little bouts of market volatility, and
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.320]   we haven't had many recently at all, but people sort of rush to say, "Everyone should sit
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   tight.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   No one should sell."
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   And I think, you know what?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.640]   In the past few years when we've had these little shocks in the market, use those as
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.960]   impetus to sell as kind of a wake-up call of what it can feel like when things are falling.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:44.800]   I apologize if I'm stating the obvious here, but when expected returns are low, asset allocation
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   only goes so far to solve the problem.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   Often what you need to be thinking about is saving more if you're in the saving stage,
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.720]   or spending less if you're in retirement.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.320]   Asset allocation can help, but think about other things, too.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:09.920]   I hesitate to utter the word "Social Security" in Mike's presence, but there's another thing
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   here which is unsaid.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.480]   I think it's obvious to everybody up here, but just to state the obvious, which is that
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.920]   before you buy a TIPS ladder, before you buy an annuity, spend down your retirement assets
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.840]   so that you can defer Social Security until 70.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.880]   That is the best annuity that money can buy.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.520]   Okay, so the next question has with overweighting different asset classes.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.720]   Four different responses, or five different questions about this.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.080]   Joel Goodman says, "Does investing in dividend aristocrats provide some kind of a downside
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.320]   protection?"
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.800]   Trey wants to know, "Why don't I buy some high-dividend stocks to protect myself?"
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.040]   Steve Lelulio says, "How would you allocate emerging markets as a percentage of your total
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   international assets?"
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.320]   In fact, I think Jonathan wrote an article endorsing emerging markets, and from Brent
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:08.440]   Hunsberger, "Is there a value premium still, and if yes, how would you convince an investor
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   of that?"
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.040]   So they're all about overweighting different sectors of the market.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.960]   How do you feel about that?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.760]   Bill.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:29.080]   Gosh, well, let me do the last two, which are emerging markets and then factor tilts.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.640]   Emerging markets, the conventional wisdom is that about 10% of your equity portfolio,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.760]   so if you're 60, 40, 6% of your total portfolio should be in emerging markets.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.560]   I've always thought that's a little high, and the thing I like to say about emerging
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.520]   markets stocks is the nice thing about them is that from time to time they get to be really
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.560]   cheap.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.600]   This is actually one of those times.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:00.140]   They're still probably the least expensive segment of the equity markets around the world.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.680]   So I mean, I think now is the time to maintain a good weighting in emerging market stocks.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.600]   Factor tilts, again, that's almost completely an imponderable.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.140]   It's a risk premium, and it's probably more of a risk premium now than it ever was.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.960]   And the risk is that you're going to underperform the market, which in fact value stocks have
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.560]   done over something like the past 10 years.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:35.200]   And the other problem is that everybody else is chasing that factor as well.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.800]   It was the case 20 years ago, there was really only one company that chased it well, and
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   that was DFA.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.440]   And now there are other companies that do it, so there's more capital that's thrown
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.980]   up against it, that's thrown into it, and I think the returns are going to be lower.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.200]   And so I think that whatever advantage the factor tilt had over just owning the total
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.320]   stock market is less than it was.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.800]   I think it's still there, but I'm less enthusiastic than I was about it 20 years ago.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.560]   Hey, Bill, can I ask you a follow-up question on the EM issue?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.760]   Because I have heard this, that EM emerging markets may be cheap relative to the rest
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   of the world.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.360]   But I guess the thing I wonder about is if we're concerned about the U.S. market maybe
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:20.000]   being a little expensive and potentially subject to some volatility, I mean, since when does
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.360]   emerging markets not tumble when the U.S. market tumbles?
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.780]   That's my concern about recommending that people look at EM.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780]   That's a good point.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:36.080]   There's no question that if the S&P 500 goes down 5% tomorrow, the emerging markets indexes
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.040]   will be down by a lot more than that.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.400]   And if that's your definition of risk, then they are certainly riskier, and that's certainly
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   a concern.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:52.840]   I view risk in a very sort of Spockian sort of manner, at least I try to, which is long-term
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   risk.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.800]   So that when I look at, say, the 10-year period, the most awful 10-year period you could possibly
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:06.600]   imagine, which would be the one between, let's say, 2000 and -- excuse me, 2000 -- well,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:13.320]   1999 and 2008, all right, it's a 10-year period, you had two awful bear markets in there, and
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.440]   you found that emerging market stocks, although they tumbled something like 65 or 67% from
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.040]   top to bottom from '07 to '09, over that whole 10-year period, emerging market stocks had
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:29.800]   triple-digit total returns, all right, whereas the S&P 500 lost 20%.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   So I think that in the short term, you're right about valuations.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.720]   In the long -- over the very long term, if you're looking at long-term risk, I think
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   valuations are what drive risk, and that valuation risk in emerging market stocks right now,
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.040]   I think, is a lot lower than it is in U.S. stocks.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:55.440]   In other words, I think we're set up for another period that may look like from 1999 to 2008.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.640]   So are you saying we should overweight emerging markets or keep our allocation the same?
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.600]   I'm saying that perhaps 10% of your total equity portfolio is not inappropriate right
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.120]   now, and, you know, if they do really bounce back, you should probably look to trimming
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   that back.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.240]   Boy, is that a non-Boglehead thing to say, but yeah.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.400]   You know, I may be disagreeing in public with the smartest guy on the planet, but, you know,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.240]   I charge $450 an hour to tell people that I don't know the future, and it's really good
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   advice.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.680]   I did not know that international was going to outperform the U.S. this year, and if I
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.080]   had had a crystal ball knowing what's going on with North Korea right now, I would have
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.280]   avoided the Korean stock market, and South Korea I think may be the single best-performing
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:52.000]   emerging, well, depending upon whether you call it emerging or developed markets, because
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.800]   the Vanguard emerging market doesn't have South Korea, but predicting the future is
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:04.220]   a really hard thing to do, and like I said, small-cap value, the factor tilting, more
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:11.840]   money has poured into cap-weighted indexing, even on a percentage basis, than what Vanguard
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:20.200]   calls, I'm sorry, what Morningstar calls fundamental index, or strategic beta, smart beta in other
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   words.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:28.280]   So money tends to flow to whatever has done better, and that consistency is incredibly
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.720]   important, and again, that means you have to sell.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.080]   I had to be buying international in spite of what Jack was telling me, and Jack, I think
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:43.560]   the world of you, but just stick to owning the world and owning, I would say, three out
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:52.000]   of four of those sectors, I still think international bond, even with Vanguard's product, is expensive.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.200]   Just to put a quick plug in for emerging markets, I mean, the reason that I'm such a fan of
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:03.600]   emerging markets, and I would encourage people to have at least a market weight holding,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.120]   is because of demographics, and as people say, demographics are destiny.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.880]   If you look at the U.S. economy, historically, we've had 3% real economic growth, 1.5% of
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.560]   that has come from increasing the size of the civilian workforce each year, and the
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.480]   other 1.5% has come from productivity gains.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.680]   We already know what the story looks like for the years ahead, it's about 0.5% a year
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:32.320]   in terms of growth in the civilian workforce, versus 1.5% over the past 50 years.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.800]   That means that we're going to lose one percentage point out of economic growth.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.920]   I don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, or you're not meant to talk about
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.080]   politics on this panel, economic growth is going to be slower.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.320]   We're going to get something very close to 2% long run economic growth, not the 3%, and
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.760]   all the political promises in the world are not going to make any difference to that.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   By contrast, if you look at emerging markets, their demographic problems lie roughly 60
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.480]   years into the future.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.720]   I don't know whether I'm going to be out of emerging markets by then, but I think I will
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.240]   be gone from this earth.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.560]   So at least for the rest of my life, emerging markets seem like they should have a permanent
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   part of my portfolio.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.840]   Okay, thanks.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.400]   The next question is going to be aimed at Dr. Wade Fowl since he studies this subject.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.600]   Studies show that people are not saving up enough.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.760]   This is from Mel Turner.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   I think I know that guy.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.800]   He says, "Average savings accumulated at 65 is around $100,000.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.680]   Defined benefit plans are being phased out, only 14% of the people are covered.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.880]   Average workers contribute half of what they should be contributing.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.840]   Social security is unsustainable.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.560]   The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College states that 53% of the working age
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.040]   households were at risk of having inadequate retirement resources.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.280]   So what's the outcome of this?
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.160]   How does this end?"
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.960]   Yeah, that's a great question, and I do tend to focus more on the people that have been
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   saving.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.920]   But in terms of solutions for the Americans who haven't been saving enough as they should
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.280]   have been, part-time work to the extent that that's possible will help to fill some of
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   the gap.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.760]   And then the two major assets for American households are their social security benefits
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.320]   and their home equity.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.480]   And they just need to really make sure that they make good decisions on both with at least
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   a high earner generally delaying social security to 70.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:37.320]   And then with home equity, just thinking about how to, for example, with a reverse mortgage,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.440]   be able to include that as part of the retirement income plan and help support some retirement
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.120]   spending from that.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.560]   Otherwise it is going to be tough.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.240]   A lot of Americans will simply be living on their social security benefits.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.780]   And at some point there may be some cutbacks, although I think it's way too dramatic to
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.120]   assume zero social security benefits in the future, as I know is a common rule of thumb
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120]   for planning.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.240]   But no, it's going to be tough and people will struggle.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.920]   Anybody else on the panel have an opinion about how it ends?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.640]   Bill, you study this kind of stuff.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   Not well.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:25.320]   You mentioned the Center for Retirement Research, that's Alicia Manel's group at Boston College.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.720]   And they've had this at-risk index for the past three decades.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.200]   It started out somewhere around, what, 33 or 35 percent were at risk.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.280]   Now it's 53 percent.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.040]   And if that sounds bad enough, you have to realize the algorithm they use to arrive at
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.680]   that number, which is they assume that when everybody retires, they take all their retirement
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.840]   assets and they annuitize them.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.800]   And it also assumes that they reverse mortgage their homes.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.080]   So that at-risk percentage is almost certainly much higher than 53 percent.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:05.040]   So it doesn't end well.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.800]   This is sort of an alternative universe within the bounds of this room.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.120]   But outside of this room, it's not going to be pretty at all.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.740]   I read somewhere that there's going to be three trends.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.920]   People are going to work longer, and you've already seen that.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.200]   Another one, they're going to turn to annuities as they start to panic because they can guarantee
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.000]   income and reverse mortgages is probably the third one, it's what I read.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.280]   So here's a question from Ron Mason.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.960]   And it was also discussed at our last San Diego Boglehead meeting.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.280]   It has to do with how much in an emergency fund.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.480]   It says the usual amount is three to six months of expenses, although some people are saying
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.700]   they have even a year or two years of cash.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.040]   How do you determine the amount that should be kept?
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:54.720]   And should you consider your Roth IRA as an emergency fund?
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.400]   >> I can take a stab at that one.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.440]   Three to six months is the -- I remember that's the rule of thumb I learned in the CFP coursework.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.960]   But the fact of life is that for higher income earners, people with more specialized career
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:14.220]   paths, I think it makes sense to take that higher because it will likely take a longer
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.560]   time to replace that higher earning, more specialized job if it's lost.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:26.200]   And another group that I think needs to think about this emergency funding is the gig economy
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.720]   workers, which I'm sure we all know someone who's working as a contractor or is not a
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.120]   full-time employee somewhere.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.000]   And if you know any of these folks, chances are you know that they can have long work
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.400]   interruptions, that when they are working, that their work may be very lucrative, but
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.120]   they may have long periods where they're out of work.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.000]   So that constituency, too, I think should think about having a larger cushion, certainly
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.880]   than three to six months.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.920]   Regarding the idea of whether a Roth IRA could be used in sort of a multitasking way, this
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.120]   is something I've written about.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:07.640]   I think it actually can be a neat idea for a young accumulator to think about the having
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.840]   at least part of the emergency fund stashed within the Roth IRA.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.920]   Best case scenario, you never touch it, but it's there and can be tapped without penalties
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.120]   or taxes if they need it.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.240]   So it's something to think about.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.800]   I think you just need to think about what that money gets invested in.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.640]   And so if that's your plan to stash part of your emergency fund in the Roth IRA, you need
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.240]   to make sure that that money isn't in long term assets, that if you needed to invade
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.280]   it in a pinch, that you wouldn't be selling stuff or run the risk of selling stuff when
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.240]   it's down.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.960]   I think the answer is it depends.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:53.040]   And if you're a tenured professor at a university, a federal employee, have a very stable job,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.400]   you need less than if you're working for a startup company, where your employment may
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.620]   end in a day.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:07.040]   As far as Roth, and by the way, it's not cash, it's access to cash that you need for that
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.320]   emergency.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.160]   And on the Roth, I mean, versus living under a bridge, yes, I would tap the Roth, but the
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   Roth is the last money you want to spend.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.320]   Just a few quick comments on this, four things.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   One is we always talk about emergency funds.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.520]   It's not an emergency fund.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.140]   It's an unemployment fund.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.640]   Any other financial emergency you can think of, you cover it.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.840]   The dishwasher breaks, you put it on your credit card, you pay it off when the bill
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   arrives.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.560]   If you have to get a new car, you get the insurance proceeds, you add a little bit of
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.160]   your own money and you buy it.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.720]   An emergency fund is an unemployment fund.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.900]   Second, we're talking about covering, not replicating your income, but replicating your
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.400]   living expenses.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.000]   So the lower your living expenses, if you're a frugal boglehead, the smaller the emergency
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   fund you need.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.960]   Figure out what your fixed living costs are each month, and then you keep three to six
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.840]   months of that, depending upon the risk of your human capital, which Alan just mentioned.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:11.320]   Third, as we grow older, we tend to accumulate assets in our regular taxable account.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.480]   At that point, if you've got $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 sitting in your regular taxable account,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.520]   what's the point in having a separate emergency fund?
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.340]   I'm not sure there is any point at that juncture.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.960]   And four, and this actually gets some heat on this, but I'm not sure why, given that
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.680]   an emergency fund is really an unemployment fund, why anybody who is retired would have
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.540]   an emergency fund.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:43.040]   What job are you going to lose?
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.520]   Anyone else?
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.720]   The next question is similar to the one that Tater asked, and it's from Stuart Halpert,
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.560]   and it just happened to us the other day.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.940]   Kathy likes the aisle and I like the window, and the guy that sat between us is 26 years
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.580]   old, and he said, "Where are you going?"
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.900]   I'm going to an investment conference, and boy, it set him off.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.660]   He starts talking about expense ratios, and the next thing he starts talking about, I'm
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.780]   buying stock now, and I made money here, and I made money here, and I said, "Do you know
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.060]   the stock market goes down sometimes?" but he, 26, he had never seen it go down.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.260]   It was only up, and I just went through my head, what do I say to him, you know, to convince
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   him?
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   So this is from Stuart Halpert.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   He says, "This is a toughie.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.820]   If you have to make an elevator pitch, that is, you have about 45 seconds or less to sell
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:39.120]   passive investing as compared to active investing, better known as a dark side, what do you say?"
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.240]   So consider yourself coming down the Empire State Building.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.840]   You can take as much time as you want, but if you could give some feedback on that.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:55.320]   I would say your odds are about the same as being obese, smoking three packs of cigarettes
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:02.720]   a day, and living to age 100 over your lifetime on the active investing.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.360]   Mike, what would you say to him?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.680]   I mean, I would just turn to what Jack always says.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:20.200]   The math shows that the average low-cost, passively-managed dollar will and must beat
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.240]   the average actively-managed dollar, so you're just playing your odds.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.120]   That's all there is to it.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   Sort of along the same lines.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.560]   I mean, the logic is brutal.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.000]   Before costs, investors collectively match the performance of the market averages.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.700]   After costs, investors collectively must earn less.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.960]   If you hold down your costs, you're going to lag the market by less than other investors
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.280]   who are incurring the huge expenses charged by actively-managed funds, and thus over time
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:54.040]   compounded, you're going to accumulate far more money.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   You have to add one more thing to that, which is the comeback to that is, "Yes, I'm going
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.840]   to pick only the best active managers," and you have to know the comeback for that as
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   well.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:16.560]   But, you know, 45 seconds in an elevator, I try to avoid doomed people, so I wouldn't
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.400]   even make the effort.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.840]   Well, there's also an idea, too, that people are used to thinking you have to pay more
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.640]   to get quality, and that's just simply not the case in investing, and so maybe to try
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:34.420]   to chip away at that notion that there's really no such thing as an expert who can pick investments
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.360]   better than the index.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.120]   So you're really just wasting money at that.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.720]   You don't get better quality by paying more when it comes to investing in finance.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.840]   Christine, what would you say?
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.680]   Well, maybe to offer a little bit of a contrarian view on costs.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.720]   One thing that, certainly costs matter, but we find that when we look at the lowest cost,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:05.240]   say quintile of active funds, actually you have a fighting shot at beating an index,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.560]   so it's just costs matter.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.800]   Whatever product type you choose, and certainly ETFs and TIFs have lower costs, so that's
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.720]   a nice, simple way to run a portfolio, but if you choose the subset of low-cost active
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:28.400]   funds to look at, that you probably have a fighting shot at doing reasonably well, too.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.200]   Anybody else?
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:37.080]   The next question comes from Lady Geek, and I put the question in, there she is, right
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   here.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.700]   I put the question in, and then I said, "You know, that's a silly question," and I took
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.960]   it out, and then I started thinking about it, and I figured that Lady Geek knows more
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.840]   than I do about what's going on on the forum, and what's being discussed.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.680]   The question has to do with cryptocurrency.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.880]   Does everybody know what that is, like bitcoins and blockchains, and all that kind of stuff?
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.400]   So the question is, from Lady Geek, says, "The popularity of cryptocurrency in the
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.520]   Bogle Heads Forum has exploded exponentially within the past month.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.400]   We have a number of forum members who are enthusiastically helping investors on the
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.120]   appropriate amount for their portfolio.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:20.320]   Unfortunately, new investors are assuming this activity means they should hold cryptocurrency
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.160]   in their portfolio.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.720]   To stem the tide, we've put a 5% recommendation.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.680]   Can you elaborate on the role of cryptocurrency in people's portfolios?"
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   I'll give my opinion.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.520]   It's going to be the last person holding the bag.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.880]   So what do you think?
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.120]   I just bought Bitcoin.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.760]   Let me explain.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.860]   I wrote about it for AARP, and as I was learning how to buy it and the like, I really felt
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:00.480]   like I needed to actually buy it to make sure that everything I was writing was accurate.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   And what do I think my 200—by the way, my $200 is now worth about $250.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.040]   $250 or $2,000?
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.480]   $250.00, not comma.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.000]   What do I think it'll be worth in five years?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Probably zero.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.240]   But it does solve some problems.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:30.440]   I mean, it really—there's 2.3 billion people that have smartphones but not bank accounts.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:37.280]   There's no 4% commission that the credit card company charges.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.440]   There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.800]   On the other hand, there's over 1,000 cryptocurrencies.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.480]   Who's to say I can't invent Rothcoin that does better than Bitcoin?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.760]   So I personally am not going to buy more than what I bought.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:01.400]   But it's not a completely baseless item either.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.640]   Does Morningstar follow cryptocurrency?
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.120]   No, not yet.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.280]   In fact, I was just thinking we had a thing going around the office a couple weeks ago.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:15.040]   It was some internet joke about like your own craft beer could be named after your grandfather's
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.840]   profession plus some concept that you don't understand.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.880]   And one of my colleagues said, "Candyman Bitcoin."
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.040]   We just don't feel like we have our arms around it.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.720]   It's not to say that we would never cover cryptocurrencies in some fashion, but I don't
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.240]   know that anything's on the radar in the near term.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.840]   I'm definitely not at all an expert in cryptocurrency.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.800]   General principle I follow, though, is that I'm not eager to add anything new to my portfolio
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   ever.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.560]   I'm happy to watch it and learn.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.920]   So happy to hold zero, probably will be happy to hold zero for another decade and then we'll
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   see.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:03.000]   Yeah, there's another thing here which goes unsaid, which is that people get confused
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.880]   by Bitcoin and they're not able to separate out the asset itself, which is almost certainly
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:16.280]   a bubble, from the technology, the blockchain technology, which may or may not prove to
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.200]   be extremely important and transformative.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:27.080]   But you're not going to profit from that by buying Bitcoins.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.840]   So with that, I'd like to go back to a subject that you touched on, but it wasn't a direct
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   question.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.680]   Four people asked about it, Tim Sung, Joel Goodman, SimpleSauce from the Boglehead forum,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.600]   but I'm going to read Andrew Jacob's question.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.200]   I'm going to direct it at Jonathan first.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.960]   He says, "In Bogle on Mutual Funds, Mr. Bogle explains why international investing has risk
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.240]   and perhaps investors should keep their money on U.S. stock.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.920]   It concerns me that virtually no other passive investing author agrees with Mr. Bogle.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   Can you expand more on the risks that Bogle discusses and if international stocks and
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:12.600]   bonds are even necessary?"
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:19.000]   Sorry, Jack.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.400]   So we go back to the market portfolio.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.600]   Four quadrants, U.S. stocks, U.S. bonds, foreign stocks, foreign bonds.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:36.320]   I do not hold the global market portfolio, even though as an indexer, arguably I should.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:43.560]   Because the global market portfolio reflects the wisdom of all investors worldwide.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:51.240]   They've voted with every security they bought and sold and decided that this is the fairly
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.500]   valued collection of securities that you ought to have.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:05.600]   As a U.S. investor who will retire and buy wheelchairs and early bird specials and nursing
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:14.480]   homes in U.S. dollars, I am not willing to have quite that much foreign currency exposure.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.080]   So when I build my portfolio, I focus on just three of the four.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.480]   I don't own international bonds.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   I just own international stocks, U.S. stocks, and U.S. bonds.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.000]   These days I own them in roughly equal amounts.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   If I do that, I end up with about 30 percent foreign currency exposure, which I think is
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.520]   a bit high.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:49.280]   But once I get to retirement, I intend for it to be somewhat lower.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:55.720]   So I do believe that there is currency concerns in investing too heavily in the international
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.600]   markets, which is why I don't own international bonds.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   But I also do believe that including international stocks in a portfolio not only adds important
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:14.520]   diversification, it not only gives you exposure to a part of the global financial markets,
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   which is arguably cheaper than the other three major sectors, but finally, and this is one
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.840]   thing that doesn't really keep me up at night, not very much does, but the one investment
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:35.240]   concern that sits in the back of my mind is what's going to be the next Japan.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:43.640]   If you were a Japanese investor in 1989 who had a strong home bias and you were fully
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:51.680]   invested in Japanese stocks, a quarter century later you would not be a happy camper.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:57.560]   I, on the off chance that the U.S. market turns out to be the next Japan, which I don't
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:03.440]   think it will be, I think it's a very low probability, but we talked about Pascal's
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   wager earlier today, we have to think not only about probabilities but also about consequences.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.280]   If perchance the U.S. stock market turns out to be the next Japan, I do not want to have
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.880]   too many of my eggs, I don't want to have the majority of my eggs in that particular
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   basket.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:28.480]   Yeah, the thing that I like to say is I can't predict the future, therefore I diversify
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.040]   and I live by that, and the only problem with that is that diversification works whether
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.640]   you want it to or not, and what I mean by that is in the past 10 years that foreign
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.440]   diversification hasn't worked well, but if you believe in mean reversion, that means
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.560]   that your odds are pretty good going forward, which is also based on valuations.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.000]   So Alan, what's your opinion on this?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.240]   I have half the amount of stock that's recommended by Vanguard, I have zero international bonds,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.680]   you know, half the amount of international stock.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.280]   Is that wrong?
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.880]   I do own Vanguard International Bond, but really the same thing as Bitcoin, I stuck
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.640]   my toe in the water when it first came out and I haven't bought any more of it.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.680]   But, you know, I wouldn't only buy Colorado stocks, so therefore I argue we shouldn't
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.040]   only buy U.S. stocks, we should also own some international.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.360]   I overweight the U.S., and if I had access to a low-cost index fund to buy stocks in
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.160]   companies from other planets, I would do that.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:40.920]   Jack, can you launch that please?
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.000]   One point I would make on this whole thing is, and we've looked at this at Morningstar,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.600]   is this issue of country of domicile as being the organizing principle behind what gets
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.520]   classified as a U.S. stock and what's a foreign stock, and as we all know, many of these companies,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.280]   whether U.S. or foreign, are very global.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:03.080]   So it's feeling more and more like a vestige of a bygone era to be looking at country of
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:08.280]   domicile when deciding what's a U.S. or foreign company, which I guess is a long way of saying
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:16.080]   that I think the more diversified you can be, the better, because the organizing classification
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.600]   system for foreign versus U.S. just isn't very useful.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.920]   So the next question is aimed at Bill Bernstein, since he studies this.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.280]   This is from Brent Hunsberger.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.720]   He's a financial writer.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   In fact, could I have a raise of hands, how many people are in like the financial business,
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.640]   you know, advice, manage money, write for it, and just a curiosity.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.600]   Okay, it's quite a few.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:49.680]   But Brent writes, and I know you asked Jack of this, so Bill, if you'd give your response,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.320]   a lot of discussion that a point can be reached where there's too much investing.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   Is that possible?
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:03.440]   Well, if you're an economic historian, you'll say, of course, you know, you get to something
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.600]   I think it's a very obscure term called a periwig society, where everybody is a rentier,
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   where they're just they own bonds or stocks, and they just collect income.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.040]   And Jack writes about this, and he writes about this very eloquently.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:22.320]   I don't know what the percent of S&P earnings are for financial services companies, but
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.920]   it's on the order of, what, 20, 25 percent, something like that.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.200]   Jack, Jack nods, and he says, yeah, that's about right.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   And that's too much.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   All right.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:39.440]   The job of the financial sector is to reallocate capital, and it is not healthy to have that
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.240]   part of your economy be that big.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:49.840]   I mean, think about a society in which 90 percent of corporate profits and of income
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.920]   comes from finance.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.600]   That's going to be a pretty miserable and cruel place.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.160]   So yeah, you certainly can have too much finance, and I think we have too much finance right
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   now.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:08.920]   You know, if the entire financial industry was replaced by Gus Sauter clones, you know,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:15.540]   the industry would be about 99.5 percent smaller.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.540]   Anyone else?
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.680]   The next question is aimed at Mike Piper.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.120]   This is from Abjeet Dittar.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.640]   I'm sorry I pronounced your name incorrectly.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.080]   He says, I have a 401(k) at work, and I don't know what to do.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:35.360]   Should I dump $18,000 in the first day of the year, or should I space $1,500 a month?
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:42.400]   If you have the cash flow earlier, it's better.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.000]   Well, actually, before you dump in your 18 grand, you should find out how the company
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.720]   matches your contributions, because some companies will match based on the total amount as of
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.360]   the end of the year, and others will match pay period by pay period.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.200]   So if you put in your 18 grand on January 1, you may find you miss out on the match
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.520]   for all the other subsequent pay periods.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   Super good point.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.760]   Totally wrong what I just said.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:16.680]   Could I have that in writing?
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.720]   Everybody's got an opinion, right?
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.140]   So the next one is from Victoria F. She writes on the forum quite a bit.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.720]   It has to do with fixed income.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.280]   It's going to be aimed at Alan.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.760]   Thanks for giving us an opportunity to ask a question.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   Here's my question.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.160]   What are the best current strategies for fixed income securities?
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.960]   CDs, tips, tip funds, bond funds, short-term, long-term, intermediate, and how do you feel
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.920]   about brokered CDs?
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   Yes.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.720]   My portfolio, by the way, it's roughly 45% equities, 55% fixed income, and by the way,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.160]   fixed income so far this century has beaten global stocks.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.060]   So of my fixed income, I have roughly two-thirds in CDs.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.600]   So there's two strategies.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.120]   Strategy number one are banks like Ally Bank or Sallie Mae Bank that are paying what a
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:23.720]   total bond would pay, and then they have a five-month for Ally, six-month for Sallie
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.600]   Mae early withdrawal penalty.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:32.920]   So if interest rates ever go up, it's a way of having a put, the right to sell it back.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:39.160]   And the second strategy that I use that's probably only about 25 or 30% of the CD strategy
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.480]   are brokered CDs purchased on the secondary market.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:51.200]   And the sweet spot tends to be in the neighborhood of a seven, eight-year duration, and those
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.160]   yield an extra 40, 50 bps over the market.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.880]   I was meeting with John Emmerich at Vanguard yesterday, and I said to him, you know, because
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.480]   he manages the Quant Active Strategy Group, if he could beat the market by 40, 50 bps,
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.800]   would he consider that successful, and his answer was yes.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:20.720]   Well, the CD strategy does beat the total bond by probably 50, 60 bps per year with
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.480]   a little bit less risk.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.520]   So that's my strategy on fixed income.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:32.120]   I was on a global indexing panel a few months ago in California, and I was going over that
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.120]   idea.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.200]   And my other two panelists, one was arguing for high-yield bonds, aka junk, and the other
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:46.400]   one was arguing for safe dividend stocks like Eastman Kodak and General Motors.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.120]   And I looked at the two, and I said dumb in front of the much bigger audience than this,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.560]   dumb and dumber.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.000]   I think you're right on, Jonathan, on me being controversial.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.640]   But this is a friendly group.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:09.100]   A follow-up to that, Stuart Halbert wants to know, what about my low-risk fixed income?
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:14.080]   Should it be tips, treasuries, or investment grade?
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.720]   Seriously, yes.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.720]   All of them.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   All.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   Okay.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.320]   No junk.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.200]   So this is for Bill Bernstein.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.680]   He says, for all my taxable investors in the highest tax bracket, do you have an updated
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.800]   asset allocation for taxable TED?
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.440]   He's the lucky guy to have this problem.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.240]   He's in the highest tax bracket.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.480]   What do you recommend on fixed income?
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:49.560]   For fixed income, again, I think that the taxable bracket is not really that relevant.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.000]   It's really more important that you diversify.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.880]   The lion's share should be in CDs and in treasuries.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:04.020]   If you're really high income and you have a very large amount of assets, Alan's strategy
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.800]   of doing brokered CDs in the secondary market is going to be very hard work, because those
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:12.480]   are bought in generally very small lots.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:19.440]   But if you've got the time and nothing better to do, it's a good way of earning the 50 or
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.880]   60 extra dips.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.400]   And then, you know, what part do munis play?
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:32.480]   We have a 40% limit in our practice on munis, no matter how much assets you have.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.960]   They may be a little more tax efficient, but they're also riskier as well, particularly
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.480]   in the teeth of the financial crisis.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.800]   So it's really, really, you know, your income and your tax bracket really don't impact that
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   very much.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.880]   I think the strategy is the same for everybody.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.180]   Any other comments?
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.000]   This is from Joel Goodman again.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.020]   He says, "You're all writers, and you all get feedback from the articles you write.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:06.720]   What has been the most interest of articles that you've written, and which one has generated
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:17.940]   the most disagreement with your readers?"
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:26.560]   So when I was at the Journal, and even with my own site now, you know, if I'm feeling
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:33.360]   a little down and I want some audience appreciation, you know, I'll write either about money and
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.800]   happiness or about how I've helped my kids financially, and, you know, the page views
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   just light up.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   It's like crack cocaine.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:47.400]   I feel so good by the end of the day.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:54.840]   In terms of controversial stuff, one of the pieces that I remember from recent years was
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.640]   a piece where I wrote about why you shouldn't have a budget.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.080]   And basically the argument was, as long as you're saving enough, it doesn't really matter
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.440]   how you spend the rest of your money.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.360]   I was really surprised.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:12.560]   I got a boatload of hate mail on that.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.040]   It seems that, you know, just having a budget is a sign of virtue, and if you're not doing
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:24.640]   it, you're a wayward individual and you're destined for hell.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:32.960]   I would say annuities, bank on yourself whole life type of schemes, gold.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:38.160]   That's where I get the most amount of hate mail and the occasional threat to be sued
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.120]   if we don't take it off the site or withdraw it or something like that.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.280]   And I don't do it to make people mad, and I'll admit, by the way, paying my kids college
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:54.520]   tuition or having you all come to a free dinner seminar to sell you something with all the
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.240]   upside of the market, no downside risk, I would do it, and I would probably think I'm
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:06.720]   the force for good, and you guys will be so sorry when the market goes down.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:12.480]   Back in late 2011, Vanguard changed the allocation in their life strategy funds.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:17.760]   It used to have an active management component, and they got rid of that so it was all passively
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.280]   managed and the cost went down as a result.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.640]   So I switched at that time from having a DIY allocation of index funds to putting 100 percent
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:33.320]   of our retirement savings into the life strategy growth fund, and that was probably both the
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:37.560]   most disagreed with article as well as the one that people got most excited about.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.680]   There were so many people who thought, "This is something you spend so much time on and
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.680]   you're just punting?
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.040]   You're just putting it in this one fund of funds and calling it a day?"
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.160]   And then there were other people who thought that was awesome.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:54.520]   They were looking for permission to do the same thing, and I had just given it to them,
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   basically.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:02.320]   The one that probably got the most positive review was the one where I – it was an article
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.720]   I wrote in the journal, which has already been quoted as, you know, to stop playing
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   the game.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.760]   Once you've won the game, you stop playing it.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.240]   The one that got the most vehement reaction by far wasn't one that I wrote, but that
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.160]   I was quoted in, and I was asked to comment on the portfolio of a prominent political
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.120]   person that was very heavy in precious metals equities, and I said that it was one half
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:31.680]   step from a cellar full of canned goods and 9mm rounds.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:37.640]   And for some odd reason, that got a lot of negative political comment, but I can't
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:43.280]   talk about that anymore, so.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   Christine, how about you?
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.520]   You put out a lot of information.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.160]   Oh, thank you.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:53.080]   I would say of the things that I've written that have gotten the most positive feedback,
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.240]   probably the things that I've done around the topic of elder care, helping my elderly
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:04.840]   parents through their final years and dealing with dementia, with my dad's dementia issues
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:10.960]   and the financial and the many other implications of something like that.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.520]   I think there's a lot of pent-up demand for people to share their experiences, so there
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.340]   was a lot of feedback on what I wrote, but also just people wishing to share their own
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.240]   experiences and learn from one another.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.660]   So that was and has been a great learning experience for me.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:31.320]   In terms of areas that are the most contentious, gold certainly is one.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.320]   I don't tend to write about it really at all.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.760]   Anything around Social Security and anything that gets people into that quasi-political
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:45.440]   zone would tend to set off food fights, not so much at us, but a lot of sparring among
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.180]   our users.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:55.640]   In terms of a piece that I would say generated a lot of constructive discussion, one was
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   about the role of Social Security in your asset allocation, whether Social Security
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.060]   should affect your asset allocation in any way.
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:08.360]   There was a lot of great discussion there with people favoring different approaches
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.880]   to that particular issue.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:16.440]   How about an article that created hate mail?
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.600]   Nothing jumps to mind really.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.360]   I can't think of a good example.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.440]   I certainly do receive my share of feedback, both negative and positive, but I can't think
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:30.520]   of any one topic that generated a lot of negativity.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.920]   It's hard to hate Christine, it really is.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:37.560]   I'm a much easier target.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   Wade, how about you?
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.420]   You've done some controversial retirement withdrawal things.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.960]   Yeah, so the most popular article I wrote was a really dry piece just reviewing statistics
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:55.640]   on how long people live past 65, so I have no idea what drives reader interest.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.800]   It's really hard to predict in advance what's going to get more page views versus something
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   else.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.040]   But yeah, with controversial topics, a lot of it relates to the investments world still
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.880]   hasn't caught up with how retirement changes and when you take distributions, how that
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.120]   amplifies the impact of market volatility.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:17.760]   So much of it is based on assuming an 8% rate of return every year or something like that.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.800]   And it doesn't link the assets to the liabilities, the fact that you have to match those assets
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   to liabilities.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.320]   So when I try to explain how simple risk pooling with a simple income annuity is a cheaper,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:34.240]   more efficient way to meet retirement expenses, that can generate a lot of controversy.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.920]   Anything I do with regard to the 4% rule, and I really just got started with that because
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:43.260]   I looked at the international data and the 4% rule only worked in the U.S. and Canada
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:47.520]   and there were 18 other countries where it didn't work, so that got me started on that
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   kick.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:54.720]   But people really want to have faith in the 4% rule and so I get some negative comments
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.940]   in that regard.
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.360]   What about increasing your asset allocation as you age past retirement?
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:06.620]   Yeah, so the rising equity glide path I never meant to really be advice for people to use
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.620]   in their portfolios.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:12.480]   It was more just the point that with lifetime sequence of returns risk, you want the lowest
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.880]   stock allocation when you're the most vulnerable to losses and that's at the retirement date.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.980]   And as a natural consequence of spending conservatively, a lot of people may just see their stock allocation
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.360]   increases in retirement.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.600]   It works as a risk management strategy because worst case scenarios for retirees are bad
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.540]   market returns early in retirement, good market returns later, and that's exactly what the
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.380]   strategy would protect.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.300]   But I understand there's a lot of behavioral concerns about trying to implement it and
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:47.880]   so when people point that out to me, I can accept their criticism in that regard.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.660]   What do you recommend as an allocation?
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.940]   Somebody right at retirement and how high do you take it back up after retirement?
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.400]   Well that really just depends on a case-by-case basis about their risk tolerance and risk
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   capacity.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.740]   But the examples we were looking at were things like rather than keeping 60% stocks throughout
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:10.060]   the whole retirement period, start it at 30% and increase it back up to 60%.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:18.380]   So something in that ballpark I think would be an appropriate way to represent that strategy.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.380]   Anyone else?
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:27.860]   Yeah, I just would amplify on that a little bit, which is I tend to separate people out
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.340]   into sort of a spectrum, so all the way at the right side of the spectrum is the person
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.860]   who's only got five or ten years of residual living expenses saved up.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:42.300]   In other words, they can fund the retirement with fixed income assets for five or ten years
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:48.380]   and those people are in very deep yogurt and should probably pretty much annuitize everything
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:54.620]   they have after they spend down to get that Social Security at 70.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:02:01.740]   And someone who's got 30 or 40 times their residual income, which is probably going to
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:09.820]   be a lot of people in this audience, can probably own a very big chunk of equity because that
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.300]   money really isn't theirs.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.860]   It's going to go to their heirs.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.540]   And then finally, you've got the person all the way to the other side of that spectrum
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:24.900]   who has some ridiculous amount of assets, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 times their annual living
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.900]   expenses.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.820]   And that person is in the Warren Buffett situation.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.260]   They can put almost 100 percent of their assets into fixed income because just the dividend
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.540]   yield alone, even in the worst case scenario, is going to see them through, if they're that
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.540]   risk tolerant.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:43.180]   The number of people who have both that risk tolerance and that amount of assets is vanishingly
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180]   small though.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:51.440]   I meant stocks, I'm sorry, yeah, that's what I meant to say, yeah, sorry.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.100]   Anyone else?
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.940]   The last question, there's going to be two more questions and then we're going to have
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:03.100]   the panel just pass on words of wisdom that they learned over the years.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.900]   I mean, after all, we look at our portfolio, they live with their portfolio, they do it
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900]   all day.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:12.420]   But the next to last question is about long-term care insurance.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:16.500]   I remember five years ago, we asked the question to Bill Schulzeis.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.140]   His answer was, "I don't know, what do you think?"
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.980]   And that was his answer and he wouldn't go any farther than that.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.860]   So what I'm going to do is bring it up again.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.740]   What do you think about long-term care insurance?
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.900]   When should you buy it?
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.820]   How much should you buy?
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:36.620]   What's your opinions on that?
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620]   It's tough.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.900]   If you don't have a lot in assets, you shouldn't buy it.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.620]   If you have a lot of assets, you should self-insure.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.820]   It is pure insurance and I believe in insurance.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:53.740]   The problem is you can't buy a policy outside of a hybrid, which has other problems where
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.180]   the rates are fixed.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:03.380]   And so many people are coming to me after paying for 10 years, getting a 50, 100% increase.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.780]   And they don't know what to do because now they're 10 years closer to needing it.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.540]   So it's a very tough call.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:18.020]   And we tend to think of how much we're going to pay when we're in long-term care.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:23.300]   But we fail to think about we're no longer going to need a house, a car, insurance, eating
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.820]   out, traveling, et cetera.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.060]   So you have to take that into account.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.580]   And then long-term care covers a nursing home.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:35.980]   There are things that we're going to need in between probably that aren't covered.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.260]   So it's a very tough call.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.420]   I don't have it.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:46.180]   There are four options to fund long-term care, self-funding, Medicaid, which is by far the
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.100]   biggest provider of funding, the traditional long-term care insurance, and then the hybrid
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:56.180]   policies that connect long-term care with either life insurance or an annuity.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:01.900]   And one area to emphasize, I know a lot of people plan strategies to protect assets to
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.500]   be able to qualify for Medicaid.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.180]   And I think that may be a mistake with demographics.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:12.300]   If you can afford to pay for your long-term care, you probably are going to feel pretty
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:17.860]   bad if you're in a situation where you're in a Medicaid-funded long-term care facility.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:23.060]   So I would caution people against specifically trying to plan strategies so that Medicaid
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.020]   would pay for their long-term care.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:29.180]   The traditional long-term care insurance has had a lot of problems.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:33.860]   Policies today should be in better shape because part of the problem was just interest rates
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.700]   coming down so much and staying at low sustained levels.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:42.580]   The insurance companies hadn't planned for that, as well as just the lapse rates were
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.060]   not as high as insurance companies were expecting.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:51.260]   So today's policies should be priced better in terms of not seeing as many premium increases.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:55.220]   And just as you can't wait too long to get long-term care insurance because at some point
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.940]   you may no longer qualify.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.420]   The rule of thumb, sweet spot, tends to be around age 50 to start thinking about that.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   But certainly younger or older could still be appropriate.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.020]   John, what's your opinion on it?
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:17.020]   I really hate the long-term care question because I just don't think there is a good
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.020]   solution.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.580]   The good solution is to be a bogal head, save a lot of money, index, and make sure that
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.740]   you have more than enough assets so that you don't have to buy long-term care insurance.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.740]   That is the good answer.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:32.300]   For people who are in that difficult spot between maybe $300,000 and a million dollars
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:39.020]   in assets who need to consider long-term care insurance, you know, I would hold your nose
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.580]   and buy either traditional or hybrid policy.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:48.660]   But I find it really tough to recommend policies because, you know, this is an area where once
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.900]   again the insurance industry has not covered itself with glory.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:57.380]   I've had so many emails from people over the years, bought long-term care, you know, held
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.940]   it for years, and then the insurance companies come along and asked for a premium increase
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.340]   that they simply cannot afford.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.500]   And you know, I don't want to be responsible for people ending up in that bind.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.580]   I wish that we could get to a point where there was a long-term care insurance product
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.180]   that people could buy that I could happily recommend.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:21.100]   Yeah, I do this annual compendium of long-term care statistics, and one number really jumped
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.700]   out at me, and I don't have the specific, but it was something like 10 years ago there
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.720]   were 50 companies selling long-term care insurance.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.660]   Now I think there are like eight.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:36.820]   So there are simply companies getting out of that business altogether, many companies,
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.740]   and since when is that sort of environment ever good for consumers?
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:46.100]   So the hybrid products, Alan, you mentioned them, and they seem to be coming on strong
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.940]   and replacing the straight long-term care policies.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.380]   I'm curious, have you done any work on those?
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.780]   Because I haven't examined them in detail, but it seems like they're kind of tricky to
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.260]   cost compare and not as transparent as they could be.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:06.940]   I have, and a hybrid comes with a whole life component, and it's just extra.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:07.940]   Or an annuity, right?
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.820]   I mean, those are the two types.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:16.020]   So they're just extra fees in there, and then as I tell my clients, what they're really
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.940]   doing when they're buying long-term care is protecting money from the errors against the
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:28.660]   fact that they may spend, statistically very unlikely, especially for men, to spend 10,
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.460]   12 years in a home.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.260]   So what they're really doing is protecting their kids, protecting their heirs, and that's
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.740]   not the main purpose of the portfolio.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:41.860]   And I also point out that, statistically speaking, since the insurance companies and the agents
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.340]   expect to make money, they're likely to leave more money to their heirs if they don't have
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.980]   it.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:53.060]   Yeah, let me just go around and ask the other panel members.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.340]   Alan, I think, threw out a figure that implicitly said at a million dollars of assets, you don't
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.220]   need long-term care insurance, or maybe Mike did, I forget which of you did.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.540]   It was you.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.540]   Okay.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.420]   Well, the bottom line is that, do other people agree with that?
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:13.620]   Do the other panel members think that a million is sufficient to avoid long-term care insurance?
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   I don't.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.660]   I think that you would need more, and I always share my personal experience on this front,
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:23.700]   which is that my dad needed long-term care, which we had provided in the home for several
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.100]   years and then eventually determined that it was going to be a better setting, safer
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.760]   setting for him to be out of the house in a long-term care facility.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.840]   But at that point, my mom had developed a care need.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:41.260]   So we had two, my parents had been advised to self-fund long-term care, and they were
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:47.740]   fine in the end, but we had two long-term care funding needs going on at the same time,
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.660]   and that can happen legitimately with married couples where they need care delivered in
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.340]   two different settings.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:58.260]   So that's another thing to keep in mind, that I think those thresholds or the rules of thumb
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:04.260]   for when you'd want to self-fund long-term care, I think that people should set the bar
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.980]   a little higher than maybe what had been used in the past.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:10.980]   Can you give me a number?
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:17.420]   I can't, Bill, really, but I would be nervous about setting one million as an appropriate
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.940]   threshold to think about self-funding.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:26.460]   Yeah, that's what I was going to touch on, that's implicit in what Christine is saying,
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:31.180]   is the threshold definitely has to be higher for a married couple.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.340]   And Wade was talking about this a little bit earlier, is that Medicaid will step in at
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:44.700]   some point, and for an unmarried person, that's not so, it's a better situation being Medicaid-provided
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:49.620]   care rather than a married couple, because for one of two people in a married couple
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.540]   to qualify for Medicaid, the couple has to spend down their assets.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.500]   And there's some protections for the other spouse, but they're limited.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:03.700]   So if spouse A needs long-term care and has to spend down their assets to qualify for
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:08.700]   Medicaid, spouse B can be in a bad situation.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:13.060]   Right, and just one other comment about couples.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.180]   Because women tend to live longer, they tend to, you have some risk-sharing within the
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:21.580]   household, but it's often the wife takes care of the husband, the husband dies, then the
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:26.380]   wife needs long-term care after that, so she's really in a more vulnerable position.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.820]   And so when you're thinking about any sort of long-term care protection to have that
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.380]   in mind as well.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.140]   And the wife is likely to live longer in long-term care.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:42.460]   So there's an argument that if you're going to buy it, especially if the two spouses are
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:47.940]   the same age or the wife is younger, to buy more for the wife.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.900]   And you could easily go through a million dollars, number one, you can spend that down
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:57.540]   to $300,000 before you go into the home, and therefore you might not have enough.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:05.180]   So it's hard to say, and it also depends on how nice you want the nursing home to be.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:10.860]   Okay, the last question has two parts to it.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:15.460]   One is, how do you encourage young people to take an interest in becoming financially
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.460]   secure?
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:21.500]   It's more of a motivational question, since you're writers, you're always motivating people.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.420]   The second one, since this is an advanced group, most of us have made it, we've become
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:31.060]   financially independent, how do you give assets to a younger generation without decreasing
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.860]   their ambition?
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:43.220]   Well, Warren Buffett put it very nicely, he said he wanted all of his descendants to have
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:49.460]   enough money to do anything they wanted to do, but not enough money to do nothing.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.540]   And that's good advice, basically what he's saying is you pay for education.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:13:01.100]   A good way to give money to children is you can endow them, you can give them a fair amount
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:07.420]   of assets and have them have substantial portfolios, but they have to know that you're watching,
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:13.980]   and they have to know there's more money behind that coming from you when you pass away, and
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:22.020]   you're going to watch and see how well they steward the first aliquot.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.300]   When they're eight years old, do you have them help you write a book called How a Second
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.980]   Grader Beat Wall Street?
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:36.900]   You know, it is really hard to convince people that they need to save, and probably one of
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:42.140]   the biggest ahas in my practice, which should have been obvious, is people that came to
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.520]   me saying, "Can I retire?"
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.420]   Those that thought, "Oh my gosh, I'm pretty sure I can," in two years, had maybe a $50,000
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.420]   net worth.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:57.980]   Those that said, "I'll never be able to retire," in some cases had tens of millions of dollars.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.620]   And it's the fact that those that weren't concerned about retirement never learned to
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.740]   defer spending, and you can invest like Warren Buffet if you're not saving anything, you're
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.140]   not going to get to retirement.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:18.300]   So I don't have a particularly good answer to how you get somebody to change behavior.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:23.060]   You know, the client that comes to me that hasn't saved anything needs a psychiatrist
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:29.180]   or psychologist, not me.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.940]   I've written one of my monthly newsletters this year, which is devoted to this whole
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:41.060]   topic of ambition, partly because I see what's going on with my kids, and I see what's going
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:45.020]   on with a number of their friends.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:53.860]   They all grow up in comfortable, upper-middle-class households, and almost universally, they
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.860]   are not driven to make money.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:04.220]   And I look at that, and I think, "Okay, maybe that is the privilege that comes with an affluent
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:13.580]   society that we raise kids for which making money is not their uppermost concern."
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:20.100]   I've sort of made my peace with that, but what I worry about is kids who have no ambition.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:25.020]   So even if you're not driven to make dollars, at least you should be driven to make the
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.540]   world a better place.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:33.020]   And fortunately, my kids, even as they are not driven to make money, do seem to be driven
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.380]   to make the world a better place.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.620]   My daughter works for an education non-profit, my son is getting a PhD in Middle East history
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:46.060]   at Yale, neither of them will be rich.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:52.220]   I worry more about their friends who graduate from college, I hear this again and again,
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:16:02.460]   and they graduate from top universities, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and then they just drift.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:09.900]   Two years traveling the world, only to return to become a barista.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:15.660]   And that really concerns me, not because they're not doing anything with their lives.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:21.340]   What concerns me is, and I hope you all feel the same way, that there is great pleasure
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:26.860]   to be had in working hard at something that you think is important and you find challenging
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.060]   and you're passionate about, and they're missing out.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:38.300]   And that really bothers me, and I'm not sure how to inculcate that ambition other than
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:45.100]   to talk constantly at home about how wonderful it is to work hard at something that you think
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.100]   is important.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:52.700]   They don't have to go out there and want to make multi-million dollars, but you want them
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:17:00.840]   to go out there and want to change the world.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.780]   So there was a two-part question.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:08.700]   As far as getting young people interested in investing, I guess it depends how young
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.140]   we're talking about.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:15.340]   If they're just out of college and they still don't quite get it, I don't really know what
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.340]   to say.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.780]   But I've told this story a number of times.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.100]   It's what my mom did with me when I was eight or nine, maybe.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.900]   She gave me, or maybe suggested I bought it with some savings, I don't honestly remember.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:39.620]   But it was a share of Procter & Gamble stock, and we went to the grocery store, and we looked
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.280]   at all the different Procter & Gamble products there.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   And there's a million.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   I mean, a ton of things that you see in your house or in your friends' houses, and kind
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.780]   of explained that any time somebody buys one of these things, now as a shareholder, you're
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.380]   going to earn a little money.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.820]   And it was so tangible, so concrete.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.820]   And it was a big thing for me.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:11.520]   And I'm tearing up talking about it.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]   So it was a big deal.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.420]   I thought it was the neatest thing in the world.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:19.540]   And we didn't talk about mutual funds or the fact that the share price goes up and down.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.460]   It was just, you own this business, a small, small piece of it.
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:28.460]   And when people buy the products, you can make some money.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.460]   And that's powerful.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:33.060]   And I thought that was so cool.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:39.320]   Yeah, just one or two more things on the spending side.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.700]   Your kids learn from example.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:46.660]   I mean, if you're driving a 20-year-old Honda and are living in a small house, you've done
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   your kids a service.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:52.940]   If you're driving a Beamer and living in a McMansion, you probably doomed them.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.180]   And I had thought I had done everything that I could possibly do to make my kids frugal.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:02.300]   And I thought I pretty well succeeded until I read a column that Jonathan wrote, which
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.800]   he gave me two extra little wrinkles that I hadn't thought of and I kicked myself for
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.220]   not thinking of, which is, number one, you give them their allowance through an ATM card
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.740]   so that they're not asking you for money.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   And when the money's gone from the ATM account, the bank account, it's gone.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.560]   They have to wait until next time.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.780]   And the other one, which was even more brilliant, was to give them a dollar every time they
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:27.140]   could do with water at a restaurant instead of buying the soda.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:31.020]   Okay, we are at the end of it.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:36.180]   We appreciate you giving your time and all your words of wisdom and all your investment
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   knowledge.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:42.580]   You've each got one minute to give us a gem, just something that you've learned over the
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.860]   years that you think is really valuable that you'd like to pass on.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.340]   If we could just go down the panel, Christine, could you start it?
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.340]   Sure.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:56.620]   I guess the point I would make or one piece of wisdom is even though a lot of folks here,
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:03.380]   in fact, most of you here may be do-it-yourself type investors, get some help as you get older.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.260]   Get some sort of an investment buddy, whether it's a trusted adult child who you think is
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:13.180]   reasonably financially savvy or whether you take the step of hiring some sort of a fee-only
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.380]   financial advisor.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:20.180]   Just get some help to keep your plan on track in case, for whatever reason, you're unable
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.340]   to do it yourself.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:26.340]   I think that's my one piece of advice.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.340]   That's great advice.
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:31.940]   I think really most of the wisdom I've received about investing came from the Bogleheads community,
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:34.300]   so I don't really have much to tell this group.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:40.060]   I could probably talk longer to other groups, but keep it simple, low-cost, and focus on
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.060]   the long-term.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:50.100]   The one thing that I missed, that I realized way, way too late, is that the risk of owning
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:57.060]   stocks depends upon how old you are, so that if you're very young and you're constantly
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:01.180]   adding money and you're constantly saving, stocks are not risky at all because at some
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:05.060]   point you're going to wind up buying very low and you'll wind up doing very well.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:11.620]   On the other hand, for the reasons that Wade explained, if you are someone who is in the
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:17.580]   distribution phase, then stocks are three-mile island toxic, dangerous as all heck.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:24.180]   I wished that I had understood that at a much earlier age.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:29.020]   I'm sure that you all imagine that we who write, write for you.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.680]   That actually is completely fallacious.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.180]   We solely write for ourselves, and every time I write on a topic it's because I'm thinking
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.380]   about it in my own life.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:45.740]   One of my hobby horses in recent years has been this notion that the distinction between
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.860]   working and retirement ought to disappear.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:52.860]   It's a horrible separation.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:58.420]   What we should start to think about is how we can have lives where, as I was mentioning
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:03.780]   earlier, we can engage in activities that we think are important, we find challenging,
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:09.660]   we feel we're good at, that we're passionate about, and how we can do that throughout our
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.580]   lives, and that doesn't change when we retire.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:17.260]   The only difference is we don't have to worry about whether that work comes with a paycheck.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:23.780]   As you approach retirement, don't think about how you're going to play golf, or sit on a
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.860]   beach, or travel.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.480]   All those are fine things to do.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.160]   Think about what you're going to do with those years that's going to give you a sense of
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.460]   purpose, that's going to get you out of bed in the morning, and that you are going to
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:42.220]   be passionate about, and will make your days feel fulfilling.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:48.300]   I would say beyond the low cost diversification, keep it simple, stupid.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:55.340]   Whenever I violate that policy in life, I tend to regret it, and that includes investing.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:23:00.120]   Resist those instincts of what I think is going to happen based on whatever the political
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:08.100]   environment is, whatever country is going on, etc., and then three, make sure you're
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.180]   not having any fun with investing.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:16.180]   If you're starting to enjoy it, you're probably doing something wrong.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:21.540]   Not only should it not be, it should actually be painful.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:27.780]   I would love to tell you that I confidently bought stocks in 2008 to rebalance, but boy,
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:34.460]   it hurt like heck.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:39.980]   Don't assume that what people who you think are experts are going to be wrong sometimes.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:45.020]   Just a minute ago, a question was directed directly to me about 401k contributions, and
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:52.940]   I got it 100% wrong, and Jonathan jumped in, fortunately, and covered for me, but that'll
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:53.940]   happen.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:54.940]   It happens in articles and major publications.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:00.580]   You'll see things about taxes or social security that just aren't right, so before you make
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:05.020]   any irreversible decisions, double-check things.
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:09.700]   Check with more than one source, and similarly, to flip it around, sometimes you'll be the
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:13.900]   one making the mistakes, so double-check your own conclusions.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:20.060]   If you decide something, there's a good chance that there's some information you haven't
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060]   considered.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.420]   Again, before making any big decisions that you can't switch, double-check, both double-check
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.820]   your own reasoning and double-check whatever sources you're relying on.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:41.780]   Let's have a hand for the panel, and we'll start back up at 1 o'clock, 1 o'clock in here.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   Thank you.
