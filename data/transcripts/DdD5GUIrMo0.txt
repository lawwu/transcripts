[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   - We have a big week ahead on Christmas related themes
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.200]   on the podcast, but we start the week
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.440]   talking about fundraising, something that happens a lot
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.400]   this time of year, and a couple, Luke and Katie,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.960]   write in to ask you this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.300]   "I know you are familiar with men such as Hudson Taylor
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.920]   "and George Mueller.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.300]   "Should we ask our brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.440]   "to help fund the work we feel God has called us to,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.500]   "or should we simply believe that he will fund
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.200]   "the work as we seek him in prayer
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.580]   "without making our needs known to men?"
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.700]   What would you say to Luke and Katie?
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.460]   - Two clarifications about Mueller,
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.800]   George Mueller and Hudson Taylor.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.300]   Both of them, and they knew each other,
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.360]   had resolved that they would never ask anyone for money.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.440]   That's true.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.360]   But they most emphatically did make their needs known
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.700]   in general.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.540]   Both of them published monthly records
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.620]   of what had come in to the mission
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.800]   and what it had been spent on,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.540]   and where they were in the big picture financially.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.860]   So it's misleading to give the impression
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.740]   that the donors to the orphanages
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.020]   and to China Inland Mission were kept in the dark
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.180]   about the overall needs.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.980]   It is true, and I don't wanna sell these men short,
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.280]   they were incredible.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.240]   It is true that from day to day,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120]   there were specific needs that were not made known
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.760]   except to God in prayer.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.520]   This is where the miracles became most evident.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.480]   But it would not be accurate to say
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   that there were no regular communications to the donors
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.000]   about the general financial situation
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   or what had been given.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.720]   That's the first clarification.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.520]   Here's the second one.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.040]   Neither George Mueller nor Hudson Taylor
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.800]   prescribed this approach of theirs
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.680]   as the only biblical way, neither of them.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.660]   George Mueller was especially explicit about this.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.660]   He said that his main motive in starting the orphanages
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.880]   and running them this way
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.600]   was so that the Christian church in his day
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.800]   would have some fresh evidence that God answers prayer.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.000]   It was, he felt, a very special calling,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.540]   a calling on him that was appointed for him
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.180]   and not necessarily for everybody else
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920]   to glorify God in this extraordinary dependence day to day
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.680]   without telling everybody that the breakfast
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.760]   for tomorrow morning in the orphanage wasn't on hand.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.160]   So we saw remarkable things.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.200]   Now with those two clarifications,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.160]   my answer is that neither Mueller nor Taylor
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.200]   would say it is sinful for a Christian missionary
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.260]   to write a letter to possible supporters
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.040]   to explain the mission, to give vision,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480]   and to invite people to join them in financial support.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.160]   In fact, I would go beyond saying
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.720]   that it's permitted in the Bible.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.500]   I would say it is modeled in the Bible
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.680]   as the normal way of doing missions.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.800]   And I would base that mainly
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   on 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.460]   I think every Christian who hopes to receive gifts of money
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   or support some ministry
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   becomes a master of these two chapters.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.160]   So let me just show you what I mean
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.900]   by walking quickly through.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.360]   Paul explicitly urges the Corinthians.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.280]   So you could say 2 Corinthians in chapters 8 and 9
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.040]   are a ministry support letter
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.800]   because he is trying to raise money
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.120]   for the offering that he with others are gathering
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.840]   to take to the poor saints in Jerusalem.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.520]   You can read about that elsewhere in Paul's letters.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.040]   So he says in verses 6 and 7 of chapter 8,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400]   "As you excel in everything, in faith, in speech,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.920]   in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love,
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   see that you excel in this act of grace also."
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.880]   Now that's a virtual command.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.200]   Get on board with the giving.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.880]   Or verses 8 and 9, he softens it, but doesn't remove it.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.800]   He says, "I say this not as a command,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.000]   but to prove by the earnestness of others,"
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.120]   namely the people up in Macedonia
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.260]   that I've just told you about,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.260]   "by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.080]   For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.640]   that though he was rich, yet for your sakes,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.280]   he became poor, so that you by his poverty
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   might become rich."
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   And the implication is so clearly,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.800]   since they have done so well, Jesus did so well,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.020]   you're gonna do so well in the giving
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.280]   when I arrive.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.560]   Or verse 12, he encourages them
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.240]   that the willingness is what counts.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.320]   And yet, here's what he says, verse 12,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.840]   "For if the readiness is there,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.440]   it is acceptable according to what a person has,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   not according to what a person doesn't have."
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.360]   In other words, he's saying,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.960]   "Look, I'm not expecting any particular amount from anybody.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.480]   I know you're in different places financially.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.100]   What matters is your heart.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.760]   So if you have a little, give a little.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.240]   If you have a lot, give a lot,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.880]   'cause it's your heart that matters."
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.400]   Or verse 19 and 20,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.300]   he puts his own financial integrity on the line.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.300]   He says, "This grace is being ministered by us
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.420]   for the glory of the Lord himself
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.560]   and to show our goodwill.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.740]   We take this course so that no one should blame us
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.020]   about the generous gift that is being administered by us."
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.480]   In other words, you can give to us
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.280]   because we got all the safeguards in place
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   for the integrity of those who are handling this money.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.440]   Or chapter eight, verse 24,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.480]   he returns to an explicit exhortation.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.280]   "So give proof before the churches of your love
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.640]   and of our boasting about you."
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.000]   And then in chapter nine, it's just so amazing to me.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.100]   He goes so far as to say that the reason
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.440]   he's sending someone ahead with this letter
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.760]   is so that their giving would not humiliate him
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   when he gets there.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.920]   He says, "I'm sending the brothers
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.880]   so that our boasting about you
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.860]   may not prove empty in this matter
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.240]   so that you may be ready as I said you would be.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.360]   Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.160]   and find that you are not ready,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.840]   we'd be humiliated to say nothing of you
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.160]   for being so confident."
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.660]   I mean, that's incredible,
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.880]   the way he's motivating them to give.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.480]   Look, he says, "Look, I've boasted about you guys.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.080]   I've told them you're generous.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.360]   If you're not generous, I'm gonna look like an idiot.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.680]   And you're gonna be shamed and I'm gonna be shamed
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.480]   because you are generous in Christ.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.180]   Become what you are now."
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.720]   Or he goes on and gives arguments
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   that we should have great generosity
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.820]   in the freedom of giving.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.720]   And that's a real familiar passage.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.100]   God, each one must give as he has decided in his heart,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.920]   not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.640]   for God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.560]   And so maybe just one more, verse 12 of chapter nine,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   "For the ministry of this service
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.480]   is not only supplying the needs of the saints,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.200]   but is overflowing in many thanksgivings."
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   In other words, get on board with this
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.880]   because you're gonna meet the needs of saints
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.900]   and God's gonna get a lot of thanksgiving.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.640]   So, unless Luke and Katie feel
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.860]   an unusual calling from the Lord
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.660]   to demonstrate his extraordinary need-meeting power
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.500]   along the lines of Mueller and Taylor,
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.400]   the clear biblical pattern
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.660]   for the support of Christian ministry
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.740]   is to enlist Christian churches like the Corinthians
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.200]   to be part of it.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.400]   And how to go about it, I think, is laid out
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.060]   about as clearly as it could be
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.200]   in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.560]   Really, the issue comes down to
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   where are Katie and Luke going to put their trust?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.900]   Will they put it in glossy brochures and fancy websites
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.540]   and cleverly written letters?
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.780]   Or will they have a brochure and have a website
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.620]   and send their letters and put their trust
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.420]   in their heavenly Father who promises to meet every need
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.340]   as they seek the kingdom first?
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.460]   Yeah, that is so good.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.740]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.460]   And thank you for the question, Katie and Luke.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.660]   You can send your questions into us via email
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.020]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.500]   Or you can go to our online home
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.920]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   Well, the Christmas season is fully engaged,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.180]   and tomorrow we are joined by a historian
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.300]   to talk about one of the most controversial figures
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.740]   of the Christmas story.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.140]   It's Herod the Great.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.760]   I will ask this historian of the story
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.440]   of the slaughter of the innocents,
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.880]   the killing of all boys two years old and younger
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.580]   in the region of Bethlehem.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.220]   If that is historically true or if it's a fiction,
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.300]   and if it really happened,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.060]   why are there no other historical records of the event
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.020]   outside of the Bible?
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.020]   It's an interesting question,
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.220]   a rather big historical question,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.220]   and it's on the docket for tomorrow.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.660]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:02.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
