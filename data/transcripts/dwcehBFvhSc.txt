[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - We are back one last time with Dr. Albert Moeller,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.800]   the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.120]   in Louisville and author of the book,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.040]   "The Conviction to Lead, 25 Principles
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.800]   for Leadership that Matters."
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.960]   Dr. Moeller, you have a prolific output
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.960]   when it comes to content in print, digital, broadcast,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.880]   social media, video, audio, the whole spectrum.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.020]   In your book, you read this, quote,
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.400]   "Although I write books and articles,
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.420]   speak all over the country and appear in the media,
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.620]   nothing comes close to the reach of my blog," end quote.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.300]   What has most surprised you about the leadership potential
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.580]   of the digital age?
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.660]   - You know, Tony, this is something that didn't exist
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180]   when I assumed my current post of leadership
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.340]   and I'm about to complete 20 years.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.660]   When I came into this office as president
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.540]   of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540]   and all its related institutions,
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.100]   there was no worldwide web that business thought of
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.380]   on an hourly, moment by moment, instantaneous basis.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.220]   We had a web address very quickly, but it didn't matter.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.720]   And then along came different facets of the digital world,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.700]   including blogging.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.360]   I was one of the very first to start
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.940]   because it struck me that this is the instant way,
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.180]   the almost universal way that you can reach people
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.840]   without buffers, without barriers,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.540]   without needing a massive platform
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.860]   that is under the stewardship of someone else.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.060]   As you know, I was a newspaper editor.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.160]   I spent a lot of time in the media world.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.580]   I do a lot of work in television,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.300]   but someone else owns all those channels.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.260]   I had for about a decade
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.780]   a nationally broadcast daily radio program.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.660]   I enjoyed doing that immensely,
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.460]   but that was someone else's platform.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.940]   The blog enables you to have your own platform.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.520]   And it's amazing that the quick response
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.260]   you're able to do in a blog is often, I think, the secret.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.080]   And one of the things I hear on a daily basis
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.740]   is someone saying, "Look, I went to your website
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.340]   because I had a good hunch
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.900]   you'd be talking about this today.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.180]   Something happened yesterday.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.460]   Something happened this morning.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.720]   We wanna know how to think about this."
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.060]   And that's an incredible stewardship,
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.020]   but it is something that is new.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.340]   And for the sake of Christchurch,
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.260]   it is an incredible opportunity.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.620]   Because just remember, almost all those platforms
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.660]   we've been talking about
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.920]   that we were previously dependent upon
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.980]   are in someone else's hands.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.300]   And the fact is there's a huge democratization of this
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   with the digital world, and there's just a huge opening.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.780]   And one other thing from a Christian perspective,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.380]   you know, we get to leap over barriers
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.540]   that those other platforms don't leap over.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.280]   There's a great wall of China,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.740]   and there's even a great firewall of China.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.620]   But I hear constantly from people behind that firewall
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.340]   that they're reading my stuff.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.300]   And, you know, that's an incredible stewardship.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.620]   - It sure is an incredible stewardship
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.680]   and a great leadership opportunity.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.820]   One of the major themes in your book
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.800]   is that leadership is bound up and tied up with words.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.680]   Leaders cannot lead without words,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.540]   and therefore leaders must be skilled with them.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.900]   Expand on this point.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.100]   - What I say in the book that I think is really important,
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.780]   and that is where you find a leader,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.820]   you're gonna find a reader, a speaker, and a writer.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.660]   Because words are the most important tools of our craft
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.300]   and the most important means
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.980]   of conveying leadership by conviction.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620]   And so leaders need to lean into words.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100]   And obviously those words have to be the right words.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.060]   They have to be well-seasoned words,
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.860]   and they have to be words of authenticity,
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.920]   and they have to be words that lead to action.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.720]   But just try doing that without words.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.520]   And so one of the things I think we face
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.240]   is that we are in a linguistically impoverished age,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.360]   an age in which many young people are barely literate.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.640]   That doesn't mean I'm insulting their intelligence.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.960]   They're incredibly intelligent.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.800]   They're incredibly digitally adept.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.680]   But when it comes to the tasks of reading and writing
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.580]   and speaking, they've got a lot to learn.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.300]   And leadership, wherever it's found,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.080]   even now in the digital age,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.160]   whether it's, you know, Steve Jobs getting up
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.020]   and personally introducing a new product
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.260]   as he did for Apple,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100]   or it's, you know, the political candidate
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.460]   on the campaign trail,
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.240]   or it's the principal of the school, the headmaster,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.780]   gathering everyone together and saying,
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360]   this is what it's all about,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   or the pastor preaching.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.960]   It's still about words.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.420]   - Yeah, it sure is.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.640]   Part of the reason why I wrote my book, "Lit,"
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   a little book on reading,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.340]   was because I was surprised by the number of young men
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.000]   who approached me who seemed completely unskilled
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.220]   at book reading,
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.100]   many of them who had no examples of dads who had read.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.300]   You were gracious to endorse "Lit," thank you.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.740]   How do we get young men to read?
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.060]   - Oh, it's a great book.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.420]   I think it was particularly good coming from you
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.980]   because, you know, you were able to get at some things
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.100]   given your own experience.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.820]   I thought we're just fantastic.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.820]   Here's the thing.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.520]   I think we need to get men reading
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.660]   in order that they can learn how to not only to read,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.580]   but how to use the skills that you learn
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.220]   as a part of that discipline
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.300]   and be able to apply them in other arenas of life.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.940]   And it has to be a seductive process.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.460]   And, you know, I get to see that every single day.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.500]   I get to see people who probably never read a book through
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.460]   who are now avid readers.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.860]   And it's because reading, as you well know,
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.480]   as you have so well described in your own book,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.740]   is something that becomes more powerful in one's life
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.460]   once you begin to understand how it changes your thinking,
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.100]   how it feeds your soul, how it hones your mind,
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.980]   and how it gives you the ability to turn around
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.940]   and to convey to others what you wouldn't have had the tools
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.300]   to accomplish that by if you weren't a reader.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.780]   - That was Dr. Albert Moeller from his office
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.940]   at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.920]   in Louisville, Kentucky, where he serves as president.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.900]   Dr. Moeller is the author of the book,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.160]   "The Conviction to Lead,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.020]   "25 Principles for Leadership that Matters."
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.460]   And this little series of episodes
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.640]   over the past three days was taken
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.740]   from my 2012 interview with him.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.140]   Tomorrow, John Piper returns to tackle
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.740]   a really important question from a podcast listener.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.260]   Why will God not show his eternal love
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.620]   by tolerating even those who will not believe in him?
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.820]   Hmm.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.940]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
