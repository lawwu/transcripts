[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   I've always heard, oh, you leave the TV plugged in,
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.260]   you leave the computer plugged in.
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.660]   Even if they're off, they're still draining energy.
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.260]   Is that really where people should focus
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.260]   their time and energy?
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.640]   Or is it really about finding the major things
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.300]   that are causing drain?
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.280]   - It's the major things.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.300]   You wanna hit the low hanging fruit.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.940]   I mentioned my dehumidifier.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.020]   When we figured that out, it was like, wow,
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.020]   we saw our energy use decrease by like 20%
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.260]   just by making that one tweak.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.020]   When you're talking about a television set,
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.740]   it might be pulling two, three watts.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.580]   It does matter.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.380]   If you have multiple TVs and multiple game consoles
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.700]   and things like that that are just,
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700]   they're all sucking two, three, five watts,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660]   it does add up, but that's not where I would start at all.
