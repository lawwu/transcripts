[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.840]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I am your
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.520]   host and I have a unique show today for you that is very current. And in this show, we're
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.460]   going to talk about living the rich life. I am preempting the show that I've just recorded
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320]   and deleted, wherein I was answering more questions and continuing on the income theme
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.120]   because I think this is more timely. And I want to record some ideas here for you live
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.400]   in the moment. And I think you'll find these ideas to be helpful because they are related
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.360]   to living this rich life now. And it's about comparisons, comparing ourselves to others,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.500]   specifically with social media. I need three quick minutes of announcements. So bear with
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.760]   me for three quick minutes as we go through it. Announcement number one. If you are a
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.080]   patron of Radical Personal Finance, my apologies that I have not been able to post in the Patreon
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.680]   page. I'm presently locked out of my own Patreon account. I'm working very diligently with
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.600]   Patreon to get back in. It's a moderate length story, but basically I'll skip the story because
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520]   I want to do this in three minutes. I said there was a discount code in Patreon because
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.580]   I thought I would be able to get it in there by the time that that show where I said that
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.080]   was in there went live. Unfortunately, I haven't. So if you are a patron of mine, forgive me.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.800]   I'm working diligently to get back into the account, but I don't have it right now. So
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.080]   email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com for that coupon code, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.960]   and I'll get this squared away as soon as I can, working hard to get it back in there.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.880]   Thing number two, I was planning today to record a live Q&A show, but due to technical
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   issues, I am pushing that to Monday. And here is what I want to do. I want to invite you
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.200]   to join me on Monday, all of you. Well, any of you who are interested. Monday, May 14
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.800]   at 3 o'clock PM Eastern, join me using this phone number, 561-440-7362 for a live call
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.520]   coaching. Again, this coming Monday, May 14, 3 PM Eastern, 561-440-7362. Specifically,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.880]   and exclusively to talk with me about questions relating to your career and your income and
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.200]   how you can make more money. I want to turn this into, I guess, an AirSats coaching call
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.680]   to discuss with you some ideas and I'll, of course, release it as a public podcast, but
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.040]   join me on that call. Please don't call in if you just want to hear, I will release it
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.400]   as a podcast. Please only call in if you have a question. And if I get more than, say, a
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.600]   dozen callers, I'll lock the phone lines. If you call in and the phone lines are locked,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.540]   it means I had too many callers. Join me though, Monday, May 14, 3 PM. A few questions on frequently
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.000]   asked questions for the course. Again, right now we are in the launch phase for the Radical
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   Personal Finance Career and Income Guide, the increased income course that I have just
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.640]   polished off version two. Right now, until this coming Wednesday, May 15, is the lowest
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.160]   price. Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome to sign up. A couple of questions that have
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.600]   been coming in. People have been asking this question, "Will it always be available?" I've
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.920]   mentioned that I have a 12-week launch cycle here. Short answer is I intend to keep this
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.800]   open available to you who are buying it always, but I'm focused very much on providing a lot
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.720]   of service for you during the first 12 weeks. You don't have to complete it in the first
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.640]   12 weeks. I'm just trying to provide a lot of service for you. There's a balance between
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.400]   courses and products and training products and things like that that are always available
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.480]   because the content is static versus sometimes available. And for this particular module,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.200]   I feel that at least 50% of the benefit of the course is specific discussions around
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.240]   your specific needs. And I can't commit to doing that forever. But what I can commit
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.840]   to doing is doing that for the next 12 weeks. And so the course will be available on a launch
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   cycle, but you don't have to complete the content in the next 12 weeks. So if your next
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.040]   12 weeks are busy, that's fine. All of the calls and things will be recorded. All of
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.880]   the lessons are available for you to download the audio from, which is the most important
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.480]   thing. All of the notes are available. There's 56 pages of outline notes that you can download.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.160]   So you don't have to complete this in the first 12 weeks. It'll be available for you
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   to refer back to. And my operating philosophy is this. I want to always reward and incentivize
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   my customers who have been with me from the beginning. I would not be speaking to you
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.920]   today if there had not been a core group of members who supported me a few months into
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.200]   the show. I wouldn't be speaking to you today if there weren't people who signed up to be
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.000]   patrons of the show. I wouldn't be speaking to you today if there were not a beta group
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.960]   of initial students who signed up for the course. They believed in me when, I don't
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   know if you should have. I've done my best. But things have not been perfect. But people
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.520]   believed in me. And so for every one of you who shares your hard-earned money and spends
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.240]   it with me, I'm absolutely committed to giving you the best that I'm capable of. And so I
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.040]   want you to know that that's my operating philosophy, is to give you the best that I'm
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.340]   capable of and then to make it better in time. So my hope is, even with this course, to make
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.400]   it constantly better and better and better. And if the technology allows me to do it,
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   I'll try very hard to keep you having access to even the better future versions that are
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.920]   even better and more on point, et cetera. So final announcement is that if you have
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.940]   been thinking about the course, you've been thinking about signing up as I've started
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.960]   promoting it over the last few days, but you're interested but not that interested, I would
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:42.600]   love to know what you're thinking. When I first released this beta version of the course,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.280]   the initial response was super, super strong. The course sold out in the first week with
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.840]   a hundred students. This time it has been slower, slower than I expected. So I would
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.120]   love to know your feedback. If you're interested, but you're not quite sure about it, please
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.560]   email me at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com and tell me why. You don't even have to say
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.280]   anything. I'm not going to try to put you into a new sales funnel. I would like to just
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   know why, what your personal reservation is. Or if you are, just so I can know in the future
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   as I continue to get better, I want to make things that are really, really serving you.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.120]   So if you have a question specifically, email me joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. Tell
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.760]   me your question. If you say, "Joshua, I'd love to work with you, but I just not interested
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.320]   in income. Most of my audience is already earning a very high income. Tell me what you
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.440]   would most like to ask me about. Just shoot me a quick note. Do it right now, please,
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.280]   if you would. Just pause and shoot me a quick note, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com and
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.120]   tell me, "Hey Joshua, if we were sitting down for lunch, here is what I would most like
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.520]   to ask you about. Here's what I'm most interested in. That will help me because this is just
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.480]   the tip of the iceberg." All right, announcement's over and let's get back to what I want to
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.000]   talk with you today. And that is exposure to others and comparing
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   yourselves to others. My intention today was to record for you and I've recorded and dumped,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.840]   I recorded, I was planning to record a show responding to your Q&A. And I, today for the
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.520]   first time on since February 22, today on May 11, I signed into my Facebook account.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:28.240]   I had forced myself to stop going on Facebook back on February 22 because it was really
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:35.120]   damaging to my productivity. I was really struggling to figure out how do I get specifically
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.080]   the course finished? How do I get this done? I was months behind schedule, nothing was
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.160]   working, everything was locked up. I wasn't able to get things done and I was really frustrated
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   as far as why. And so one of the things that I found myself doing is interacting with y'all
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.680]   in the Facebook group. But then at that time, this was right after the Parkland shooting
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.160]   and all of a sudden everybody's upset about guns and gun control, blah, blah, blah. And
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:08.720]   I found myself, I exercised a lot of discipline, I engaged with one, one person's thread. And
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:16.400]   I quickly found myself seven hours later having lost seven hours. And I just said, "That's
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.880]   it." So I closed out. I said, "I cannot come back here until I launch." And I told my wife,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.360]   I said, "I'm not going back to social media until I launch." Well, it was a month and
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.280]   a half longer than I wanted it to be, but it was really interesting.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   Now this is in line with a number of other things in my life that I have done specifically
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   to limit my own usage of my phone. I've over the years, maybe you find it easy to exercise
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:51.920]   self-control, but I don't. I find myself, I don't know if this is a thing, I've self-diagnosed
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.120]   myself, which is always, of course, brilliant. But I think I have something of an addictive
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.160]   personality if that's a thing. I just use it to describe the fact that when I get into
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.240]   something I usually get really into something. And I usually don't stay with it for all that
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.760]   long, but when I get into something I usually get really deep. If I'm interested in something,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.120]   I'll go to the library and get 30 books and I'll go through all 30 of them. I'll read
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.600]   a dozen and go through all 30. If I'm interested in something, I'll watch hours of videos.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.960]   I'll search out everything I can on it. Now this has been very useful to me throughout
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.080]   my lifetime, but it also can be a real problem because I tend to go kind of deep. And it
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.840]   means that I always have more input, more input, more input. Over the years, I've studied
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.120]   my own kind of successes and failures. And in some ways I feel more successful than I've
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.640]   ever felt. But in some ways I feel like I'm always trying to get back to who I was somewhere
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.120]   around a decade to 15 years ago. This has been expressed in a number of ways, specifically
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.300]   with my attention span. When I talk with my friends in person, I've often diagnosed my
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:10.680]   own personal problem with attention to go back to the invention of tabbed browsing.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.760]   I remember the first time I had an internet browser that allowed you to open multiple
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:24.000]   tabs at once. I thought it was the greatest thing in the world because now instead of
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.920]   having to follow a thread through, you would click on a link, you would go forward, and
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.440]   if you wanted to go back, you had to go back, back, back. I could click on every link and
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:43.160]   open every thread. I thought it was wonderful. Now in this regard, I am in a very interesting
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:53.520]   position where in my current age bracket, I'm right on the transition between generations.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.720]   I am essentially a digital native where I didn't have to learn as an adult some of the
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.520]   web skills, et cetera. I'm a digital native. But I remember the early days. So people who
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.080]   are a decade younger than me, they don't have any idea what it's like to not have a smartphone.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   They don't have any idea what it's like to not have tabbed browsing. They don't have
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.520]   any idea what it's like to not have fast access internet. And so they almost can't conceive
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.480]   of what that is like. Some people who are older than me certainly remember what it's
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.240]   like, but frequently, unless it's a part of your daily life, you're not as hardcore of
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.160]   a user as someone like me is, where it's native for me. I'm pretty current on most technological
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.240]   approaches. So I'm right on this really interesting generation where I have remembrance of both.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   And I've often thought back to that tabbed browsing scenario. And to this day, I look
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:53.600]   and I say, "That was when my attention span started to fall." Before then, I have this
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.000]   impression, who knows if it's accurate, but I think it is. I have this impression of me
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.760]   with a very long attention span. I could sit and read difficult books. I could follow complex
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:16.360]   arguments. I could engage in extensive conversations. But when tabbed browsing came along, I developed
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:23.600]   a very much shortened attention span. And a few years after the invention of tabbed
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.360]   browsing, I remember sitting there watching myself not even able to finish a single article
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:39.400]   on a single page. I'm not exaggerating. I couldn't finish a single article on a single
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   page because I would be interested in the next one. Click, follow, click, follow, click,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.320]   follow. Oh, that looks like an interesting link. Click, follow, click, follow. A number
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.400]   of years back, I noticed that my attention span had evaporated. My ability to stay with
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.440]   something, stay with a hard job had evaporated. And so I've worked hard to pull back from
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:06.240]   it with varying levels of success. But it's been a continual challenge over the last five
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:16.320]   years to say, I need to make sure that I'm focused, focused, focused. And I've especially
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:24.200]   been working on that the last six months. Focused, focused, focused. I've also come
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.560]   to the point where I identified that there were a number of things that I liked that
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:34.360]   weren't helping me. And because they were easy, I was doing the easy things and not
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.680]   the hard things. So let me give you some examples of some things I've done as I tell you what
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:50.720]   happened today. Simple example, YouTube. I, as most men, I really enjoy videos, YouTube
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.200]   videos. I've never enjoyed broadcast TV. I've never really consumed broadcast TV, but it's
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.640]   not it just it's not me. I can't stand to hear a laugh track. I acknowledge that there
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.280]   are some very well done TV shows, but I generally have just avoided most of them. But individual
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.040]   created video is is is powerful for me. I really love it because I can exercise that
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:18.680]   interest that I have in weird, esoteric topics and I can follow that interest to its very
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:27.520]   end. But over the years, YouTube became deadly because I could just click subscribe and follow
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.720]   the recommended videos. And as YouTube has perfected their algorithms, there's always
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.000]   a list of things that I'm interested in and they're perfectly curated for me. I don't
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.360]   remember the exact timing, but maybe a year ago, I said, this is not helpful. I'm spending
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.420]   hours and hours every week on YouTube. This is not good. And I tried various things, fits
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:54.160]   and starts, but I wound up taking the step of actually completely deleting my YouTube
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.400]   account, completely deleted the Google account that was associated with it, completely deleted
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.160]   all the history. And I completely removed all of removed the YouTube app from my phone
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.840]   and I completely removed any saved cookies from YouTube. So today, when I actually if
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.560]   I log on to YouTube, it's been really good because if I log on to YouTube, there's never
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.680]   a search history of what I've watched, which is also good for privacy. I don't want to
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.080]   create a long extensive search history of what I'm watching, but it's also really good
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.480]   for me. I always see that front page of YouTube and it's never curated content. I was previously
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.040]   subscribed to hundreds and hundreds of channels. From time to time, I'll allow myself to go
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.240]   and watch video, but I make myself remember the channel name. If I can't remember it,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:46.800]   it's obviously not that important. And my YouTube viewership collapsed in terms of time
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.840]   and I gained a huge amount of time back. It was really, really healthy for me, really
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.340]   helpful. It also helped me to not live in such an echo chamber because certainly as
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.240]   I would watch a video and then watch another video, then the algorithm would start to try
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:07.160]   to give me videos that I was interested in. But my entire experience wasn't curated just
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:18.000]   to myself. So I would see a more diverse array of videos. Well, that was good. But then it
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.520]   continued on and I'm going to skip giving you any kind of timeline because this is fits
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:28.320]   and starts over time. But other things that I did, I completely removed social media from
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.120]   my phone. I had an experience that really struck me because it was very visible. For
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.320]   me, my children and my wife are very important to me. And one of the basic structures of
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:47.800]   our lives that we have fully committed to is that our family eats together. And for
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.960]   the most part, we eat together at least two meals a day. Now, what I found is generally,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.760]   even though I usually work from home, I skip lunch with my family because it's right in
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.880]   the middle of my most productive hours. But we would try to always have breakfast together
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.000]   and dinner together. And if something's going to fail, I want to make sure that we always
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.280]   have dinner together. That is deeply important to me. It's a priority for us. I remember
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   I was arguing with somebody one time on Facebook and I remember sitting there and I had it
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.640]   on my phone and it was just so easy for me to get that phone and go and look. That I
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.600]   remember getting up from the table, didn't need to get up, but getting up from the table,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.240]   going to the bathroom with my cell phone so I could look to see if somebody had responded
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.320]   to me on Facebook and if somebody had given my brilliant point back to me so I could figure
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.800]   out what's the next rebuttal that I could give them in their argument. Now, maybe you're
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.680]   not an arguer. I certainly am a debater. I enjoy interesting things and debating points
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.640]   and philosophy and principles, et cetera. That's me. Maybe yours is different. I don't
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.760]   guess that you would be like me. But I was really embarrassed and I'm embarrassed even
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:08.160]   to say that because here's my family. Here's my wife and my children who I love and I want
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.680]   to be with. But because it's easier for me to go and argue with someone online, I'm physically
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.400]   removing myself from the space with my family to go and check Facebook. Well, over time
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.240]   I completely removed all social media apps from my phone. That was really good. It brought
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:33.600]   me a lot of peace. I removed all work email from my phone. That was really good. So then
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   instead of getting a nasty email from a listener, "Joshua, you said this hateful blah, blah,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.200]   blah, blah," then I just wouldn't bother. I can go when I'm in work mode. I go to work
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   mode, I open my email, I close it and I'm done. I don't all of a sudden pull out my
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.040]   phone while I'm with my family and we're going to go to the park and, "Oh, there's an email.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.880]   There's another one. Another person mad at me on the internet. Great." Or another nasty
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   review. "Joshua sucks at blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," for whatever reason. So that
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:12.800]   was a good move. Now, as time has gone by, I've taken it even farther. One of the things
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:21.320]   that I did is I learned that, okay, I'd removed the YouTube app from my phone. That was helpful.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.280]   But then I still had the YouTube app, but I still had an internet browser. So I could,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.640]   of course, go to YouTube and open up the internet browser and watch. Well, I had not set a rule
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.120]   that I wasn't going to do that. But in time, I realized that, "Wow, I'm now spending a
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.240]   lot of time on video still, again, even though I didn't have the app." So I went to the step
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:52.600]   of actually completely removing the internet from my phone. I totally deleted the...and
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.120]   if you're interested in how to do this, I don't know how to do it on Android, but on
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:02.240]   an iPhone, the browser that I...well, I usually would use a browser called Snow Haze, which
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.880]   gives you a little bit more granular control. If you're looking for a good browser to use
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   that is a little bit better, Snow Haze is a good one. It does a good job. So I removed
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.600]   that. And then I removed Safari from the phone. Now, you can't actually remove Safari. If
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.440]   you're interested in doing this, as I tell you about it, feel free. But you can't actually
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:26.520]   fully remove Safari. But you can, in the Restrictions tab, go into the Parental Restrictions tab
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:33.160]   on your phone, and you can set up a code that is a four-digit PIN. And in that four-digit
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.200]   PIN, you can remove Safari. And that way, it's not available to you. You don't have
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.480]   the internet, the browser available to you. Now, of course, you still have to exercise
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:49.560]   your own...this is a self-restraint thing here that we're doing. But...and then for
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.760]   a time, I remembered the PIN. Now, my productivity went up, but then I would every now and then
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.120]   go ahead and just unlock the restrictions so I could use it. Finally, I just changed
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.920]   the PIN so I wouldn't even know what it was. And I kept on deleting apps. So I systematically
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.320]   deleted apps, deleted apps, deleted apps, deleted apps, deleted apps, deleted apps.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:18.920]   And my phone usage shrank and shrank and shrank and shrank. And as I did that, my happiness
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:26.600]   and my ability to be present increased. I was able to make progress. I felt less stuck.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.720]   And by consuming, instead of constantly consuming these little just hits of tiny little content,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.560]   I increased my reading. I increased my reading in things that were helping my brain, ideas
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:45.040]   that were challenging to me, super, super helpful. I didn't really realize how good
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:53.080]   my mental state was. I observed some effects of it. And I look at life a lot through...as
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.240]   a father, I look at it and say, "Well, how would I advise my children?" And as I drive
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.720]   around sometimes I see children at bus stops and I look and I just observe that the vast
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.080]   majority of them usually, as they're standing at the bus stop, have their neck down, head
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.120]   in the phone. You go anywhere, head in the phone, head in the phone, head in the phone.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.000]   And I know I sound like an old curmudgeon, but I'm like, "Man, this is not good." In
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.120]   my own experience, I can empathize with the addiction, but I can also empathize with the
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:34.200]   reality of it being better without it. So for weeks now, my phone has basically been
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:41.320]   totally useless in the sense of there's nothing on it. The only thing that's on it is a couple
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.800]   of simple communications apps for me to talk with the very few people that have my actual
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:55.880]   communications apps. And the piece increased. Now, it's a bad financial move. I got a
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.960]   thousand-dollar phone that thankfully it's not brand new, but my time on it basically
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   has gone to nothing. And I didn't realize how good my mental state was until I logged
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:16.720]   into Facebook today. Now back to Facebook. I set myself a rule and I locked myself out.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.080]   Now, over the last few years, I've deleted LinkedIn, I deleted Instagram, I deleted a
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.360]   bunch of other things as well. But I just said, "These things are not good. They're
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.200]   not helpful. They're not useful. All they are is noise and nonsense, and they don't
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.520]   actually help in anything that matters." I'm not denying that they can be useful for a
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.840]   few small places, a few small cases. I'm not denying that they can be exploited by certain
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.680]   people who are interesting to use them, but I don't want to play those games. So I've
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:50.520]   gotten rid of a lot, but the two that I still have are Facebook and Twitter. And so a while
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.120]   ago, on February 22, I closed out my Facebook account. I put a note in the Radical Personal
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.160]   Finance Facebook group and I said, "Guys, I can't. I got to get out of here. This is
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:05.920]   bad." And what's happening is that my being on Facebook, because it's easy, is causing
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.000]   me to miss my goals. I am six months behind schedule on everything that I had intended
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.280]   to do six months ago. I don't like being behind schedule. That hurts my pride. That hurts
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.320]   my self-image. That hurts my productivity. That hurts my ability to serve you when I
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.520]   can't get things done. And so I put a note in the Facebook group and said, "Sorry, I
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.880]   got to go." I haven't logged in since February 22. Did the same thing with Twitter, deleted
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.640]   all my tweets, and the only thing that was there for a while is just simply the show
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:50.320]   automatically publishing. When I publish, it goes to Twitter. And so I got out of that
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.440]   until today.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:59.480]   Now, generally, when you're part of something every day, you don't really realize how it
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.240]   affects you. Think about it in terms of your own house. Have you ever noticed that other
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:12.160]   people's houses smell but your own doesn't? I go to other people's houses and it's like,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.720]   "That's weird." I come to my own and, "Ah, it smells great." But I know that other people
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.400]   come into my house, especially we have dogs and old carpet, and I'm kind of embarrassed
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:29.600]   about how my house sometimes probably doesn't smell great, but I can't smell it. And the
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.840]   point is, when you're in it, you can't smell it. When you're in something, you can't really
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.560]   feel it.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.240]   So I logged into Facebook today and I started answering listener questions. And I didn't
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.360]   go and look at my newsfeed. It wasn't a matter of the newsfeed, but I started just checking
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.640]   a little bit here, checking a little bit there. All of a sudden, I started seeing this personal
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:55.840]   finance conversation and that personal finance conversation. I see this group and that group.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:05.040]   About an hour ago, I'm sitting here just feeling utterly worthless. I'm thinking, "Yeah, I've
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.440]   been out of Facebook, but man, everyone's doing better than I am." I'm looking at all
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.960]   of my other friends who have financial podcasts and financial communities, and I'm thinking,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.160]   "They're doing better than I am. They have bigger communities than I have. Look at how
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:26.760]   fancy their stuff is, and my stuff stinks."
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:33.680]   This morning, the Joshua of early this morning, Friday, when I got up this morning, I was
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:44.080]   feeling great. When I got to work, I was feeling great. I was confident. I was focused. I've
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:55.440]   got a plan. I'm working on it. I was feeling great. I didn't spend that much time on Facebook.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:04.000]   I pulled up my Twitter account, answered a few people. An hour ago, I realized self-confidence
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:12.640]   shot. Everyone's better than me. Poor little old me. What's wrong with me? Why can't I
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.840]   do what other people are doing? Why does their stuff work? Why is my stuff not? Why don't
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.760]   I have 50,000 people who've signed up for my course? Everyone else did. Everyone else
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.040]   has had this. What's wrong with me? Poor little old me.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:38.160]   I say this to you because it took me a little while, and I just figured out. That's what
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:45.200]   happened. Now, we talk about comparing ourselves to the Joneses, and there's all kinds of people
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.680]   who've written about this issue. If you haven't read about this as far as the comparing ourselves
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.160]   to other people, you're living under a rock. I'm not trying to repeat all of those articles
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.720]   that you've read. People have said, "Well, when we compare ourselves to others online
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:04.600]   and we're seeing this carefully curated, perfect life that everyone else, which is all lies,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:10.720]   tiny little moments carefully edited to post online, it just makes us feel down about ourselves
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.280]   because my life doesn't look like that." Now, I'm not a beauty blogger, vlogger. I'm not
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:24.360]   a beauty Instagrammer. I don't follow things to talk about how you look, but some people
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:39.200]   do. But it took the person who's posting the perfect, candid 87 tries to get it right.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.640]   And then you look in the mirror and you say, "I don't look so good." Their outfit was months
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.000]   of work. You look in the mirror and say, "I don't look so good." Or maybe that's not your
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.480]   thing. You look at their perfect family photo, but you can't hear the audio of how that was
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:05.200]   the only family photo in an evening of frustration. Or maybe you're like me with your business
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:13.520]   and it looks like everybody has it so easy. What's wrong with me? Poor little old me.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.960]   It was funny because what reminded me of this was somebody's post in my Facebook group.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:32.660]   Way back in the Radical Personal Finance archives, I recorded a show and it was about not comparing
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:39.760]   yourself to other people. And on that show, I had just seen, I had been working hard.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.400]   I think it was episode 135. It was called Be Confident in Your Unique Offering and then
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:59.440]   Stick to Your Knitting, January 15, 2015. And what had happened in that show was the
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.880]   lady who has the podcast, a really good podcast, Farnoosh. Farnoosh Tarabi had just published
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   her show. And I had been before Farnoosh, I'd been interested in personal finance and
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.440]   I was struggling with radical personal finance. I was struggling. And all of a sudden, Farnoosh
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:23.000]   launches her podcast and here's Farnoosh, Miss Public Media Creator extraordinaire,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.600]   and she has Tony Robbins for her inaugural episode. And I just felt worthless. I sat
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.120]   down and I thought, what's wrong with me? Everyone else is better than me. And I recorded
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.600]   that show saying that, I said, be confident in your unique offering and then just stick
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.620]   with what you can do. Like you can't be everyone else. I don't want to be Farnoosh. She's wonderful,
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:50.440]   but I'm sure she has all kinds of problems. That's not me. It's not what I want to do.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.200]   And then finding this Facebook comment from my listener posted to my group saying, I just
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.000]   found your episode 135 and it really was so helpful for me. I couldn't even remember what
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.520]   I was talking about. But when I thought it back through, I realized, you know what? For
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:16.600]   the last few hours, I have been in the same mental state that I was on January 15, 2015,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:24.080]   because I was comparing myself to others because I'm on Facebook. Now, somebody who tries to
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:32.440]   practice what I preach, I try to mean what I say and say what I mean. I try to always
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:39.480]   tell the truth. I try to be clear and to not say something that I don't believe, but to
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.880]   say the things I do believe. That's embarrassing. To look back almost three years later and
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:52.120]   say the same emotion I was dealing with three years ago, I still have that. But it was the
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:33:01.160]   clarity of me recognizing I haven't had that until I turned on Facebook. Now, my
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.360]   relationship with Facebook is somewhat unique because as someone who makes their living
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.680]   online, it's very hard to just say, well, I'm anti-Facebook. I'm anti-Facebook. And for a
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.360]   long time, I have been fully intending to be completely out of Facebook. I see no benefit
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   from it. I could give the business case and I'm not going to do that here. But basically,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:30.400]   I've lost any trust I ever had in any of these companies to actually to not change in the
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.600]   middle of what they think. I've lost any trust. But I certainly see how I could use
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:43.240]   Facebook to grow my business. But you know what? If me growing my business on Facebook
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:50.760]   causes me to constantly be engaged in comparing myself to people, and it causes me to
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:34:00.720]   lose my self-confidence, and it causes me to think poor little old me, no chance. It's not
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.280]   worth it.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:15.000]   Now for you, I share my thoughts not to tell you what to do. But I will say this. This show is
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.680]   dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, today's insight, and
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:34.600]   encouragement, today's encouragement, that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now. My
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:43.400]   question for you is, is your phone and your computer keeping you from living a rich and
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:50.960]   meaningful life now? I know for me, mine sure has. Now I've shared some of my
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.920]   successes, and I've had a lot of success in this. Tell you what, I like not caring about my
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:09.760]   phone. I leave it behind more and more, don't use it. I'm down to exactly 11 apps, 11 apps at
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:17.200]   the moment. Not a single one of them is interesting. They're purely utility. I could
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:27.320]   probably cut out even those. At this point in time, the only reason that I could make for
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:33.440]   having a smartphone for me right now, based upon how much better my life has been by not using the
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:42.720]   smartphone, is simply that I value secure private communication. I can't do that with a flip
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.200]   phone, but blah, blah, blah. I can't, you know, I can't do that with a phone. I work hard to get all my
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:54.520]   friends off of phone lines. I work hard to get all my friends off of unencrypted email. I work hard to get
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.360]   all my friends to use secure messengers and to use encrypted email, and I can't do that with a feature
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:08.760]   phone. But I'll tell you this, there's not a chance in the world I'd buy this phone again. I loved it when I
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:15.920]   bought it. I was so excited. There's not a chance in the world I'd buy it again, at least not right now, in my
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.280]   current needs structure. So consider trying it. If you want to live in rich and meaningful life now,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:33.760]   consider trying it. Frankly, I don't even have service on the phone right now. I completely quit cell
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:41.040]   phone connection. I have an emergency phone that I sometimes carry so that my wife can get ahold of me if
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.520]   necessary, but we're together most of the time. I don't even have cell phone service on the phone. It just
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:53.880]   lives on Wi-Fi, and I only use it for a few messaging apps, just so I don't have to communicate in text
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:09.080]   messages and email. It has been awesome. My life has been measurably, measurably improved. My
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:15.960]   self-confidence has been high. My productivity has been high. My interest has been strong. I've been
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:23.160]   actually able to get stuff done. I've actually been able to learn things and read weird books that interest
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:33.000]   me, that don't, they're so much more rewarding than mindlessly flipping and flipping and flicking and flicking.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.600]   My relationship with my family is better. Now I'm not sitting at the dinner table wondering what's on my
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.800]   phone. I know there's nothing on my phone because my phone doesn't even work. It's just, yeah, just has some
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.960]   apps on there. And since nobody talks to me on those, you know, I only have, you know, how often do you
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   actually interact with close friends? Maybe you're more than me, but it's not that big a deal. In every way,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:10.240]   I've had a visceral experience of things being better without the phone, without social media, without some
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:18.000]   of those other things. Now, you're listening to me right now on a podcast, probably on your phone. One of the
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.760]   very few apps that I have, still have as a podcast app. It's kind of, would be a little bit hypocritical for me to
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:35.760]   have a podcast app and then, or to have a podcast and then not have a podcast app, wouldn't it? But you know what?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:47.400]   I've got a client of mine I've worked with for a long time. This client is very, very successful. A lot of
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:58.840]   businesses, a lot of money, does very well. Month ago, this client, very successful person, was just frustrated
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:08.640]   with their own troubles. Lack of ability to execute on their to-do list. And we're sitting going over the same
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:19.880]   things month after month after month. No progress. His solution? He deleted his podcast app, started playing
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:28.920]   classical music instead. Immediately reported to me a significant increase in productivity. Making major
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:39.760]   progress again. So if my podcast is causing you to not make progress towards your goals, I recommend -- this is a
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:48.440]   client that found me through my podcast. He doesn't listen to my podcast anymore, because he's done with podcasts. I
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:57.000]   recommend to you, listen, your life is what matters. Your goals are what matter. Your priorities are what matter.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:05.880]   It's your life. It's your family. These are your children. My children are never going to be where they're at
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:13.720]   right now. I am not going to miss their life because I'm staring at the screen on my phone. I still have my
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   podcast app, but you know what I don't have? I deleted my Kindle app. I deleted my iBooks. And just in case
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.280]   you're curious why, it's not that I don't like to read. It's not that I don't read digital books. But it's that
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:34.920]   ability to focus. I really quit reading on the phone because with the phone, it's so easy to see the next
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:40.760]   notification. It's so easy to click over and say, "Oh, I'll just research that interesting thing." So I have a
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   standalone Kindle and I have a standalone -- well, I have a standalone e-readers and Kindles that aren't
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.920]   connected to anything. They don't have data. They don't have anything. I put the book on them and that way I'm
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:59.240]   actually just sitting and reading the book and building that attention span. So I wrap this up to say, I'm not
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:11.560]   going to let my life be stolen because Facebook and YouTube and Twitter want to sell me. Not going to do it.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:21.800]   I've threatened for a long time to totally delete, get out of Facebook, even radical personal finance off it and
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:30.600]   everything. That's kind of a business discussion. I think social media marketing is wildly overblown in terms of
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:39.720]   its impact. Wildly overblown. I see that it can be used by people for certain ends, but those ends are more
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:50.280]   specific. Wildly overblown. So I am 99% sure that -- and we've worked hard. We've got a forum that's built behind
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.320]   the scenes with radical personal finance where I can interact with you in a specific forum that's not on social
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:01.360]   media, etc. It's not quite ready to publish yet. Right now, still working on this course launch, but hopefully
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.840]   next couple of weeks it should be published on the site and I'll share with you more about that. But I'm not
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.360]   going to let my life be stolen by Facebook, let alone the data and all that stuff. One of the things I don't
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.760]   like is I don't like coming out when everyone else is on the delete Facebook bandwagon. I prefer not to be
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:30.360]   normal. But it's true. Constantly assess -- as I close, I share this stream of consciousness. This is real. Right
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:40.080]   now it's 4/11 in the afternoon on Friday afternoon. When I got up at 5 o'clock this morning, I was feeling
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:49.720]   great. When I was working, I was feeling great. About 11 o'clock, I signed on to Facebook. At 2 o'clock, I
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:58.640]   realized how my mental state was impacted from the fact that I had signed on to Facebook, started looking
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:09.240]   around, I had signed on to Twitter. And I'm telling you about it now. At the very least, give yourself a break.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:17.320]   Try it if you haven't tried it. Fasting is really important. You know, most religious traditions, the
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:22.120]   Christian tradition certainly does have this. Many religious traditions have this. In some religious
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:28.280]   traditions, fasting is kind of a farce, where, yeah, we fast, but we feast at the same time. But fasting is
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:35.480]   really valuable. When you fast, whether that's from food, or with, of course, many people fast from other
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:43.840]   things and have their thing that they give up. But fasting allows you to appreciate something more. And if
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:51.000]   you haven't done it, try putting yourself on a fast. And try to figure out a way to so that you don't have to
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.160]   rely on your willpower. If anything that I've said, if you want to try it for yourself and see if it helps you or
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:08.000]   doesn't help you, then just try it. But here's some ideas of how to do it. I don't ever want to be addicted to
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.760]   something. I don't ever want something to be in control of me. So from time to time, you know, over the last few
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.400]   years, from time to time, I'll quit coffee. I enjoy drinking coffee every day. I really enjoy getting up and
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.480]   having a cup of coffee. That is a valuable part of my life. But I don't want to be addicted to coffee. So from time to
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.840]   time, I stop completely. And I always appreciate it when I go back to it. And I say, No, I really value having that
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:36.280]   cup of coffee. I really like to have a cup of coffee in the morning. It really is nice. So when I go back to it, I know
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.920]   that I value it. But other things that I've given up, I don't value. I've learned, Oh, you know what, I don't actually
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.640]   value it. So here's what I would do. If any of this sparks anything for you, here's what I'll just share as far as my
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.400]   experience. In our modern world, it is almost impossible to keep up with, it is impossible to keep up with
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:03.640]   everything. So don't try sometimes. Here are some ideas you take and pick. I've tried these all in different
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:12.720]   contexts. If you have a bunch of subscriptions, start over. If you're listening to me right now on a podcast app, and
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   you have 70 podcasts, or 30 podcasts, just for fun, just delete the app. Or delete all your podcasts. Go a week with
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.960]   no podcast and then think which of those do I really want to listen to? And resubscribe to the ones that you really
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:41.080]   want to listen to. You probably won't resubscribe to 30 or 70, you probably resubscribe to a handful. Try it. Same
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:49.120]   thing with YouTube. Most of my audience is male. Most men are heavily oriented towards video. We spend a lot of
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:56.560]   time on things like YouTube. Try my thing. Consider deleting your YouTube account. You can always get another
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.120]   one. But delete the Google account that's associated with your YouTube. Clear all your history. That's good for
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.520]   your privacy as well. So delete all your comments. Google doesn't need that. They're selling you. Delete your
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.360]   YouTube account. And try what I did. Yeah, give yourself the permission to still go on YouTube. But instead of
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:18.320]   being subscribed everywhere, you got to actually remember and go check those people's subscriptions. Or consider
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:26.080]   doing that on social media. I've done that. At one point, I actually completely unfollowed thousands of people on
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:33.880]   Facebook. Then what I learned is I actually missed being able to find people at that time. That was a couple years
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.280]   ago. I missed being able to get a sense of what's happening. I went back and re-followed everyone. This stuff's
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:43.720]   not permanent. But same thing on Twitter. I completely unfollowed everyone on Twitter. Now if I want to check
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.440]   someone on Twitter, and this has been for a long time, but now if I want to check someone on Twitter, I have to go
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:53.920]   and actually look at their feed. So that way it's just my brain working instead of the algorithms controlling
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:01.160]   me. I'm thinking proactively, "Oh, you know what? I want to go and see what this person is saying." Instead of
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:09.080]   the algorithm saying, "Here, here, here, come see me." Give it a try. See if it works. Try deleting it from your
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:18.880]   phone. I see nothing good from social media on your phone. The routine that most people seem to make, roll up in
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.920]   bed before you even get out of bed, checking social media. Before you go to sleep, checking social media.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:32.400]   Friends, it's not healthy. It's very bad for relationships. I don't have any research data that I can present on
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:40.960]   this. But in most of the people that I've talked to over the last few years, who have been going through
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:52.600]   divorce, personal friends, family, people I interact with, I often have taken to asking this question, "Tell me
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:48:06.560]   about Facebook." Frequently, Facebook is involved. Now, it's not always involved in infidelity. But man, I can
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:16.040]   sure see how it frequently is. I was talking with my wife about it the other day. There was a girl that I'm
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:23.560]   friends with on Facebook from years and years ago. I had a major crush on the girl for a long time. And of
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.600]   course, in the world of Facebook, it's always interesting to say, "Oh, let me go and see what that girl's up to.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:36.800]   Go and look at her profile and see what's up." You've done it. Of course you have. We all do. And I was
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:42.360]   thinking about it. I was talking to my wife and I was saying, "You know, I don't have any romantic feelings for
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.000]   that girl. It was a long time ago." Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking at the time, but I guess I
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:59.920]   wasn't. It was all unthinking. But I was talking to my wife and I said, "You know, I can see how it starts right
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:10.520]   there. If my wife and I were having a tough time and our relationship were not warm and fun at the moment, how
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:17.320]   easy would it be for me to go and obsess on that other girl? How easy would it be for me to just say, 'Oh, hey,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:27.880]   how you doing?' To all of a sudden start talking. The talking continues. And one thing leads to another.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:36.600]   Happens all the time. I spoke with a man a couple years ago. He'd just gotten divorced from his wife. We were
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.560]   talking about it and he said, "You know, it was not so bad that during dinner, I'd be there at the dinner table
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.320]   with the children, two little girls. She'd be over on the couch in the living room on Facebook. I didn't know what
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:58.680]   she was doing. But come to find out, she was developing a relationship with another man. This is bad. That's an
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.800]   expensive thing to go through a divorce. So let me just simply say, you can come up with your own reasons. I've
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   got all kinds of them. I think I'll go ahead and in today's site, I'll post a pretty good couple of articles in the
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:21.320]   comments on the sorry, in the notes for today's show on just reasons to consider picking on Facebook. It's not part
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.840]   of it is specifically Facebook's fault. I hate to beat up on someone when they're being beaten up on. It's just that
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:33.200]   Facebook is they bought everybody else and they're the giant thing, the giant force. But it's not just them. For
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:39.680]   some people, it's Facebook. For some people, it's YouTube. For some people, it's something else. But you assess
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:49.800]   your own life, be an adult and think about your own consideration. But that's my experience. My enjoyment, my
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:51:00.320]   rich life today has been measurably improved by my smartphone basically becoming a stupid phone. Just a
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:09.680]   little bit of communication apps on it. And my computer and online experience being free of videos and free of
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:18.760]   social media accounts. And in three hours, after almost three months of absence and three hours, my productivity
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:26.200]   dropped, I wasted time, my self-image dropped, my self-confidence dropped. I started comparing myself to other
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:33.080]   people. People that if I said, and specifically, I'm talking about friends who have mine who are fellow
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:42.880]   podcasters, fellow financial people, started comparing myself to them, I started to feel worthless. If I were
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:49.960]   physically with these people, I would feel great. I would be thrilled about their success. They would be
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.040]   thrilled with mine. We'd have a great conversation. We all have unique things to offer. We're all pursuing unique
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.120]   things. And they would say, "Hey, here's what's working. Here's what's not working." They would share their
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:05.520]   struggles. I would share my struggles. We would, in person, or when talking, we would build each other up.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:18.120]   Whereas Facebook fueled my jealousy. That is not a good emotion. Happy Friday, everybody. Remember, launch
