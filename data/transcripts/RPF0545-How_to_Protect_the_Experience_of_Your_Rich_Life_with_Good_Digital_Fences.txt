[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.760]   I'll skip the story because I want to do this in three minutes. I said there was a discount code
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.420]   in Patreon because I thought I would be able to get it in there by the time that that show where

So people who are a decade younger than me, they don't have any idea what it's like to not have a smartphone. They don't have any idea what it's like to not have tabbed browsing. They don't have any idea what it's like to not have fast access internet. And so they almost can't conceive of what that is like. Some people who are older than me certainly remember what it's like. But frequently, unless you are, it's a part of your daily life, you're not as familiar as you are.

And because they were easy, I was doing the easy things and not the hard things. So let me give you some examples of some things I've done as I tell you what happened today.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   I've never really consumed broadcast TV, but it's not me. I can't stand to hear a laugh track. I acknowledge that there are some very well done TV shows, but I've generally just avoided most of them. But individual created video is powerful for me. I really love it because I can exercise that interest that I have in my life.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:41.540]  obediently focused. And I can follow that interest to its very end. But over the years, YouTube became deadly because I could just click subscribe and follow the recommended videos. And as YouTube has perfected their algorithms, there's always a list of things that I'm interested in, and they're perfectly curated for me. I don't remember the exact timing, but maybe a year ago, I said, this is not helpful.

[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.360]   from the space with my family
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.080]   to go and check Facebook.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.600]   Well, over time,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.900]   I completely removed
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.400]   all social media apps from my phone.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.360]   That was really good.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.760]   It brought me a lot of peace.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.480]   I removed all work email from my phone.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   That was really good.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.900]   So then instead of, you know,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.380]   getting a nasty email from a listener
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   ĞšĞ¾Ñ€inna,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   and I removed all work email
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   from my phone.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   That was really good.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   So then instead of, you know,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   getting a nasty email from a listener

[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   That was really good.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   So then instead of, you know,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.380]   getting a nasty email from a listener
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:20:06.400]   and I removed all work email from my phone
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   and I removed all work email from my phone
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:36.420]   ìŠê³ , I'm going to remove all work email from my phone.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   Now as time has gone by,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   I've taken it even farther.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   One of the things that I did is I learned that,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   I'd removed the YouTube app from my phone.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   That was helpful.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   But then I still had the YouTube app and,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   but I still had, sorry, I still had an internet browser.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   So I could, of course, go to YouTube and open up the internet browser and watch. Well, I had not set a rule that I wasn't going to do that.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   So, but in time I realized that
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   I was able to do that because I had a lot of things that I knew I didn't know how to do,
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   but I still had an internet browser.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   So I could, of course, go to YouTube and open up the internet browser and watch. Well, I had not set a rule that I wasn't going to do that.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:21:06.440]  , but I still had an internet browser.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   So I went to the step of actually completely removing the internet from my phone. I totally deleted the, if you're interested in how to do this, I don't know how to do it on Android, but on my phone, the browser that I, well, I usually would use a browser called Snow Haze, which gives you a little bit more granular control if you're looking for a good browser to use.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   If you're looking for a good browser to use,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   If you're looking for a good browser to use,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   if you're looking for a good browser to use,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   if you're looking for a good browser to use,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   if you're looking for a good browser to use,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   I removed that.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   If you're interested in doing this, as I tell you about it, feel free, but you can't actually fully remove Safari, but you can in the restrictions tab, go into the parental restrictions tab on your phone and you can set up a code that is a four digit pin.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   And in that four digit pin, you can remove Safari.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   And that way it doesn't,
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   It doesn't take away from you and you can actually remove Safari.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   And then you can set up a code that is a four digit pin and in that four digit pin, you can remove Safari and that way it doesn't take away from
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   That way it doesn't take away from you and you can set up a code that is a four digit pin and in that four digit pin and in that four digit pin you can remove Safari and that way it doesn't
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   that way it doesn't take away from you can't do that.

[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:59.820]   sau a while ago, February 22, I closed out my Facebook account. I put a note in the radical personal finance Facebook group, and I said, Guys, I can't, I gotta get out of here. This is bad.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.120]   And what's happening is,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   I'm not denying that they can be useful for a few small places, few small cases. I'm not denying that they can be exploited by certain people who are interesting to use them, but I don't want to play those games. I've gotten rid of a lot, but the two that I still have are Facebook and Twitter.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   And so a while ago, February 22, I closed out my Facebook account. I put a note in the radical personal finance Facebook group and I said, Guys, I've gotta get out of here. This is bad.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:29.260]  , and so I put a note in the radical personal finance Facebook group and I said, "Sorry, I gotta go."
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:58.400]  , and so I put a note in the radical personal finance Facebook group and I said, "Sorry, I gotta go."
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   I haven't logged in since February 22. I did the same thing with Twitter, deleted all my tweets and the only thing that was there for a while is just simply the show automatically publishing when I publish it goes to Twitter. And so I got out of that until today.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:27.540]   You realize how it affects you. You know, think about it in terms of your own house. You ever notice that other people's houses smell but your own doesn't? I go to other people's houses and it's like, "Huh, that's weird." I come to my own and, "Ah, it smells great." But I know that other people come into my house, and especially we have dogs and old carpet, and I'm kind of embarrassed about how my house sometimes probably doesn't smell great, but I can't smell it. And it's, you know, I'm a little bit more of a fan of the show, and I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   I'm a little bit more of a fan of the show, and I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:56.780]  , and I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:56.880]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:56.980]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.040]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.080]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.

[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.280]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:57.380]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:57.380]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:57.480]   and I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.620]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   And I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.220]   utterly worthless.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.620]   I'm thinking,
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.120]   Yeah, you know, I've been out of Facebook,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.920]   but man, everyone's doing better than I am.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.620]   I'm looking at all of my other friends
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.420]   who have financial podcasts and financial communities,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.020]   and I'm thinking, they're doing better than I am.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.720]   They have bigger communities than I have.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.920]   Look at how fancy their stuff is, and my stuff stinks.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:56.860]  ,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   Yeah, I think that it's going to be a thing that I want to do.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   Yeah, you know, I'm thinking, they're doing better than I am.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   I'm thinking, they're doing better than I am.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   I'm thinking, they're doing better than I am.

[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:21.880]   and I'm a very successful client, very successful person, just frustrated with their own troubles. Lack of ability to execute on their to-do list. And we're sitting going over the same things month after month after month. No progress. His solution? He deleted his podcast app. Started playing classical music instead. Immediately reported to me a significant increase in his audience.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   I recommend, this is a client that found me through my podcast. He doesn't listen to my podcast anymore because he's done with podcasts. I recommend to you, listen, your life is what matters.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   I recommend to you, listen, your life is what matters. I recommend to you, listen, your life is what matters. I recommend to you, listen, your life is what matters.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:40:10.540]   I recommend to you, listen, your goals are what matter. Your priorities are what matter. It's your life. It's your family. These are your children. My children are never going to be where they're at right now. I am not going to miss their life because I'm staring at the screen of my phone.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:18.540]   I still have my podcast app, but you know what I don't have? I deleted my Kindle app.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.040]   I deleted my Kindle app.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:49.000]   I deleted my iBooks.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.060]   And just in case you're curious why, it's not that I don't like to read. It's not that I don't read digital books, but it's that ability to focus. I really quit reading on the phone because with the phone it's so easy to see the next notification. It's so easy to click over and say, "Oh, I'll just research that interesting thing." So I have a standalone Kindle and I have a standalone e-readers and Kindles that aren't connected to anything. They don't have a standalone e-reader and Kindles that aren't connected to anything.
