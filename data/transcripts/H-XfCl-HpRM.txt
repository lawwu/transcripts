[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.680]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.880]   For today's podcast,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.840]   we're going to talk about the parts list
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   of the nervous system.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040]   Now, that might sound boring,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.000]   but these are the bits and pieces that together
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   make up everything about your experience of life,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   from what you think about to what you feel,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.600]   what you imagine, and what you accomplish
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.680]   from the day you're born until the day you die.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.320]   That parts list is really incredible
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.740]   because it has a history associated with it
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.360]   that really provides a window into all sorts of things
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.600]   like engineering, warfare, religion, and philosophy.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.940]   So I'm gonna share with you the parts list
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.960]   that makes up who you are
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.840]   through the lens of some of those other aspects of life
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.340]   and other aspects of the history of the discovery
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.080]   of the nervous system.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.520]   By the end of this podcast,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.440]   I promise you're gonna understand a lot more
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.320]   about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.120]   There's gonna be a little bit of story.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   There's gonna be a lot of discussion about the people
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.360]   who made these particular discoveries.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.260]   There'll be a little bit of technical language.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.160]   There's no way to avoid that.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.460]   But at the end, you're gonna have in hand
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.000]   what will be the equivalent of an entire semester
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.020]   of learning about the nervous system and how you work.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.200]   So a few important points before we get started.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.900]   I am not a medical doctor.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.640]   That means I don't prescribe anything.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.920]   I'm a professor.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.700]   So sometimes I'll profess things.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.920]   In fact, I profess a lot of things.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.560]   We are going to talk about some basic functioning
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.800]   of the nervous system, parts, et cetera.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.700]   But we're also gonna talk about how to apply that knowledge.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.600]   That said, your healthcare,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420]   your wellbeing is your responsibility.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.000]   So anytime we talk about tools, please filter it
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.900]   through that responsibility.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.260]   Talk to a healthcare professional
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.980]   if you're gonna explore any new tools or practices.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.220]   And be smart in your pursuit of these new tools.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220]   I also wanna emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.540]   and the other things I do on social media
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.220]   are my personal goal of bringing zero cost
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.120]   to consumer information to the general public.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.560]   It is separate from my role at Stanford University.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.120]   In that spirit, I really wanna thank the sponsors
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.620]   of today's podcast.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.840]   The first one is Athletic Greens,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.340]   which is an all-in-one drink.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160]   It's a greens drink that has vitamins, minerals,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.200]   probiotics, prebiotics.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.260]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.180]   So I'm really delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.540]   The reason I like it is because I like vitamins and minerals.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.500]   I think they're important to my health
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.100]   and it can be kind of overwhelming to know
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.260]   what to take in that landscape.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.660]   So by taking one thing that also happens
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.000]   to taste really good,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900]   I get all the vitamins, minerals, et cetera that I need.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.020]   There's also a lot of data out there now
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.780]   about the importance of the gut microbiome
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.860]   for immune health and for the gut brain access,
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.060]   all these things.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.540]   And the probiotics and prebiotics
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.480]   are important to me for that reason.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.060]   If you wanna try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.700]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.260]   and put in the code word Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.780]   If you do that, they'll send you a year supply
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.060]   of vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.500]   There's a lot in the news lately
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.080]   about the importance of vitamin D3.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.400]   We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.860]   but many of us aren't getting enough sunlight.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.500]   Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.760]   to the immune system and the hormone systems, et cetera.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.300]   So once again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.740]   Enter Huberman at checkout
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.480]   and you get the year supply of D3 and K2
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.700]   along with your Athletic Greens.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.340]   This podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker,
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.820]   which is a health monitoring company.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.540]   It uses blood tests and saliva tests
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.180]   to look at things like DNA and metabolic markers
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.400]   and monitors your hormones,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.060]   a huge number of different parameters of health
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.380]   that really can only be measured accurately
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.500]   through blood and saliva tests.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.340]   I use Inside Tracker because I'm a big believer in data.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.340]   There's a lot of aspects to our biology
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.740]   that can only be accurately measured
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.400]   by way of blood test and saliva test.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.660]   The thing that's really nice about Inside Tracker
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.340]   is that rather than just giving you a bunch of numbers back
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.100]   of the levels of these things in your body,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.000]   it gives you through a really simple platform,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.620]   information about what to do with all those levels
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.460]   of hormones and metabolic markers, et cetera.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.620]   It also has a feature which is particularly interesting,
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.640]   which it measures your inner age,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.260]   which is more a measure of your biological age
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.400]   as opposed to your chronological age.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.520]   And all that information is organized
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.460]   so that you can make changes in your nutritional regimes
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.900]   or your exercise regimes
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   and watch how those markers change over time.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.340]   So if you wanna try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.660]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.980]   and they'll give you 25% off at checkout.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.460]   So let's talk about the nervous system.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.660]   The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.020]   is because your brain is actually just one piece
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.040]   of this larger, more important thing, frankly,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.860]   that we call the nervous system.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.900]   The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord,
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.620]   but also all the connections between your brain
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.500]   and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.180]   It also includes, very importantly,
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.480]   all the connections between your organs
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.520]   back to your spinal cord and brain.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.180]   So the way to think about how you function at every level
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.060]   from the moment you're born until the day you die,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.880]   everything you think and remember and feel and imagine
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.000]   is that your nervous system is this continuous loop
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.280]   of communication between the brain, spinal cord, and body
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.220]   and body, spinal cord, and brain.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.860]   In fact, we really can't even separate them.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.620]   It's one continuous loop.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.180]   You may have heard of something called a Mobius strip.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.780]   A Mobius strip is almost like one of these impossible figures
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.060]   that no matter which angle you look at it from,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.140]   you can't tell where it starts and where it ends.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.460]   And that's really how your nervous system is built.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.100]   That's the structure that allows you to, for instance,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.740]   deploy immune cells, to release cells
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.380]   that will go kill infection
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.860]   when you're in the presence of infection.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.420]   Most people just think about that
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.300]   as a function of the immune system,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.980]   but actually it's your nervous system
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.660]   that tells organs like your spleen to release killer cells
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.740]   that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.620]   and gobble them up.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.500]   If you have a stomach ache, for instance,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.580]   sure, you feel that in your stomach,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.260]   but it's really your nervous system
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.460]   that's causing the stomach ache.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.260]   The ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.380]   So when we want to talk about experience
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.900]   or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.780]   we really need to think about the nervous system first.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.740]   It is fair to say that the nervous system
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.280]   governs all other biological systems of the body,
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.380]   and it's also influenced by those other biological systems.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.860]   So if we're talking about the nervous system,
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.200]   we need to get a little specific about what we mean.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.740]   It's not just this big loop of wires.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.420]   In fact, there's a interesting story about that
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.420]   because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s,
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.340]   it actually was believed that our nervous system
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.520]   was just one giant cell.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.240]   But two guys, the names aren't super important,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.580]   but in fairness to their important discovery,
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.340]   Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.980]   figured out how to label or stain the nervous system
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.200]   in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.900]   we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells,
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.040]   nerve cells, that are called neurons.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.300]   And that's what a neuron is, it's just a nerve cell.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.140]   They also saw that those nerve cells
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.580]   weren't touching one another.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.540]   They're actually separated by little gaps,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.940]   and those little gaps you may have heard of before,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.860]   they're called synapses.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.140]   Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.300]   are kind of spit out or vomited into,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.820]   and then the next nerve cell detects those chemicals
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.380]   and then passes electricity down its length
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.400]   to the next nerve cell and so forth.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.440]   So really the way to think about your body
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.940]   and your thoughts and your mind
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.620]   is that you are a flow of electricity, right?
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.000]   There's nothing mystical about this.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.360]   You're a flow of electricity
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.300]   between these different nerve cells.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.540]   And depending on which nerve cells are active,
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.900]   you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.100]   You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.700]   or you might be seeing something and perceiving
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.780]   that it's green, all depending on which nerve cells
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.680]   are electrically active at a given moment.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.320]   The example of perceiving red or perceiving green
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.260]   is a particularly good example,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.500]   because so often our experience of the world
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.020]   makes it seem as if these things that are happening
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.940]   outside us are actually happening inside us.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.260]   But the language of the nervous system is just electricity.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.680]   It's just like a Morse code of some sort,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.480]   or the syllables and words and consonants
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.500]   and vowels of language.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.980]   It just depends on how they're assembled, what order.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.420]   And so that brings us to the issue
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.900]   of how the nervous system works.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.200]   The way to think about how the nervous system works
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.820]   is that our experiences, our memories,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.500]   everything is sort of like the keys on a piano
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.900]   being played in a particular order, right?
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.500]   If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.960]   and with a particular intensity, that's a given song.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.720]   We can make that analogous to a given experience.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   It's not really that the key A-sharp or E-flat is the song.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.120]   It's just one component of the song.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.960]   So when you hear that, for instance,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.140]   there's a brain area called the hippocampus,
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.000]   which there is, that's involved in memory.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.780]   Well, it's involved in memory,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.740]   but it's not that memories are stored there as sentences.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.040]   They're stored there as patterns of electricity and neurons
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.720]   that when repeated give you the sense
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.920]   that you are experiencing the thing again.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.840]   In fact, deja vu, the sense that what you're experiencing
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.960]   is so familiar and like something
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.880]   that you've experienced previously
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.380]   is merely that the neurons that were active
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.740]   in one circumstance are now becoming active
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.760]   in the same circumstance again.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.580]   And so it's really just like hearing the same song
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.280]   maybe not played on a piano,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.680]   but next time on a classical guitar,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.760]   there's something similar about that song,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.080]   even though it's being played on two different instruments.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.860]   So I think it's important that people understand
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.720]   the parts of their nervous system
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.200]   and that it includes so much more than just the brain
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.980]   and that there are these things, neurons and synapses,
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.640]   but really that it's the electrical activity of these neurons
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.080]   that dictates our experience.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.360]   So if the early 1900s
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   were when these neurons were discovered,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.440]   certainly a lot has happened since then.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.760]   And in that time between the early 1900s and now,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.840]   there's some important events that actually happened
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.040]   in history that give us insight or gave us insight
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.880]   into how the nervous system works.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.580]   One of the more surprising ones was actually warfare.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.120]   So as most everybody knows in warfare,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   people get shot and people often die,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.700]   but many people get shot and they don't die.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.520]   And in World War I, there were some changes
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   in artillery in bullets that made for a situation
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.640]   where bullets would enter the body and brain
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.300]   at very discreet locations
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.960]   and would go out the other side of the body or brain
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.280]   and also make a very small hole at that exit location.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.360]   And in doing so produced a lot of naturally occurring
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.200]   lesions of the nervous system.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.020]   Now you say, okay, well, how does that relate to neuroscience?
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.020]   Well, unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.560]   would create these big sort of holes
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.480]   as the bullets would blow out of the brain or body,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.320]   I know this is rather gruesome,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.560]   when the holes were very discreet,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.120]   they entered at one point and left at another point,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.880]   they would take out or destroy very discreet bits
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.420]   of neural tissue of the nervous system.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.800]   So people were coming back from war with holes
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.500]   in their brain and in other parts of their nervous system
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.200]   that were limited to very specific locations.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.960]   In addition to that, there was some advancement
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.200]   in the cleaning of wounds that happened,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.340]   so many more people were surviving.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.220]   What this meant was that neurologists
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.440]   now had a collection of patients that would come back
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.760]   and they'd have holes in very specific locations
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.000]   of their brain and they'd say things like,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.180]   well, I can recognize faces,
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.640]   but I can't recognize who those faces belong to.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.440]   I know it's a face, but I don't know who it belongs to.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.840]   And after that person eventually died,
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.040]   the neurologist would figure out,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.660]   ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.080]   that they couldn't recognize faces
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.440]   and they all had these bullet holes
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.360]   that went through a particular region of the brain.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.640]   And that's how we know a lot about
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.820]   how particular brain regions like the hippocampus work.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.000]   In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.520]   where people would come back and they, for instance,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.120]   would speak in complete gibberish,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.680]   whereas previously they could speak normally.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.520]   And even though they were speaking in complete gibberish,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.280]   they could understand language perfectly.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.920]   That's how we know that speech and language
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.160]   are actually controlled by separate portions
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.200]   of the nervous system.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.120]   And there are many examples like that,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   people that couldn't recognize the faces of famous people.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.520]   Or, and that actually brings us
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.720]   to an interesting example in modern times.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.160]   Many, many years later in the early 2000s,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.440]   there was actually a paper
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.000]   that was published in the journal "Nature,"
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.780]   excellent journal, showing that in a human being,
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.600]   a perfectly healthy human being,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.760]   there was a neuron that would become active,
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.600]   electrically active, only when the person viewed
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.120]   the picture of Jennifer Aniston, the actress.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.080]   So literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.560]   so-called Jennifer Aniston cells.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.840]   Neuroscientists know about these Jennifer Aniston cells.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.960]   If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face,
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.800]   you have Jennifer Aniston neurons.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.120]   And presumably you also have neurons
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.800]   that can recognize the faces of other famous
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.440]   and non-famous people.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   So that indicates that our brain is really a map
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.240]   of our experience.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.040]   We come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.920]   towards learning particular kinds of things.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.840]   It's ready to receive information
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.400]   and learn that information,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.620]   but the brain is really a map of experience.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.600]   So let's talk about what experience really is.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.400]   What does it mean for your brain to work?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   Well, I think it's fair to say
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.280]   that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.320]   The first one is sensation.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.520]   So this is important to understand for any and all of you
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   that want to change your nervous system
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.160]   Sensation is a non-negotiable element
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.380]   of your nervous system.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.800]   You have neurons in your eye
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.300]   that perceive certain colors of light
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.080]   and certain directions of movement.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.040]   You have neurons in your skin
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.580]   that perceive particular kinds of touch,
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.920]   like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.000]   You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.720]   Your entire experience of life is filtered
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.480]   by these what we call sensory receptors,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.760]   if you want to know what the name is.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.720]   So this always raises an interesting question.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.380]   People ask, well, is there much more out there?
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.560]   Is there a lot more happening in the world
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   that I'm not experiencing or that humans aren't experiencing?
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.440]   And the answer of course is yes.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.200]   There are many species on this planet
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.100]   that are perceiving things that we will never perceive
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.480]   unless we apply technology.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.160]   The best example I could think of off the top of my head
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.540]   would be something like infrared vision.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.720]   There are snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.080]   that can sense heat emissions from other animals.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.680]   They don't actually see their shape.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.400]   They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.260]   Humans can't do that unless of course
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.480]   they put on infrared goggles or something
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.360]   that would allow them to detect those heat emissions.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.520]   There are turtles and certain species of birds
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.200]   that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.940]   because they have neurons.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.520]   Again, it's the nervous system that allows them to do this.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.320]   So they have neurons in their nose and in their head
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.520]   that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.980]   in order to, as amazing as this sounds,
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.120]   go from one particular location in the ocean,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.280]   thousands of miles away to all aggregate
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   on one particular beach at a particular time of year
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.220]   so that they can mate, lay eggs
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.800]   and then wander back off into the sea to die
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.840]   and then their young will eventually hatch.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.800]   Those cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.400]   swim off and go do the exact same thing.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.780]   They don't migrate that distance by vision.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.840]   They don't do it by smell.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.180]   They do it by sensing magnetic fields, okay?
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.900]   And many other species do these incredible things.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.500]   Humans are not magnetic sensing organisms.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.860]   We can't do that because we don't have receptors
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.620]   that sense magnetic fields.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.160]   There are some data that maybe some humans
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.860]   can sense magnetic fields,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.460]   but you should be very skeptical of anyone
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.140]   that's convinced that they can do that
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.260]   with any degree of robustness or accuracy
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.560]   because even the people that can do this
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.940]   aren't necessarily aware that they can.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.260]   Maybe a topic for a future podcast.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.700]   So we have sensation.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.980]   Then we have perception.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.180]   Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.340]   and focus on it and make sense of it,
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.960]   to explore it, to remember it.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.580]   So really perceptions are just whichever sensations
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.220]   we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.680]   And you can do this right now.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.540]   You can experience perception
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.060]   and the difference between perception
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.260]   and sensation very easily.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.500]   If for instance, I tell you to pay attention
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.360]   to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.900]   with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with,
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.620]   maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.160]   If your feet are up, maybe it's air.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.060]   The moment you place your,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.820]   what we call the spotlight of attention
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.140]   or the spotlight of perception on your feet,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.840]   you are now perceiving what was happening there,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.100]   what was being sensed there.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.820]   The sensation was happening all along, however.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.740]   So while sensation is not negotiable,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.280]   you can't change your receptors
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.740]   unless you adopt some new technology.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.180]   Perception is under the control of your attention.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.700]   And the way to think about attention
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.060]   is it's like a spotlight, except it's not one spotlight.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.680]   You actually have two attentional spotlights.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.020]   Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.420]   tell them they're wrong.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.440]   And if they disagree with you, tell them to contact me.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   Because in old world primates of which humans are,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.700]   we are able to do what's called covert attention.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.340]   We can place a spotlight of attention on something.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.780]   For instance, something we're reading or looking at,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.080]   or someone that we're listening to.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.180]   And we can place a second spotlight of attention
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.380]   on something we're eating and how it tastes,
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.660]   or our child running around in the room, or my dog.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.980]   You can split your attention into two locations,
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.920]   but of course you can also bring your attention,
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.420]   that is your perception, to one particular location.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.880]   You can dilate your attention,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.060]   kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.100]   or you can make it more concentrated.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.900]   This is very important to understand
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.860]   if you're going to think about tools
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.800]   to improve your nervous system.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.220]   Whether or not that tool is in the form of a chemical
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.260]   that you decide to take,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.820]   maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain,
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.160]   if that's your choice, or a brain machine device,
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.640]   or you're going to try and learn something better
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.100]   by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.200]   for some period of time each day.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.340]   Attention is something that is absolutely under your control,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.780]   in particular, when you're rested.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.860]   And we'll get back to this, but when you are rested,
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.500]   and we'll define rest very clearly,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.640]   you are able to direct your attention
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.060]   in very deliberate ways.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.980]   And that's because we have something in our nervous system
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.340]   which is sort of like a two-way street.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.460]   And that two-way street is a communication
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.260]   between the aspects of our nervous system
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.140]   that are reflexive and the aspects of our nervous system
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.480]   that are deliberate.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.140]   So we all know what it's like to be reflexive.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.860]   You go through life, you're walking.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.100]   If you already know how to walk,
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.900]   you don't think about your walking, you just walk.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.640]   And that's because the nervous system wants to pass off
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.760]   as much as it can to reflexive action.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.580]   That's called a bottom-up processing.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.420]   It really just means that information is flowing in
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.640]   through your senses, regardless of what you're perceiving,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.940]   that information is flowing up
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.280]   and it's directing your activity.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   But at any moment, for instance,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.340]   let's say a car screeches in front of you around the corner
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.980]   and you suddenly pause, you are now moving
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.440]   into deliberate action.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.740]   You would start looking around in a very deliberate way.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.540]   The nervous system can be reflexive in its action
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.240]   or it can be deliberate.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.920]   If reflexive action tends to be what we call bottom-up,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.180]   deliberate action and deliberate perceptions
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.600]   and deliberate thoughts are top-down.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.980]   They require some effort and some focus,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.900]   but that's the point.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.580]   You can decide to focus your attention and energy
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.860]   on anything you want.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.540]   You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want,
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.580]   but it will always feel like it requires some effort
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.460]   and some strain.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.800]   Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.720]   just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.300]   it's gonna feel very easy.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.820]   And that's because your nervous system basically wired up
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.900]   to be able to do most things easily
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.500]   without much metabolic demand,
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.060]   without consuming much energy.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.360]   But the moment you try and do something very specific,
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.860]   you're gonna feel a sort of mental friction.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.460]   It's gonna be challenging.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.980]   So we've got sensations, perceptions,
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.780]   and then we've got things that we call feelings/emotions.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.440]   And these get a little complicated
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.840]   because almost all of us, I would hope all of us,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.020]   are familiar with things like happiness and sadness
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.820]   or boredom or frustration.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.840]   Scientists argue like crazy,
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.300]   neuroscientists and psychologists
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.740]   and philosophers for that matter,
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.700]   argue like crazy about what these are and how they work.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.740]   Certainly emotions and feelings
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.020]   are the product of the nervous system.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.560]   They involve the activity of neurons.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.500]   But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.660]   but they also release chemicals.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.860]   And there's a certain category of chemicals
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.140]   that has a very profound influence on our emotional states.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.420]   They're called neuromodulators.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.040]   And those neuromodulators have names
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.660]   that probably you've heard of before,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.880]   things like dopamine and serotonin
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.900]   and acetylcholine, epinephrine.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.340]   Neuromodulators are really interesting
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.740]   because they bias which neurons are likely to be active
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.660]   and which ones are likely to be inactive.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.700]   A simple way to think about neuromodulators
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.940]   is they are sort of like playlists
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.700]   that you would have on any kind of device
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.180]   where you're gonna play particular categories of music.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.020]   So for instance, dopamine, which is often discussed
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020]   as the molecule of reward or joy, is involved in reward.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.020]   And it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.420]   when released in appropriate amounts in the brain.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.940]   But the reason it does that
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.120]   is because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.900]   as we call them, more active and others less active.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.060]   So serotonin, for instance, is a molecule
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.220]   that when released tends to make us feel really good
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.940]   with what we have, our sort of internal landscape
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.620]   and the resources that we have.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.340]   Whereas dopamine, more than being a molecule of reward,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.320]   is really more a molecule of motivation
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.760]   toward things that are outside us and that we want to pursue.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.480]   And we can look at healthy conditions or situations
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.400]   like being in pursuit of a goal
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.240]   where every time we accomplish something
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.660]   in route to that goal, a little bit of dopamine is released
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.600]   and we feel more motivation, that happens.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.740]   We can also look at the extreme example
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.100]   of something like mania, where somebody is so, you know,
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.240]   relentlessly in pursuit of external things like money
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.580]   and relationships that they're sort of
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.340]   in this delusional state of thinking
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.180]   that they have the resources that they need
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.320]   in order to pursue all these things
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.620]   when in fact they don't.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.420]   So these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels,
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.700]   low levels, high levels.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.480]   And that actually gives us a window
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.980]   into a very important aspect of neuroscience history
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.860]   that all of us are impacted by today,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.140]   which is the discovery of antidepressants
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.100]   and so-called antipsychotics.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.580]   In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.420]   it was discovered that there are compounds, chemicals,
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.080]   that can increase or decrease serotonin,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.820]   that can increase or decrease dopamine.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.980]   And that led to the development
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.960]   of most of what we call antidepressants.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.000]   Now, the trick here or the problem
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.320]   is that most of these drugs,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.680]   especially in the 1950s and '60s,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.020]   they would reduce serotonin,
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.720]   but they would also reduce dopamine,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.060]   or they would increase serotonin,
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.440]   but they would also increase
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.280]   some other neuromodulator or chemical.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.300]   And that's because all these chemical systems in the body,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.460]   but the neuromodulators in particular,
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.360]   have a lot of receptors.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.780]   Now, these are different than the receptors
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.980]   we were talking about earlier.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.360]   The receptors I'm talking about now
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.700]   are sort of like parking spots where dopamine is released.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.940]   And if it attaches to a receptor, say, on the heart,
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.140]   it might make the heart beat faster
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.580]   because there's a certain kind of receptor on the heart.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.280]   Whereas if dopamine is released
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.460]   and goes and attaches to muscle,
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.640]   it might have a completely different effect on muscle.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.480]   And in fact, it does.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.140]   So different receptors on different organs of the body
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.420]   are the ways that these neuromodulators
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.740]   can have all these different effects
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.860]   on different aspects of our biology.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.860]   This is most salient in the example
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.160]   of some of the antidepressants
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.580]   that have sexual side effects,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.740]   or that blunt appetite, or that blunt motivation.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.280]   Many of these which increase serotonin
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.320]   can be very beneficial for people.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.760]   It can elevate their mood, it can make them feel better,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.020]   but they also, if the doses are too high,
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.600]   or if that particular drug isn't right for somebody,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.360]   that person experiences challenges with motivation,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.800]   or appetite, or libido,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   because serotonin is binding to receptors
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.680]   in the areas of the brain
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.180]   that control those other things as well.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.420]   So we talked about sensation, we talked about perception.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.480]   When we talk about feelings,
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.000]   we have to consider these neuromodulators.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.100]   And we have to consider also that feelings and emotions
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.720]   are contextual.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.520]   In some cultures, showing a lot of joy or a lot of sadness
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.860]   is entirely appropriate.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.440]   In other cultures, it's considered inappropriate.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.820]   So I don't think it's fair to say
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.180]   that there's a sadness circuit or area of the brain,
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.520]   or a happiness circuit or area of the brain.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.420]   However, it is fair to say that certain chemicals
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.020]   and certain brain circuits tend to be active
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.640]   when we are in motivated states,
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.340]   tend to be active when we are in non-motivated, lazy states,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.600]   tend to be active when we are focused,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.060]   and tend to be active when we are not focused.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.240]   I want to emphasize also that emotions
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.980]   are something that we generally feel
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.220]   are not under our control.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.100]   We feel like they kind of geyser up within us
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.180]   and they just kind of happen to us.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.880]   And that's because they are somewhat reflexive.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.440]   We don't really set out with a deliberate thought
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.780]   to be happy or deliberate thought to be sad.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.120]   We tend to experience them
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.840]   in kind of a passive reflexive way.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.800]   And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.020]   Thoughts are really interesting
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.740]   because in many ways they're like perceptions,
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.100]   except that they draw
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.440]   on not just what's happening in the present,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.280]   but also things we remember from the past
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.080]   and things that we anticipate about the future.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.020]   The other thing about thoughts that's really interesting
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.760]   is that thoughts can be both reflexive,
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.660]   they can just be occurring all the time,
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.380]   sort of like pop-up windows
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.920]   on a poorly filtered web browser,
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.440]   or they can be deliberate.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.020]   We can decide to have a thought.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.080]   In fact, right now you could decide to have a thought
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.920]   just like you would decide to write something out
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.280]   on a piece of paper.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.640]   You could decide that you're listening to a podcast,
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.840]   that you are in a particular location.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.500]   You're not just paying attention to what's happening,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.780]   you're directing your thought process.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.520]   And a lot of people don't understand,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.740]   or at least appreciate that the thought patterns
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.560]   and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.680]   can actually be controlled in this deliberate way.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.320]   And then finally, there are actions.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.140]   Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.560]   to our nervous system.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.260]   Because first of all,
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.580]   our behaviors are actually the only thing
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.720]   that are gonna create any fossil record of our existence.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.120]   After we die, the nervous system deteriorates,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.800]   our skeleton will remain,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.120]   but it's in the moment of experiencing
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.520]   something very joyful or something very sad,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.500]   it can feel so all encompassing
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.920]   that we actually think that it has some meaning
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.160]   beyond that moment.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   But actually for humans, and I think for all species,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.480]   the sensations, the perceptions and the thoughts
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.760]   and the feelings that we have in our lifespan,
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.700]   none of that is actually carried forward
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.860]   except the ones that we take
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.920]   and we convert into actions such as writing,
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.440]   actions such as words,
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.680]   actions such as engineering new things.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.540]   And so the fossil record of our species
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.040]   and of each one of us is really through action.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.320]   And that in part is why so much of our nervous system
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.840]   is devoted to converting sensation, perceptions,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.660]   feelings and thoughts into actions.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.540]   In fact, the great neuroscientist or physiologist,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.320]   Sherrington, won a Nobel Prize for his work
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.960]   in mapping some of the circuitry,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.480]   the connections between nerve cells
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.420]   that give rise to movement.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.160]   And he said, "Movement is the final common pathway."
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.620]   The other way to think about it
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.840]   is that one of the reasons that our central nervous system,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.920]   our brain and spinal cord include this stuff in our skull,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   but also connects so heavily to the body
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.800]   is because most everything that we experience,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.600]   including our thoughts and feelings,
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.920]   was really designed to either impact our behavior or not.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.760]   And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.960]   and anticipate the future
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.700]   and not just experience what's happening in the moment,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.100]   gave rise to an incredible capacity
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   for us to engage in behaviors
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.820]   that are not just for the moment,
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.920]   they're based on things that we know from the past
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.960]   and that we would like to see in the future.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.800]   And this aspect to our nervous system of creating movement
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.480]   occurs through some very simple pathways.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.720]   The reflexive pathway basically includes
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.000]   areas of the brainstem we call central pattern generators.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.040]   When you walk, provided you already know how to walk,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.100]   you are basically walking
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.000]   because you have these central pattern generators,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.140]   groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.040]   right foot, left foot kind of movement.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.600]   However, when you decide to move
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.160]   in a particular deliberate way
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.240]   that requires a little more attention,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.520]   you start to engage areas of your brain
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   for top-down processing,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.620]   where your forebrain works from the top down
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.600]   to control those central pattern generators
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.820]   so that maybe it's right foot, right foot, left foot,
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.960]   right foot, right foot, left foot
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.120]   if maybe you're hiking along some rocks or something
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.560]   and you have to engage in that kind of movement.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.000]   So movement is just like thoughts,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.440]   can be either reflexive or deliberate.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.000]   And when we talk about deliberate,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.020]   I wanna be very specific about how your brain works
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.860]   in the deliberate way
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.440]   because it gives rise to a very important feature
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.240]   of the nervous system that we're gonna talk about next,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   which is your ability to change your nervous system.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.180]   And what I'd like to center on for a second
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.060]   is this notion of what does it mean
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.060]   for the nervous system to do something deliberately?
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.480]   Well, when you do something deliberately,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.680]   you pay attention, you are bringing your perception
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.460]   to an analysis of three things.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.680]   Duration, how long something is gonna take
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.160]   or should be done.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.240]   Path, what you should be doing.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.260]   And outcome, if you do something
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.600]   for a given length of time, what's gonna happen.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.880]   Now, when you're walking down the street
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.200]   or you're eating or you're just talking reflexively,
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.220]   you're not doing this, what I call DPO,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.400]   duration path outcome type of deliberate function
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.300]   in your brain and nervous system.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.080]   But the moment you decide to learn something
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.280]   or to resist speaking or to speak up
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.400]   when you would rather be quiet,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.240]   anytime you're deliberately forcing yourself
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   over a threshold, you're engaging these brain circuits
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.360]   and these nervous system circuits
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.120]   that suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.620]   something has changed.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.720]   Well, what's changed?
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.000]   What's changed is that when you engage in this duration path
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and outcome type of thinking or behavior or way of being,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.020]   you start to recruit these neuromodulators
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.320]   that are released from particular areas of your brain
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.920]   and also it turns out from your body
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.240]   and they start queuing to your nervous system,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.080]   something's different.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.280]   Something's different now about what I'm doing.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.680]   Something's different about what I'm feeling.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.160]   Let's give an example where perhaps somebody says something
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   that's triggering to you.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.340]   You don't like it and you know you shouldn't respond.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.000]   You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.400]   I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.840]   You're actively suppressing your behavior
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.640]   through top-down processing.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.600]   Your forebrain is actually preventing you
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.340]   from saying the thing that you know you shouldn't say
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.760]   or that maybe you should wait to say
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.560]   or say in a different form.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.760]   This feels like agitation and stress
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.120]   because you're actually suppressing a circuit.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.420]   We actually can see examples of what happens
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.100]   when you're not doing this well.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.960]   Some of the examples come from children.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.440]   If you look at young children,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.900]   they don't have the forebrain circuitry
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.880]   to engage in this top-down processing
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.320]   until they reach age 22, even 25.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.920]   But in young children, you see this in a really robust way.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.720]   You'll see they'll be rocking back and forth.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's hard for them to sit still
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.960]   because those central pattern generators
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.400]   are constantly going in the background
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   whereas adults can sit still.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.600]   A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.660]   and will just reach out and grab it
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.580]   whereas an adult probably would ask
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.420]   if they could have a piece
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.560]   or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.980]   People that have damage to the certain areas
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.120]   of the frontal lobes don't have this kind of restriction.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.580]   They'll just blurt things out.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.480]   They'll just say things.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.960]   We all know people like this.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.960]   Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control,
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.120]   a lack of top-down processing.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.160]   The other thing that will turn off the forebrain
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.280]   and make it harder to top-down processing
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.560]   is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.200]   The removal of inhibition is actually
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.600]   a removal of neural inhibition of nerve cells
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.440]   suppressing the activity of other nerve cells.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.320]   And so when you look at people
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.120]   that have damage to their frontal lobes
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.080]   or you look at puppies or you look at young children,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.440]   everything's a stimulus.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.420]   Everything is a potential interaction for them
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.880]   and they have a very hard time
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.520]   restricting their behavior and their speech.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.920]   So a lot of the motor system
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.800]   is designed to just work in a reflexive way.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.760]   And then when we decide we want to learn something
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.180]   or do something or not do something,
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.680]   we have to engage in this top-down restriction
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.280]   and it feels like agitation
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.160]   because it's accompanied by the release
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   which in the body we call adrenaline
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.320]   and it actually makes us feel agitated.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.980]   So for those of you that are trying to learn something new
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.120]   or to learn to suppress your responses
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.100]   or be more deliberate and careful in your responses,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.480]   that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.540]   It's going to feel challenging
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.140]   because the chemicals in your body
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.420]   that are released in association with that effort
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.640]   are designed to make you feel kind of agitated.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.620]   That low-level tremor that sometimes people feel
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.060]   when they're really, really angry
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.400]   is actually a chemically induced low-level tremor.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.920]   And it's the, what I call limbic friction.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.380]   There's an area of your brain that's involved
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.560]   in our more primitive reflexive responses
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.960]   called the limbic system.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.760]   And the frontal cortex is in a friction.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.000]   It's in a tug of war with that system all the time,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.260]   unless of course you have damage to the frontal lobe
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.780]   or you've had too much to drink or something,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.320]   in which case you tend to just say and do whatever.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.460]   And so this is really important to understand
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.720]   because if you want to understand neuroplasticity,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.740]   you want to understand how to shape your behavior,
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.840]   how to shape your thinking,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.700]   how to change how you're able to perform in any context.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.600]   The most important thing to understand
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.760]   is that it requires top-down processing.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.760]   It requires this feeling of agitation.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.260]   In fact, I would say that agitation and strain
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.240]   is the entry point to neuroplasticity.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.920]   So let's take a look at what neuroplasticity is.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.020]   Let's explore it not as the way it's normally talked about
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.720]   in modern culture as a neuroplasticity.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.960]   Plasticity is great.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.000]   What exactly do people mean?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.040]   Plasticity itself is just a process
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.680]   by which neurons can change their connections
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.720]   in the way they work so that you can go from things
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.480]   being very challenging and deliberate,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   requiring a lot of effort and strain
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.020]   to them being reflexive.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.800]   And typically, when we hear about plasticity,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.920]   we're thinking about positive
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.360]   or what I call adaptive plasticity.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.340]   A lot of plasticity can be induced, for instance,
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.280]   by brain damage, but that's generally
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.160]   not the kind of plasticity that we want.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.840]   So when I say plasticity, unless I say otherwise,
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.680]   I mean adaptive plasticity.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   And in particular, most of the neuroplasticity
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.600]   that people want is self-directed plasticity
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.440]   because if there's one truism to neuroplasticity,
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.680]   it's that from birth until about age 25,
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.640]   the brain is incredibly plastic.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.660]   Kids are learning all sorts of things,
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.380]   but they can learn it passively.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.800]   They don't have to work too hard or focus too hard,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.720]   although focus helps, to learn new things,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.120]   acquire new languages, acquire new skills.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.000]   But if you're an adult and you want to change
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.520]   your neural circuitry at the level of emotions
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.340]   or behavior or thoughts or anything really,
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.400]   you absolutely need to ask two important questions.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   One, what particular aspect of my nervous system
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.380]   am I trying to change?
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.440]   Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.480]   or my perceptions, my sensations,
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.840]   and which ones are available for me to change?
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.620]   And then the second question is,
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.260]   how are you going to go about that?
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.680]   What is the structure of a regimen
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.360]   to engage neuroplasticity?
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.380]   And it turns out that the answer to that second question
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.080]   is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.600]   So let's talk about that next.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.500]   Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.560]   in the brain and body to change in response to experience.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.080]   And what's so incredible about the human nervous system
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.100]   in particular is that we can direct our own neural changes.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.440]   We can decide that we want to change our brain.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.520]   In other words, our brain can change itself
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.400]   and our nervous system can change itself.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.280]   And the same can't be said for other organs of the body.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.480]   Even though our other organs of the body have some ability
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.020]   to change, they can't direct it.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.960]   They can't think and decide, oh, you know,
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.240]   your gut doesn't say, oh, you know,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.500]   I want to be able to digest spicy foods better.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.480]   So I'm going to rearrange the connections
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.360]   to be able to do that.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.120]   Whereas your brain can decide
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.660]   that you want to learn a language
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.040]   or you want to be less emotionally reactive
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.740]   or more emotionally engaged.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.040]   And you can undergo a series of steps
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.020]   that will allow your brain to make those changes
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.180]   so that eventually it becomes reflexive for you to do that,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.060]   which is absolutely incredible.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.300]   For a long time, it was thought that neuroplasticity
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.380]   was the unique gift of young animals and humans,
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.140]   that it could only occur when we're young.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.120]   And in fact, the young brain is incredibly plastic.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.920]   Children can learn three languages
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.120]   without an accent reflexively,
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.760]   whereas adults, it's very challenging.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.440]   It takes a lot more effort and strain,
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   a lot more of that duration path outcome kind of thinking
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.720]   in order to achieve those plastic changes.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.360]   We now know, however, that the adult brain can change
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.200]   in response to experience.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.820]   Nobel prizes were given for the understanding
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.360]   that the young brain can change very dramatically.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.020]   I think one of the most extreme examples would be
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.980]   for people that are born blind from birth,
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.460]   they use the area of their brain
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.640]   that normally would be used for visualizing objects
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.180]   and colors and things outside of them for braille reading.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.200]   In brain imaging studies, it's been shown that, you know,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.400]   people who are blind from birth, when they braille read,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.760]   the area of the brain that would normally light up,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.960]   if you will, for vision, lights up for braille reading.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.560]   So that real estate is reallocated
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.320]   for an entirely different function.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:49.560]   If someone is made blind in adulthood,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.080]   it's unlikely that their entire visual brain
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.500]   will be taken over by the areas of the brain
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.840]   they're responsible for touch.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.180]   However, there's some evidence that areas of the brain
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.580]   that are involved in hearing and touch
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.120]   can kind of migrate into that area.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.500]   And there's a lot of interest now in trying to figure out
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.080]   how more plasticity can be induced in adulthood,
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.380]   more positive plasticity.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.640]   And in order to understand that process,
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.980]   we really have to understand something that might
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.880]   at first seem totally divorced from neuroplasticity,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.920]   but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.420]   And for any of you that are interested
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.020]   in changing your nervous system,
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.440]   so that something that you want can go
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.360]   from being very hard or seem almost impossible
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.900]   and out of reach to being very reflexive,
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.660]   this is especially important to pay attention to.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:43.400]   Plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gated,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.640]   meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.600]   These things that we talked about earlier,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.000]   dopamine, serotonin, and one in particular
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.920]   called acetylcholine, are what open up plasticity.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.200]   They literally unveil plasticity
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.640]   and allow brief periods of time
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.700]   in which whatever information,
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.180]   whatever thing we're sensing or perceiving or thinking,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.020]   whatever emotions we feel,
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.260]   can literally be mapped in the brain
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.240]   such that later it will become much easier
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.920]   for us to experience and feel that thing.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   Now this has a dark side and a positive side.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.240]   The dark side is it's actually very easy
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.520]   to get neuroplasticity as an adult
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.400]   through traumatic or terrible or challenging experiences.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.720]   But the important question is to say, why is that?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.660]   And the reason that's the case
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.260]   is because when something very bad happens,
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.240]   there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.720]   in the brain, epinephrine,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.260]   which tends to make us feel alert and agitated,
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.200]   which is associated with most bad circumstances,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.800]   and acetylcholine, which tends to create
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.060]   a even more intense and focused perceptual spotlight.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.160]   Remember earlier we were talking about perception
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.840]   and how it's kind of like a spotlight.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.480]   Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.080]   and particularly restricted to one region of our experience.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.600]   And it does that by making certain neurons
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   in our brain and body active much more than all the rest.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:18.200]   So acetylcholine is sort of like a highlighter marker
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.800]   upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.820]   and says, wait, which neurons were active
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.760]   in this particularly alerting phase of whatever,
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.800]   day or night, whenever this thing happened to happen.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.920]   So the way it works is this.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.320]   You can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.980]   and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.680]   compared to what you were experiencing before.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.880]   And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.900]   that highlights whatever happens during that period
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.440]   of heightened alertness.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.760]   So just to be clear, it's epinephrine creates the alertness
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.840]   that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brainstem
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.080]   if you're interested, and acetylcholine coming from an area
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.600]   of the forebrain is tagging or marking the neurons
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.520]   that are particularly active during this heightened level
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.420]   of alertness.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:13.160]   Now that marks the cells, the neurons and the synapses
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.680]   for strengthening, for becoming more likely to be active
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.760]   in the future, even without us thinking about it, okay?
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.480]   So in bad circumstances, this all happens
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.600]   without us having to do much.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.040]   When we want something to happen, however,
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.540]   we wanna learn a new language.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.180]   We want to learn a new skill.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.360]   We wanna become more motivated.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.520]   What do we know for certain?
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.320]   We know that that process of getting neuroplasticity
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.480]   so that we have more focus, more motivation,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.740]   absolutely requires the release of epinephrine.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.100]   We have to have alertness in order to have focus,
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.280]   and we have to have focus in order to direct
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.000]   those plastic changes to particular parts
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.680]   of our nervous system.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.200]   Now this has immense implications in thinking
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.720]   about the various tools, whether or not those
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.240]   are chemical tools or machine tools or just self-induced
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.800]   regimens of how long or how intensely you're going to focus
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.840]   in order to get neuroplasticity.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.160]   But there's another side to it.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.280]   The dirty secret of neuroplasticity is that
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.680]   no neuroplasticity occurs during the thing
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.300]   you're trying to learn, during the terrible event,
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.440]   during the great event, during the thing
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.480]   that you're really trying to shape and learn.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.680]   Nothing is actually changing between the neurons
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.160]   that is going to last.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.600]   All the neuroplasticity, the strengthening of the synapses,
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.640]   the addition in some cases of new nerve cells,
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.440]   or at least connections between nerve cells,
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.900]   all of that occurs at a very different phase of life,
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.840]   which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.960]   And so neuroplasticity, which is the kind of holy grail
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.460]   of human experience of, you know, this is the new year
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.280]   and everyone's thinking new year's resolutions.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.920]   And right now, perhaps everything's organized
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.400]   and people are highly motivated,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.160]   but what happens in March or April or May?
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.460]   Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.880]   one can continually bring to whatever it is
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.080]   they're trying to learn.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.320]   So much so that agitation and a feeling of strain
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.400]   are actually required for this process of neuroplasticity
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.240]   to get triggered, but the actual rewiring occurs
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.640]   during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.020]   There's a study published last year
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.280]   that's particularly relevant here that I want to share
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.320]   was not done by my laboratory,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.280]   that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.920]   this is not deep sleep,
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.840]   but essentially doing something very hard and very intense
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.160]   and then taking 20 minutes afterwards,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.300]   immediately afterwards, to deliberately turn off
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.680]   the deliberate focused thinking and engagement
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.460]   actually accelerated neuroplasticity.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.680]   There's another study that's just incredible,
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.040]   and we're going to go into this in a future episode
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.160]   of the podcast, not too long from now,
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   that showed that if people are learning a particular skill,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.800]   it could be a language skill or a motor skill,
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.480]   and they hear a tone just playing in the background,
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.520]   the tone is playing periodically through the background,
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   like just a bell, in deep sleep, if that bell is played,
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.700]   learning is much faster for the thing
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.200]   that they were learning while they were awake.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.800]   It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.560]   doesn't even have to be in dreaming,
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.000]   that something that happened in the waking phase
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.500]   was especially important,
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.600]   so much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.320]   it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.600]   oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.680]   at that particular time of day,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.840]   and the learning rates and the rates of retention,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.220]   meaning how much people can remember
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.400]   from the thing they learned,
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.820]   are significantly higher under those conditions.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.520]   So I'm going to talk about how to apply all this knowledge
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.100]   in a little bit more in this podcast episode,
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.920]   but also in future episodes.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.160]   But it really speaks to the really key importance
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.600]   of sleep and focus,
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.760]   these two opposite ends of our attentional state.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   When we're in sleep, these DPOs,
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.400]   duration, path, and outcome analysis, are impossible.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.800]   We just can't do that.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.420]   We are only in relation to what's happening inside of us.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.380]   So sleep is key.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.080]   Also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.960]   where we're turning off our analysis
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.580]   of duration, path, and outcome,
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.160]   in particular for the thing
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.240]   that we were just trying to learn.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   And we're in this kind of liminal state
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.480]   where our attention is kind of drifting all over.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.120]   It turns out that's very important for the consolidation,
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.360]   for the changes between the nerve cells
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.560]   that will allow what we were trying to learn
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.120]   to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.280]   and a strain to easy and reflexive.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.240]   This also points to how different people,
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.120]   including many modern clinicians,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.840]   are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances,
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.680]   traumas, from routing their way
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.280]   into our nervous system permanently.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.540]   It says that you might want to interfere
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.180]   with certain aspects of brain states
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.540]   that are away from the bad thing that happened,
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.560]   the brain states that happened the next day
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.800]   or the next month or the next year.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.920]   And also I want to make sure that I pay attention
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.220]   to the fact that for many of you,
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.600]   you're thinking about neuroplasticity,
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.880]   not just in changing your nervous system
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.920]   to add something new, but to also get rid of things
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.880]   that you don't like, right?
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.080]   That you want to forget bad experiences
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.500]   or at least remove the emotional contingency
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.320]   of a bad relationship or a bad relationship
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.940]   to something or some person or some event.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.340]   Learning to fear certain things less,
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.760]   to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.980]   The memories themselves don't get erased.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.760]   I'm sorry to say that the memories themselves get erased,
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.600]   but the emotional load of memories can be reduced.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.920]   And there are a number of different ways
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.640]   that that can happen, but they all require this thing
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.520]   that we're calling neuroplasticity.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.920]   We're going to have a large number of discussions
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.020]   about neuroplasticity in depth.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.440]   But the most important thing to understand
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.420]   is that it is indeed a two-phase process.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:21.240]   What governs the transition between alert and focused
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.800]   and these deep rest and deep sleep states
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.240]   is a system in our brain and body,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.860]   a certain aspect of the nervous system
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.580]   called the autonomic nervous system.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.800]   And it is immensely important to understand
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.260]   how this autonomic nervous system works.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.400]   It has names like the sympathetic nervous system
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.720]   and parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.400]   which frankly are complicated names
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.760]   because they're a little bit misleading.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.580]   Sympathetic is the one that's associated
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.420]   with more alertness.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.080]   Parasympathetic is the one that's associated
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.760]   with more calmness.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.100]   And it gets really misleading
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.340]   because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.860]   and then people think it's related to calm.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.420]   I'm going to call it the alertness system
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.200]   and the calmness system
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.700]   because even though sympathetic and parasympathetic
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.380]   are sometimes used, people really get confused.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.700]   So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.940]   and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.900]   but in particular for neuroplasticity
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.960]   and engaging in these focused states
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.620]   and then these defocused states
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.860]   is that it works sort of like a seesaw.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.000]   Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.180]   that when we wake up in the morning,
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.300]   we might be a little bit groggy,
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.980]   but then generally we're more alert.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.140]   And then as evening comes around,
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.180]   we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.640]   and eventually at some point at night, we go to sleep.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.860]   So we go from alert to deeply calm.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.780]   And as we do that, we go from an ability
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.000]   to engage in these very focused duration path
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.580]   outcome types of analyses
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.780]   to states in sleep that are completely divorced
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.480]   from duration path and outcome
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.840]   in which everything is completely random and untethered
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.060]   in terms of our sensations,
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.060]   perceptions and feelings and so forth.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.500]   So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.220]   that is optimal for thinking and focusing
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.420]   and learning and neuroplasticity
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.760]   and doing all sorts of things.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.660]   We have energy as well.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.900]   And at another phase of our day,
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.380]   we're tired and we have no ability to focus.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.180]   We have no ability to engage
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.820]   in duration path outcome types of analyses.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.940]   And it's interesting that both phases are important
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.600]   for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.580]   So if we want to engage in neuroplasticity
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.260]   and we want to get the most out of our nervous system,
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.680]   we each have to master that both the transition
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.800]   between wakefulness and sleep
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.480]   and the transition between sleep and wakefulness.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.900]   Now, so much has been made of the importance of sleep
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.500]   and it is critically important for wound healing,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.040]   for learning as I just mentioned,
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.020]   for consolidating learning,
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:47.340]   for all aspects of our immune system.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.480]   It is the one period of time
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.140]   in which we're not doing these duration path
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.720]   and outcomes types of analyses.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.180]   And it is critically important to all aspects of our health,
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.560]   including our longevity.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.100]   Much less has been made, however,
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.780]   of how to get better at sleeping,
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.780]   how to get better at the process
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.620]   that involves falling asleep, staying asleep,
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:10.060]   and accessing the states of mind and body
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.720]   that involve total paralysis.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.560]   Most people don't know this,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.900]   but you're actually paralyzed during much of your sleep
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.540]   so that you can't act out your dreams, presumably.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.800]   But also where your brain is in a total idle state
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.000]   where it's not controlling anything,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.060]   it's just left to kind of free run.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.880]   And there are certain things that we can all do
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.400]   in order to master that transition,
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.340]   in order to get better at sleeping.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.680]   And it involves much more than just how much we sleep.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.400]   We're all being told, of course, that we need to sleep more,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.760]   but there's also the issue of sleep quality,
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.320]   accessing those deep states of non-DPO thinking,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.100]   accessing the right timing of sleep.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.780]   Not a lot has been discussed publicly,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.540]   as far as I'm aware, of when to time your sleep.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.380]   I think we all can appreciate that sleeping
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:57.840]   for half an hour throughout the day
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.960]   so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.040]   every 24-hour cycle is probably very different
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.220]   and not optimal compared to a solid block
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.340]   of eight hours of sleep.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.880]   Although there are people that have tried this.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.800]   I think it's been written about in various books.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.460]   Not many people can stick to that schedule.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.580]   Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman schedule,
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.020]   not to be confused with the Huberman schedule,
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:19.860]   because first of all,
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.280]   my schedule doesn't look anything like that.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.120]   And second of all,
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.480]   I would never attempt such a sleeping regime.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.840]   The other thing that is really important to understand
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.820]   is that we have not explored as a culture
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.820]   the rhythms that occur in our waking states.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.220]   So much has been focused on the value of sleep
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.420]   and the importance of sleep, which is great,
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.920]   but I don't think that most people are paying attention
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.740]   to what's happening in their waking states
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.500]   and when their brain is optimized for focus,
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.880]   when their brain is optimized for these DPOs,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.100]   these duration path outcome types of engagements
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.200]   for learning and for changing,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.320]   and when their brain is probably better suited
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.520]   for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   And it turns out that there's a vast amount
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.360]   of scientific data which points to the existence
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.460]   of what are called ultradian rhythms.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:10.760]   You may have heard of circadian rhythms.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.640]   Circadian means circa about a day.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.120]   So it's 24 hour rhythms
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.080]   'cause the earth spins once every 24 hours.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.640]   Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   and they require less time, they're shorter.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.120]   The most important ultradian rhythm
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.640]   for sake of this discussion is the 90 minute rhythm
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.000]   that we're going through all the time
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   in our ability to attend and focus.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.400]   And in sleep, our sleep is broken up
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.500]   into 90 minute segments.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.140]   Early in the night, we have more phase one and phase two,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.560]   lighter sleep, and then we go into our deeper phase three
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.400]   and phase four sleep,
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.520]   and then we return to phase one, two, three, four.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.180]   So all night, you're going through these ultradian rhythms
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.360]   of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.940]   it's repeating.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.720]   Most people perhaps know that, maybe they don't,
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.120]   but when you wake up in the morning,
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.280]   these ultradian rhythms continue.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.480]   And it turns out that we are optimized
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.500]   for focus and attention within these 90 minute cycles
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.800]   so that at the beginning of one of these 90 minute cycles,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.480]   maybe you sit down to learn something new
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.720]   or to engage in some new challenging behavior.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.160]   For the first five or 10 minutes of one of those cycles,
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.800]   it's well known that the brain and the neural circuits
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.840]   and the neuromodulators are not gonna be optimally tuned
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.080]   to whatever it is you're trying to do.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.560]   But as you drop deeper into that 90 minute cycle,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.240]   your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO process
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.280]   and to direct neural plasticity and to learn
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.700]   is actually much greater.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.180]   And then you eventually pop out of that
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.060]   at the end of the 90 minute cycle.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.120]   So these cycles are occurring in sleep
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.300]   and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.960]   And all of those are governed by this seesaw
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.320]   of alertness to calmness
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.600]   that we call the autonomic nervous system.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.340]   So if you want to master and control your nervous system,
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.400]   regardless of what tool you reach to,
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.040]   whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.640]   or whether or not it's a behavioral tool
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.960]   or whether or not it's a brain machine interface tool,
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.560]   it's vitally important to understand
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.560]   that your entire existence is occurring
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.140]   in these 90 minute cycles,
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.000]   whether or not you're asleep or awake.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.520]   And so you really need to learn
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.620]   how to wedge into those 90 minute cycles.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.880]   And for instance, it would be completely crazy
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.020]   and counterproductive to try and just learn information
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.300]   while in deep sleep by listening to that information
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.440]   'cause you're not able to access it.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.320]   It would be perfectly good, however,
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.200]   to engage in a focus bout of learning each day.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.180]   And now we know how long that focus bout
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.120]   of learning should be.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.360]   It should be at least one 90 minute cycle
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.120]   and the expectation should be that the early phase
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.260]   of that cycle is going to be challenging.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.100]   It's going to hurt.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.280]   It's not going to feel natural.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.180]   It's not going to feel like flow,
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.280]   but that you can learn and the circuits of your brain
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.160]   that are involved in focus and motivation
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.780]   can learn to drop in to a mode of more focus,
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.360]   get more neural plasticity, in other words,
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.080]   by engaging these ultradian cycles
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.300]   at the appropriate times of day.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.500]   For instance, some people are very good learners
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.080]   early in the day and not so good in the afternoon.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.820]   So you can start to explore this process
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.640]   even without any information
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.060]   about the underlying neurochemicals
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.880]   by simply paying attention,
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.320]   not just to when you go to sleep
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   and when you wake up each morning,
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.020]   how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively,
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.320]   but also throughout the day
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.440]   when your brain tends to be most anxious,
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.820]   because it turns out that has a correlate
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:34.800]   related to perception that we will talk about.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.180]   You can ask yourself, when are you most focused?
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.340]   When are you least anxious?
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.000]   When do you feel most motivated?
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.920]   When do you feel least motivated?
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.640]   By understanding how the different aspects
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.480]   of your perception, sensation, feeling,
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.020]   thought and actions tend to want to be engaged
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.460]   or not want to be engaged,
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.900]   you develop a very good window
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.600]   into what's going to be required
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.560]   to shift your ability to focus
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.340]   or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.760]   at different times of day, should you choose.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.860]   And so that's where we're heading going forward.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.660]   It all starts with mastering this seesaw
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:12.440]   that is the autonomic nervous system
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.780]   that at a course level is a transition
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.800]   between wakefulness and sleep,
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.500]   but at a finer level and just as important
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.560]   are the various cycles,
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.200]   these ultradian 90 minute cycles
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   that govern our life all the time,
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.420]   24 hours a day, every day of our life.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.540]   And so we're going to talk about
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.080]   how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:33.100]   so that you can better access neuroplasticity,
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.760]   better access sleep,
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.660]   even take advantage of the phase
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.880]   that is the transition between sleep and waking
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.520]   to access things like creativity and so forth.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.860]   All based on studies that have been published
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.020]   over the last hundred years,
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.660]   mainly within the last 10 years
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.300]   and some that are very, very new
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.660]   and that point to the use of specific tools
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.380]   that will allow you to get the most
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.120]   out of your nervous system.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.640]   So today we covered a lot of information.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.420]   It was sort of a whirlwind tour
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.760]   of everything from neurons and synapses
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.460]   to neuroplasticity in the autonomic nervous system.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.220]   We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.560]   So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass,
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.440]   please don't worry.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.440]   We will come back to these themes over and over again.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.960]   I wanted to equip you with a language
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.280]   that we're all developing a kind of common base set
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.200]   of information going forward.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   And I hope the information is valuable to you
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.320]   when you're thinking about what is working well for you
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.360]   and what's working less well
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.020]   and what's been exceedingly challenging,
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.640]   what's been easy for you in terms of your pursuit
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.300]   of particular behaviors or emotional states,
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.280]   where your challenges or the challenges of people
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.680]   that you know might reside.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.700]   As promised in our welcome video,
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.720]   the format of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.000]   is to dive deep into individual topics
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.060]   for an entire month at a time.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.000]   So for the entire month of January,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.580]   we're going to explore this incredible state
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.440]   that is sleep and a related state,
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.980]   which is non-sleep deep rest.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.940]   And what they do for things like learning,
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.080]   resetting our emotional capacity.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.480]   Everyone's probably familiar with the fact
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   that when we're sleep deprived,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.980]   we're so much less good at dealing with life circumstances.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.920]   We're more emotionally labile.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.760]   Why is that?
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.740]   How is that?
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.580]   But most importantly,
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.520]   we're going to talk about how to get better at sleeping
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.280]   and then how to access better sleep,
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.260]   even when your sleep timing or duration is compromised.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.260]   We're also going to talk about the data
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.980]   that support this very interesting state
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.500]   called non-sleep deep rest,
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.140]   where one is neither asleep nor awake,
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.160]   but it turns out one can recover
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.580]   some of the neuromodulators and more importantly,
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.600]   the processes involved in sensation, perception,
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.020]   feeling, thought, and action.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.460]   It's sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.420]   where I'm answering your questions and providing tools.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.320]   And I'm certain you're also going to learn
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.280]   a lot of information about neuroscience
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.180]   and what makes up this incredible phase of your life
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.640]   where you think you're not conscious,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.220]   but you're actually resetting and renewing yourself
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.120]   in order to perform better, feel better, et cetera,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.560]   in the waking state.
