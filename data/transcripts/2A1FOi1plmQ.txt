[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   - What's in your view is the difference
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.120]   between our perception, like how we think the world is,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.280]   and reality?
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   Do you think there's a huge gap there?
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   Like we delude ourselves that the whole thing
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.280]   is an illusion, just everything about human psychology,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   the way we see things, and how things actually are.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   In all the things you've studied, what's your sense?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.880]   How big is the gap between reality and perception?
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.840]   - Well, again, purely speculative.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.880]   I think that we will never know the answer.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.540]   We cannot know the answer.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.920]   There is no experiment to find an answer to that question.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.200]   Everything we experience is an event in our brain.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.820]   When I look at a cat, I'm not even,
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.640]   I can't prove that there's a cat there.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.880]   All I am experiencing is the perception of a cat
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   inside my own brain.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.280]   I am only a witness to the events of my mind.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.040]   I think it is very useful to infer that
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   if I witness the event of cat in my head,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.140]   it's because I'm looking at a cat that is literally there
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.980]   and has its own feelings and motivations
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.020]   and should be pet and given food and water and love.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.860]   I think that's the way you should live your life.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.440]   But whether or not we live in a simulation
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.960]   on the brain in a vat, I don't know.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.860]   - And do you care?
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.420]   - I don't really, well, I care
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.500]   because it's a fascinating question.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.540]   And it's a fantastic way to get people excited about
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.180]   all kinds of topics, physics, psychology,
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.020]   consciousness, philosophy.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.980]   But at the end of the day, what would the difference be?
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.820]   If you--
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.740]   - The cat needs to be fed at the end of the day.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.620]   Otherwise, it'll be a dead cat.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.380]   - Right, but if it's not even a real cat,
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.300]   then it's just like a video game cat.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.400]   And right, so what's the difference
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.740]   between killing a digital cat in a video game
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.300]   because of neglect versus a real cat?
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.520]   It seems very different to us psychologically.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.860]   Like I don't really feel bad about,
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.360]   oh my gosh, I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi, right?
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.380]   But I would feel terrible if I forgot to feed my actual cats.
