[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Every so often we get an email in the inbox that just leaves me dumbstruck.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Usually such a question comes with not only a pointed question to it,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   but with real life hurt and pain behind it from a listener that's seeking genuine answers
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   to alleviate core identity struggles in their lives, like the email I'm about to read today.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   It comes to us from a listener named Elizabeth. Here it is.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   "Pastor John, I was conceived using the sperm of an anonymous donor.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   My parents, who are believers, wanted a child very badly, but my father was infertile,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   so they chose to purchase sperm from a fertility clinic.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   My biological donor father was paid to give his sperm to the clinic.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   My parents chose not to tell me about the conception until after I was married,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   and when I was told I was shocked and hurt and struggled to find my identity for years.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I rest in the thought that God is my father, and I am always drawn to scriptures and songs
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   about God as father to help settle my confused heart.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   At least 60,000 children are born through donor conception every year in the United States,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   so I know this is impacting local churches, though it's rarely discussed.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Reproductive technology is moving fast, and couples can choose to purchase sperm or eggs
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   from a more fertile person or use the embryos left over from others
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   who made more embryos than they wanted.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   My questions to you are twofold.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Number one, does God desire some couples to remain childless to the point that using the sperm
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   or eggs of a third person is resistance to his will?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And number two, do you have any scripture grace for those of us who are the product
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   of reproductive technology and who feel a bit like we were sold off as a commodity
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and abandoned by a biological parent in order to make another family happy?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   In answer to Elizabeth's first question, does God desire some couples to remain childless
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   to the point that using the sperm or eggs of a third person is resistance to his will?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   My answer would be yes.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   In other words, I don't think childlessness leads to the kinds of harmful effects
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   that have come from the massive move towards various kinds of surrogacy
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and reproductive artificiality outside the womb that have resulted, for example,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   in three-quarters of a million frozen babies whose natural parents do not want them,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   not to mention other harmful effects.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Childlessness is painful, but it is not sinful, and it is not destructive of human life.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And there is great grace that God has for the childless.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I don't claim by any means to have the last word on the ever-changing world of reproductive technologies,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   but I would refer Elizabeth and the rest of our listeners to the wisdom of Jennifer Lahl, L-A-H-L,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and the work of the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network, which she leads.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   She has drawn clear attention in various videos to the unforeseen damaging effects,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   especially in regards to surrogacy.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I'm very sympathetic with her view that the wisest and most compassionate course of action
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   in all these matters is to stay close to the natural processes of reproduction,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   which God designed, which basically means keeping eggs and sperm in our bodies.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's the way she put it to me when I asked her this question once.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   With regard to Elizabeth's second question, I think the Bible has even more clear guidance
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and gracious encouragement.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   She asked, "Do you have any scripture or any grace, any scripture grace,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   to give to those of us who are the product of reproductive technology
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and who feel a bit like we were sold off as a commodity
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and abandoned by a biological parent in order to make another family happy?"
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And the first thing I would say to Elizabeth is that her situation is not peculiar
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   or limited to those who are born through some kind of reproductive technology.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   There are those who were born because of rape and those who were born because of casual sex in a brothel
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and those who were born because of an accident when their parents didn't mean to get pregnant,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   didn't want to get pregnant, and those who were given up for adoption through all kinds of motivations,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   some good, some bad, and those who have absolutely no idea where they come from or who their parents were.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now, all of these people must deal with the feeling of being, at best, accidental,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and at worst, unwanted, tainted because of their origin.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Now, my approach to encouraging people with these kinds of roots is not mainly to romanticize those roots
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   and say that the biological parents were noble, probably, and compassionate and caring.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I simply don't know this in most cases, and I have far better news, better, better, better, better news than that
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   for Elizabeth, for my own adoptive daughter, and others whose origins are unknown or unsavory.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Paradoxically, I think making the picture darker before we make it brighter
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   will result in the greatest possible brightness for Elizabeth's identity and hope and joy.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The way to bring a darkness that makes things darker is to point out that every human being is born contaminated by sin.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "In sin did our mothers conceive us," David said in Psalm 51.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And Paul says that by one man, namely Adam's disobedience, the many, the rest of us, all of us, were made sinners.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   "By nature," he says, "we are all children of wrath," according to Ephesians 2.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Now, that condition is far, far, far worse than any condition created by reproductive technologies.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   This condition, if it is not remedied, is going to result in our eternal destruction.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   No reproductive technology causes that.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So things are far worse for all of us than they are for Elizabeth
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   only because of the circumstances surrounding her conception.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Now, what makes that darker observation about us turn out for greater brightness
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   is that with complete awareness of this corruption, this worst condition,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   God Almighty, in great mercy and great grace, has been pursuing not just our healing from that corruption
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and not just our escape from destruction.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   He has been, wonder of wonders, pursuing our inclusion in His family.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And He has been pursuing that at the cost of His Son's life.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   This is the spectacular center of the Christian gospel.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   This is what Christianity is about at its center.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Listen to Ephesians 1, 4-7.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "In love He predestined us for adoption to Himself as sons through Jesus Christ,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   with which He has blessed us in the Beloved.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   In Him we have redemption through His blood."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   In other words, it cost Jesus His life to get this adoption for us.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   "The forgiveness of our sins according to the riches of His grace."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And then here's a second text, Romans 8-16.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   provided we suffer with Him in order that we may be glorified with Him."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   In other words, in spite of God's full awareness of the contamination of our souls
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   from their very moment of origin, He is not only eager to remove that contamination,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   but He is eager to adopt us, make us His children,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   make us heirs with His eternal Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   and do it all through the redemption by the blood of His Son.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   This, this is the rock-solid, unshakable, always valid, always reliable truth about you, Elizabeth.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And compared to the sorrow of thinking that biological parents treated you as a commodity,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   which is a sorrow, compared to the sorrow of that thought and that reality,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   the fact that God has desired you as a daughter,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   bought you at the cost of His Son's life, is 10,000 times more precious
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and more important than that thought.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   That's what I have prayed over my daughter.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's what she would feel as an adoptive daughter into our family,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   and then God be praised, his family not knowing what was in her biological parents' heart.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   It is a glorious thing to have a foundation for our identity and our acceptance with God
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   that is as sure and as unshakable as the decrees of God Almighty.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Thank you for being so deeply moving and edifying and applicable for all of us, Pastor John.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And Elizabeth, wow, thank you for opening up your life to us like this.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's humble on your part.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's brave on your part, and it's really greatly appreciated,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   as your story is going to encourage many other people through this podcast.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So thank you for sending us the email to begin with.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And thank you to everyone who listens in.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   You can stay current with the Ask Pastor John podcast on your phone or device
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   or through your preferred podcast catcher.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And you can search our past episodes in our archive and send us an email of your own.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   You can do those things through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   While we are justified by faith alone as a glorious truth,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   we are not ultimately saved by faith alone.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   That statement in a DG article that you wrote, Pastor John,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   has stirred up quite a lot of debate and controversy online,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and I think that it's the right time to circle back on it and to hear you explain it more fully.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   How are we justified by faith alone but not saved by faith alone?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's a very important topic, very important conversation,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   and we need to have it next time when we return.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   That's on Friday.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   We'll see you then.
