[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.680]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.660]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.460]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.280]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.560]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.680]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.960]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.760]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.020]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.040]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.840]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.500]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.680]   I've been getting my blood work done for many years now,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.100]   and that's for the simple reason
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.980]   that only through quality blood work,
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.320]   and now through the advent of DNA tests,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.120]   can one really get a clear picture
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.080]   of what's going on with their health.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.020]   Things like metabolic factors and hormones,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.860]   all the various triglycerides,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.580]   these are things that can only be measured
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.280]   from a quality blood test.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.520]   And now with DNA tests,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.220]   you can get an additional window
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.860]   into your current health status
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.840]   and the trajectory of your health.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.060]   What's really wonderful about InsideTracker
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.160]   is that you don't just get numbers back
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.600]   about the specific levels of various hormones
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.880]   and metabolic factors.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.320]   You also get a lot of information
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.100]   about what you could or should do
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.960]   in order to adjust those numbers
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.500]   to put you on the course to better health.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.900]   So for instance, it will give recommendations
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.520]   about particular foods to eat or avoid,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.000]   particular exercise regimens that you might want to adopt
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.560]   and the frequency of those regimens
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.760]   in order to move those markers in the correct direction.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.500]   InsideTracker has also added a new feature
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840]   that makes tracking your progress
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   and analyzing your data even easier.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   For those of you that use a Garmin fitness tracker
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.160]   such as the Garmin watch,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.220]   that's now compatible with their platform.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.040]   So you can couple your data from your Garmin
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.600]   with your blood and DNA for even more personalization
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.940]   and insights on your health.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.960]   However, if you don't have a Garmin device,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.640]   there's still a lot that you can get
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.820]   from InsideTracker and their tests.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.340]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.440]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.880]   And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.320]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.380]   to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.880]   and use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.760]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by ExpressVPN.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.140]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.700]   that keeps your data secure and private.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.900]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.680]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'm familiar with the effects
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.100]   of not securing my data well enough.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.040]   A few years back, I had my bank accounts hacked.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.080]   I don't know exactly how it happened,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.440]   but it happened and it was a terrible amount of work
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.700]   to have that reversed and secured.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.360]   The great thing about ExpressVPN
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.360]   is I don't even notice that it's running.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.300]   I have it on my computer.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.600]   I turn it on anytime I work at home or when traveling
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.760]   or in a cafe, airport, anywhere.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.960]   And it runs in the background.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.800]   It doesn't change anything about the interface
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.840]   with my computer or the wifi.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   It just secures my data and it secures any information
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   about what I happen to be searching for, et cetera.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   I don't feel like I have anything particular to hide
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.400]   except my bank account passwords and things of that sort.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.440]   But with ExpressVPN, it basically makes everything secure.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.920]   You can't be tracked and no one can access
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.800]   or steal your data, which is terrific.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.740]   So again, I use it when I'm traveling and when I'm at home.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.980]   If you want to start protecting your internet activity
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.980]   using ExpressVPN, you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.560]   and you'll get an extra three months free
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.760]   on a one-year package.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   That's expressvpn.com/huberman
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.280]   to get three months free on any of their one-year packages.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.680]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.480]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.060]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.200]   that gives you a total foundation of vitamins and minerals
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.080]   and probiotics to support your health and wellbeing.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.320]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.720]   I started using Athletic Greens
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680]   and I still use Athletic Greens once or twice a day
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.520]   because it's the simplest and most straightforward way
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.240]   to get my basis of important vitamins, minerals
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   and probiotics taken care of.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.280]   All of those things combined to support various aspects
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.000]   of my health, such as brain health, such as gut health.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.440]   For instance, there's a tremendous amount of evidence now
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.760]   showing that probiotics support gut health
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   and that the gut brain access is important
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.080]   for things like focus and cognition,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.160]   as well as for immune function
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.920]   and various aspects of physical health like metabolism.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.140]   The list sort of goes on and on.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.160]   With Athletic Greens, it has all these vitamins and minerals
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.520]   and various other things that are good for me.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.400]   And I actually really liked the way it tastes.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.720]   So the way I use it is once a day, sometimes twice a day,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.760]   I'll mix it up with water.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.880]   I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   I think it tastes great without the lemon or lime juice.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.580]   But when I add that, it's truly delicious to me.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.400]   And I'll drink that first thing in the day,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.020]   mid-morning sometimes instead.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.240]   And sometimes again in the later afternoon.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   I'm able to drink Athletic Greens late in the day
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   and not have it keep me awake.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.320]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.220]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.880]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.800]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.540]   which make mixing up Athletic Greens
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.980]   while you're on the road really simple and easy.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.740]   And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.280]   Vitamin D3, as many of you know, you can get from the sun,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.120]   but many people,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.680]   even if they're already getting a lot of sun exposure,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.080]   still have vitamin D3 levels that are too low.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.940]   And vitamin D3 is very important for a huge number
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.360]   of cardiovascular, immune, metabolic,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.140]   and other aspects of health.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.360]   So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.180]   you'll get the five free travel packs
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.700]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.580]   Today is the third episode in our series of episodes
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.040]   about physical and athletic skill performance
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.200]   and skill learning in general.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.880]   And today we're going to talk about the science
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.540]   of tools for fat loss.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.820]   And fat loss is something that interests
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.600]   a large number of people.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.440]   Many people want to lose fat.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.260]   Many people are athletes who need to lose fat.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.840]   And in general, we know that having body fat percentages
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.560]   that are too high is unhealthy for us.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.520]   And most people struggle to lose fat.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.580]   Most people struggle to lose weight generally,
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.040]   but most people especially struggle to lose body fat
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.440]   or what we call adipose tissue.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.840]   Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.820]   There's a lot of controversy.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.680]   Today we're going to talk about some things related
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.740]   to fat loss and that are powerful for fat loss
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.680]   that I'm guessing most of you have never heard about before.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.840]   You may have heard about a few of them,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.200]   but I'm guessing you haven't heard about all of them.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.320]   This episode is going to be rich with science-based tools
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.440]   that are gleaned from a variety of aspects of the literature
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   including the use of cold, including brown fat,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.480]   including something called beige fat.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.540]   We're going to talk about something called neat.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.720]   We're going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.440]   that are governed by your nervous system.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.680]   And this is, I think, an important gap
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.540]   that's missing in the discussion about fat loss.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.960]   You can hear a lot of information out there
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.320]   about the role of things like insulin and various diets
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.400]   like ketogenic diets or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.100]   And there's some great stuff out there
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.980]   and there's some really terrible information out there
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.880]   and there's a lot of controversy.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.500]   We did a number of episodes talking about
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.180]   the role of hormones on metabolism
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.560]   and the role of food on mood and wellbeing.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.280]   So if you're interested in those topics,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.580]   please check them out.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.240]   I will touch a little bit on hormones today,
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.200]   things like insulin and leptin, just a little bit.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.240]   But today's episode is mainly going to be focused on
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.760]   how the nervous system, neurons,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.040]   and some of the cells they collaborate with
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.260]   like glia and macrophages,
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.080]   how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.600]   because it turns out they can.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.800]   Remember your nervous system,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.260]   which includes your brain and your spinal cord
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.160]   and all the connections that they make
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.820]   with the organs of the body, governs everything.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.800]   It's the on switch and the off switch for your immune system.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.520]   It's the on switch and the off switch,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   it turns out, also for fat burning.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.840]   And so the nervous system and the role of the brain
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.320]   and other neurons has been vastly overlooked
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.820]   in the discussion about losing fat.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.420]   Now, I would be remiss
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.740]   and I'd probably come under a pretty considerable attack
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.060]   if I didn't just acknowledge upfront
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.940]   a core truth of metabolic science
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.140]   and also of neuroscience, frankly,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.440]   which is that calories in versus calories out,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.740]   meaning how many calories you ingest
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.700]   versus how many calories you burn,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.560]   is the fundamental and most important formula
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.440]   in this business of fat loss
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.260]   and weight management in general.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.220]   There's simply no way around the fact
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.440]   that if you ingest far more calories than you burn,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.840]   you're likely to gain weight.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.360]   And a good portion of that weight
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.080]   is likely to be adipose tissue, fat.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.620]   It's also true that if you ingest fewer calories
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.420]   than you burn, that you will lose weight
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.060]   and that a significant portion of that
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.660]   will come from body fat.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.040]   What portion depends on the number of factors,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.180]   but that simple formula is important.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.060]   On a previous episode, I mentioned the complications
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.120]   with the statement of a calorie is a calorie.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.000]   And indeed, there is evidence from, for instance,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.260]   Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.200]   at UC San Francisco,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.260]   has talked about how highly processed foods
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.780]   change the way that we utilize food
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.100]   and can lead to higher incidences of obesity
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.300]   and other metabolic syndromes
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.520]   that go against the idea that a calorie is a calorie
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   and that's it.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.920]   So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.800]   and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.840]   but the calories burned portion is strongly influenced
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.800]   by a number of things that you can control
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.960]   that can greatly accelerate
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.840]   or increase the amount of adipose tissue
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.760]   or the proportion of adipose tissue
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.820]   that you burn in response to exercise and food.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.160]   So your hormones are important.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.320]   Your thermogenic milieu,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.560]   meaning how warm or how cold your body is,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.220]   how cold you make it, how warm you make it,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.160]   but also your level of metabolism,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   your levels of thyroid hormone,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.880]   and something that's hardly ever discussed,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.280]   but is well supported by the scientific literature,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.000]   how much innervation,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.200]   meaning how much connectivity there is
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.780]   between your nervous system and fat.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.300]   Today, we're going to talk about the fact
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.140]   that your body fat of various kinds,
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.480]   and there are several kinds of body fat,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.680]   are actually innervated by neurons.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.480]   Neurons connect to your body fat
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.680]   and can change the probability
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.200]   that that body fat will be burned or not.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.360]   So your nervous system is the master controller
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.800]   of this process,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.200]   and it plays a strong role in the calories out,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.180]   the calories burned component.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.800]   So as usual, we're going to discuss a little bit of science.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.020]   I promise I won't go too deep into lipolysis
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.720]   and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.700]   We're going to break down that process
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.960]   into two important steps.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.380]   And if you can understand those two important steps,
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.440]   then the rest of the tools will be very straightforward
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.480]   to understand and manage.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.200]   And I do believe that today you will walk away
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.820]   with many new tools that you could incorporate
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.160]   into any kind of fat loss regimen
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.520]   that will greatly accelerate that process
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.440]   because it's grounded in quality peer-reviewed science.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.460]   Throughout the episode,
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.940]   I'm going to talk about some behavioral tools.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.380]   In fact, I'll mostly talk about behavioral tools.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.460]   I will also talk about compounds, supplements.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.400]   Many of you are into supplements.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.180]   Some of you aren't, and that's fine.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.180]   For those of you that are into supplements,
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.320]   an important issue in a discussion about supplements
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   for fat loss or otherwise
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.420]   is going to be the quality of those supplements
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.640]   and the accuracy about what's in those supplement bottles
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.600]   and tablets, et cetera.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.580]   I usually mention this at the end of the podcast,
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.720]   but this podcast, we've partnered with Thorne,
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.360]   T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne, we believe,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.120]   has the highest levels of stringency
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.640]   in terms of the quality of the compounds
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.300]   in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.040]   If you want to see the supplements I take,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.400]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.120]   You can see the supplements that I take.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.060]   That will also allow you to get 20% off
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.200]   any of those supplements
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.600]   or 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.560]   Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.260]   and all the major sports teams,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.040]   so there's a very strong basis for their stringency.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.220]   Again, you don't need to use supplements.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.760]   I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to use supplements
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.180]   if that's not your thing,
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.520]   but if you're going to use supplements,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.920]   make sure that your supplement source
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.140]   is one of very high quality.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.880]   With that said, I want to get started
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.820]   and talk about the various tools for fat loss
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.440]   and how neuroscience, neurons, control fat loss.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.240]   Before I do that, I want to set the context correctly
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.600]   and extract some of the key takeaways
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.300]   from previous episodes,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.120]   because if your foundation of health
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   and your foundation of hormones
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.480]   and your foundation of metabolism isn't right,
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.800]   it's going to be very hard to get the most
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.820]   out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.600]   In previous episodes, I talked all about the science
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.260]   and the details going into particular protocols.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.560]   We don't have time to do that now,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.240]   and I want to get to the new material.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.960]   However, there are a couple bins,
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.080]   a couple items that you should make sure
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.520]   you're getting correctly.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.960]   And if you're not perfect about these,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.840]   don't worry about it.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.460]   Most people are not perfect about them.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.360]   I'm certainly not perfect about them,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.760]   but we should all be striving to get quality
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.280]   and sufficient sleep.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.180]   I did four full episodes on sleep
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.920]   and how to get better at sleeping
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.840]   through things like light exposure, temperature,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.720]   timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.200]   if you're a night owl or a morning person.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.120]   That's the first four or I think five episodes
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.760]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.660]   Get your sleep right, get your light exposure right,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.440]   avoid bright light in your eyes
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   at times you want to be asleep,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.280]   and get bright light in your eyes
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.920]   at times you want to be awake.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.560]   So get your sleep right.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.920]   The other thing is essential fatty acids.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.660]   I talked about this in the food and mood episode,
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.640]   but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.120]   We need fatty acids.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.920]   They are vital to so many aspects of our health.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.680]   You don't have to get them from supplements.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.560]   You can if you want to,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.360]   but you need to get them from your food.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.600]   They are essential.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.940]   There's a reason there's an E, the essential part there.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.460]   Of the fatty acids, there are multiple kinds,
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.140]   but for the antidepressant effects
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.220]   or the levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.140]   and also healthy metabolism
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.540]   and will start to shift the needle in the right direction
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.900]   on bloodborne cardiovascular factors,
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.060]   the key thing is to get the levels of EPA that you ingest
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.600]   above 1,000 milligrams per day.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.440]   So that doesn't mean just taking 1,000 milligrams or more
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.620]   of say fish oil or krill oil
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.520]   or whatever your preferred source is.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.140]   It means getting above 1,000 milligrams of EPA,
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.480]   which may require that you ingest more essential fatty acids
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.500]   than just 1,000 milligrams per day.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.660]   That of course can be done through food sources,
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.980]   things like fatty fish,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.460]   or if you're not into eating fish,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.940]   you have quality meats that are grass-raised can do that.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.240]   There are other sources of essential fatty acids,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.720]   of course, also from plant sources.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.020]   So look those up online.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.300]   It's really easy to find,
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.360]   but the research and the literature shows
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.820]   that you want to get above 1,000 milligrams of EPA per day
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.360]   because that's when you can best support your metabolism
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.820]   and position yourself for good fat loss.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.700]   As well, for people who have cravings issues,
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.420]   they crave sweets all the time.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.980]   I talked about this in the gut brain episode
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.260]   and hormones and food,
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.220]   that you have neurons in your gut that are craving,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.300]   they're seeking essential fatty acids
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.340]   and they're craving and seeking amino acids from your food.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.160]   Now, these are not supplements that they crave per se,
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.400]   they're craving those things
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.080]   because that's what your body needs and your brain needs.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.300]   But those same neurons will respond to sugars.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.860]   And so many people who are craving sugar
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.320]   can satisfy that sugar craving
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.440]   by giving the neurons, so to speak,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.680]   what they actually want,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.240]   which are amino acids and essential fatty acids.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.680]   That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.700]   an amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.100]   if you take a teaspoon of that,
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.280]   or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.560]   You have to ease into that a little bit
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.720]   because some people can get a little bit of GI distress
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.120]   from too much glutamine.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.460]   But glutamine has also been shown
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.460]   to improve symptoms of leaky gut.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.300]   It's a powerful amino acid.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.220]   And yes, you can also get it from food.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.100]   Things like cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.840]   And then finally, you can't really position yourself
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.220]   to have a strong metabolism
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.180]   if your iodine levels aren't correct
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.380]   and your thyroid levels aren't correct.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.280]   You can overdo iodine, so you don't want to do that.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.880]   A lot of table salt has iodine added to it,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.680]   but some people need to add iodine
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.640]   by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.000]   But one of the best ways to support the thyroid system
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.280]   and metabolism in general
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.200]   is to make sure you're getting enough selenium,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.180]   sometimes called selenium.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.860]   Each day, simple way to do that
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.680]   is to ingest the highest concentration of selenium food
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.540]   One or two or three of those per day,
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.000]   you'll have more than enough selenium
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.400]   to meet the thyroid needs.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.900]   You don't want your selenium to be too high.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.920]   You don't want a diet too high in anything.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.320]   Glutamine, if you have issues with leaky gut
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.020]   or sugar cravings can really help.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.920]   Get your gut microbiome right.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.120]   I may have missed saying that,
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.080]   but get your gut microbiome right.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.480]   That does not necessarily mean
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.500]   you need to ingest probiotics.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.040]   You can if you want to,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.320]   but you can also just simply ingest a serving or two
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.800]   of fermented foods per day.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   That can greatly assist.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.600]   So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.520]   every culture has a different source
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.400]   or sources of fermented foods.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   Those can really help the gut microbiome.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.440]   And then make sure that your thyroid hormone is supported
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.960]   through the ingestion of sufficient iodine, not too much,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.880]   and sufficient selenium, not too much.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.040]   Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, iodine, selenium.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   That sets the basis for how things like exercise, cold
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.720]   and some of the compounds and other things
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.800]   that we're going to talk about today
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.680]   that are I'm guessing truly going to be truly new
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.320]   to many of you that can really increase the burn factor
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.840]   in the equation of calories in versus calories burned.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.800]   So on the one hand, we have this reality
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.960]   of calories in versus calories burned.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   However, I would also be remiss
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.160]   if I didn't mention an incredible study
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.600]   that was done by my colleague, Alia Crum at Stanford.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.720]   She's a faculty member, a professor
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   in the psychology department.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.040]   Looking at how belief effects, just thinking,
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.200]   can impact the effects of things like exercise
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.480]   on weight loss.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   These are just incredible results.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.380]   What they did was they took subjects
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.040]   who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.340]   and come in and change the linens and so forth,
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.200]   divide them into two groups.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.320]   One group, they were told moving around
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.000]   and doing your duties for your job,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.300]   meet the standards for US guidelines
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.800]   for activity and movement, et cetera.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.400]   And a basic lecture about how movement
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.900]   is good for you, et cetera.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.760]   But mostly just that their daily activities
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.600]   met the standards for the US.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.880]   The other group, however, was given a bunch of information
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.040]   about how movement and their daily routine
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.640]   was very good for cardiovascular health,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.840]   it could be good for weight loss, et cetera.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.500]   And then they tracked these subjects
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.760]   over a period of many weeks.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.280]   The take-home message from this study
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.020]   was that simply being told that movement is good for you
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.620]   can lead to weight loss, et cetera,
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.880]   led to significantly more body fat loss,
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.260]   waist to hip ratio changes in the direction
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.760]   that most people would want.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.600]   Essentially a slimming down, if you will.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   And all sorts of other positive effects
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.340]   on things like cardiovascular health,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.320]   simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.760]   can help various health markers.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.480]   So this is remarkable and it speaks to the power
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.060]   of the nervous system and the power of belief
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.760]   in governing aspects of our body and our physiology
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.360]   that one would otherwise think
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.160]   were outside our conscious control.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.600]   Now, of course, any of you that think scientifically,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.660]   which I imagine if you watch this podcast
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.800]   or listen to this podcast is all of you by now,
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.120]   probably thinking, well, maybe they just moved around more,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.320]   or maybe they stood up and sat down more,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   maybe they did something else that was different.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   And indeed there's a strong possibility
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.640]   that they did things differently than the other group.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   But the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.380]   that movement is good for you shifted their behavior
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.180]   and their physiology in the direction
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.000]   of enhanced weight loss, fat loss, et cetera.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.860]   So how we think about a given set of activities
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.760]   affects how we perform those activities
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.200]   and how we think about and perform those activities
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.440]   has a real effect on our physiology.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.920]   So somewhere between the hard and fast rule
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.360]   that governs fat loss and weight loss,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.480]   which is if you ingest more calories than you burn,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   you'll either maintain or gain weight,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.660]   typically you'll gain weight, although not always.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.120]   If you ingest about as many calories as you burn,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   you maintain weight typically.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.160]   And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn,
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.240]   typically you'll lose weight.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.660]   That's the kind of rule of fat loss.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.960]   And yet we also have these belief effects which show,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.080]   and this has been replicated again and again,
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.080]   that how we think about a process,
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.600]   whether or not we think it's beneficial
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.920]   can change our physiology in ways
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.040]   that can be beneficial to us.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.880]   Somewhere in between those two extremes
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.640]   of hardcore metabolic science and belief effects
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.460]   lie a bunch of protocols that are grounded
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.400]   in quality peer-reviewed science and in physiology
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.540]   that you can leverage to increase the rates of fat loss.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.900]   And so that's what we're going to talk about today.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.720]   I love this topic and it's not that I'm so obsessed
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.320]   with fat loss, but rather the first project
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.120]   I ever worked on in science was thermogenesis and fat loss.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.160]   I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.940]   and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.800]   and how they impacted thermogenesis.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.680]   And so we looked at how things like MDMA, ecstasy,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.160]   how antipsychotics, antidepressants,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.700]   various weight loss drugs that were on the market,
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.240]   how those impacted body temperature
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.940]   and fat loss and metabolism.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.400]   And we just had so much fun doing it.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.920]   So if you detect a smile on my face,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.960]   that's what that's about.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.760]   And I also learned a lot and I also came
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.400]   to really appreciate that this tissue of our bodies,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.800]   adipose tissue and fat,
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.220]   we think of as just this unfortunate thing,
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.320]   this like we're told it's a core energy source
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.440]   if we ever entered a famine and that's all true, et cetera.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.840]   We come to realize that these cells in our body,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.820]   which is our metabolism and there's a third player.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.180]   And that's where it really gets interesting
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.740]   that the nervous system, neurons has the opportunity
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.740]   to turn up the intensity of that furnace.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.380]   It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.480]   that we produce and therefore the amount of energy
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.500]   that we burn.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.300]   And I was also really intrigued by something
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.400]   which is that growing up, I think we all know people
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.780]   who can eat a ton and never seem to gain any body fat
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.620]   or people who seem to eat very little
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.340]   and seem to gain body fat very easily.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.600]   And I was always intrigued by that and it turns out
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.480]   there are a number of different factors that relate to that
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.300]   but the nervous system is the one that we can really control
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.880]   both through behaviors and what we eat
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.260]   but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.380]   There was one particular story I want to relate to you
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.800]   that does not suggest any protocol.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.420]   In fact, I'm going to discourage you
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.100]   from following this protocol.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.300]   Please do not try the compound that I'm about to describe.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.260]   One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.220]   was to find rare compounds and test them.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.860]   And at the time I was reading about thermogenesis
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.580]   and I learned about a compound that was actually discovered
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.880]   in the armory factories of World War II.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.860]   And it was discovered because women in particular
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.980]   who were working in these factories would take a brush
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.040]   and dip it in a compound or a paint rather
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.100]   and they would then paint the numbers with a stencil
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.820]   onto things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.440]   And they were losing weight like crazy.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.420]   It turns out that occasionally they'd lick the brush
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.420]   and then they would go back
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.500]   just to get a sharper point on the brush
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.140]   and then they would paint onto these various bullets
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.020]   and missiles and so forth, bombs and so forth.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.300]   And they started shedding all their body fat.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.860]   And many of them lost a lot of weight,
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.540]   a significant portion of their weight
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.380]   without changing anything else that they were doing,
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.120]   what they were eating, et cetera.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.380]   Turned out that that compound
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.180]   is something called dinitrophenol, DNP.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.460]   And over the years, dinitrophenol, DNP,
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.020]   has gained popularity in some niche cultures,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.900]   mainly bodybuilders, athletes,
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.140]   even in the kind of modeling industry.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.980]   It is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to use
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.680]   because it's highly fatal
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.020]   if your body temperature goes too high.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.460]   Hyperthermia will kill you.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.620]   And indeed, many people have died
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.940]   using dinitrophenol as a weight loss drug
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.380]   or attempting to use it as a weight loss drug.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.800]   But dinitrophenol really illustrates a principle,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.860]   which is that your metabolism
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.380]   includes things like thyroid hormone
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.180]   and growth hormone, et cetera,
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.940]   but your body temperature and the way you utilize energy
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.820]   is controlled by your nervous system.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.520]   And the way dinitrophenol works is by changing the neurons
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.380]   and the way that the neurons that connect to fat
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.160]   change the way fat burns up.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.360]   So we are not going to suggest,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.120]   I am not suggesting that you use dinitrophenol.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.980]   However, there are other things that you can do
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.780]   that can change the relationship
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.040]   between these neurons and the fat of your body
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.880]   in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.860]   And I don't know why we don't hear about these things more,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.520]   but probably because most of what you see out there
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.200]   on the internet focuses more on what you could eat
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.020]   and should eat or shouldn't eat.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.400]   It concentrates on exercise regimens,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.300]   which we will also talk about.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   But the burn factor, your thermogenic environment
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.860]   is one of the, if not the most important factors
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.980]   in this business of fat loss.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.400]   And since I'm a neuroscientist,
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.100]   that's what we're going to talk about.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.240]   So let's talk about fat utilization.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.020]   Let's talk about how fat is converted into energy,
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.100]   which is sometimes also called fat burning.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.780]   What I'd like you to know
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.820]   is that this is a two-part process, okay?
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.220]   In reality, there are many biochemical steps.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.080]   And if you log onto the internet or you open up a textbook
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.800]   and you want to learn about fat utilization,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.340]   you're going to see a lot of chemistry.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.960]   And I'm happy to go deep into that chemistry if you like,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.240]   but I think most of you are probably interested
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.480]   in what are the leverage points?
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.060]   Where can you exert control over this process
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.320]   in ways that benefit you?
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.080]   So I'm going to focus mainly on those, okay?
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.280]   This is not to upset the aficionados
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.800]   and I will put in some nomenclature, but here we go.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.520]   There's two parts to this process.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.640]   One is fat mobilization.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   And the second is fat oxidation or utilization, okay?
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   So the first thing that has to happen
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.360]   for body fat to get burned up or used and reduced
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.960]   is that it has to get mobilized.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.360]   And that's a process called lipolysis.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.320]   But I actually don't care if you know the name lipolysis,
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.920]   you just have to move that fat
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.340]   out of the position that it's in.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.660]   You have to get it out of the fat cells, all right?
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.120]   Fat cells can be visceral around our viscera, our organs,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.880]   or they can be subcutaneous under our skin.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.140]   Most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.920]   when they think about fat.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.300]   So here's the deal.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.120]   And if you want more detail, great.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.580]   I'll touch on that in a bit.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.280]   But basically stored fat has two parts
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.600]   that are relevant here.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.240]   It's got the fatty acid part
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.480]   and that's the part that your body can use.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.680]   And that's attached to something called glycerol
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.500]   and they're linked by a backbone.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.460]   So already probably too much chemistry for both of you.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.780]   But what you want is you want to break the backbone.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.920]   So if you just can remember to mobilize fat,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.200]   you got to break the backbone
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.000]   between glycerol and these fatty acids, okay?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.640]   That's accomplished by an enzyme called lipase.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.920]   But you can forget all that if you want.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.180]   Remember, we're just trying to mobilize fat.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.460]   So the first step is to get those fatty acids moving around
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.600]   in the bloodstream to get them out of those fat cells.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.600]   And then they can travel and be used for energy.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.700]   And that second part, remember, first part is mobilization.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.720]   The second part is oxidation.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.880]   Is then those fatty acids, those are potential fuel.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.040]   They're just potential fuel,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.560]   but you haven't burned the fat yet.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.000]   You've just moved it out of your fat cells.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.600]   They're going to go into cells
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.760]   that can use them for energy.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.200]   And once they are inside those cells,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   they're still not burned up.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.520]   You need to oxidize them.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.780]   You think oxidation is the burnup part.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.120]   They need to be moved into the mitochondria
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.440]   and then they can be converted into ATP into energy.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.820]   So just to really zoom out again
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.980]   to make sure I don't lose anybody,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.240]   you got to mobilize the fat,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.320]   then you have to oxidize the fat.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.620]   In other words, you have to mobilize it,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.120]   then you actually have to convert it into energy.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.600]   If you just mobilize it
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.540]   and you don't convert it into energy, you don't oxidize it,
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.040]   it can be returned to body fat.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.480]   And many of the things that the nervous system can do
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.360]   is to increase the mobilization of fat,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.440]   but also the oxidation of fat, okay?
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.040]   So you have two opportunities to burn more fat.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.760]   And both of those opportunities
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.960]   are governed by your nervous system,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.340]   by neurons that literally send little wires
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.280]   that we call axons into fat and release chemicals
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.100]   that provide a stimulus for more of that fat
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.080]   to be mobilized and then later
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.640]   for more of that fat to be burned up, okay?
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.360]   So we could go really deep on this,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.120]   but I'm not going to go much deeper than that
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.360]   because this isn't a biochemistry
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.640]   of fatty acid metabolism lecture.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.460]   This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.680]   But remember, there's a mobilization step
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.580]   and then there's an oxidation step.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.360]   I think any one of you,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.200]   all of you should be able to internalize that.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.960]   Mobilize, then oxidize, okay?
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.640]   Mobilize, then oxidize.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.100]   So what are these neurons that connect to fat doing?
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.020]   What are they releasing exactly?
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.420]   How do they actually increase fat mobilization
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.880]   and how do they increase fat oxidation, burning of fat?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.020]   Well, there are a couple of things that they release
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.660]   that encourage that process.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.060]   And the main one that you need to know about
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.100]   is epinephrine or adrenaline.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.420]   The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.040]   in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   Okay?
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.300]   And adrenaline is released from two sources.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.420]   Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.380]   which sit atop our kidneys and our lower back.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.500]   And it's also released
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.580]   from the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.780]   although that name is a bit of a misnomer
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.900]   because it has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.320]   has to do with stimulating alertness
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.760]   and promoting action of the body.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.300]   There's a big mistake in the literature
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.160]   that is finally being corrected among those who know.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.360]   The mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.100]   and the release of adrenaline
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.320]   is what stimulates fat loss and fat oxidation.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.900]   In fact, it was thought for a long time
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.100]   that adrenaline swimming around in your body
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.400]   of when you're fasted,
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.460]   because fasting can increase adrenaline,
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.300]   or when you're engaging in intense exercise
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.220]   or when you're stressed is going to promote fat oxidation.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.060]   That's actually not the case.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.360]   The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.980]   the burning of fat,
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.640]   is coming from neurons that actually connect to the fat,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.940]   not hormones like adrenaline
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.340]   that are swimming around in your system.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.460]   It's a local process.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.820]   And this is very important
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.980]   because it means that what you do,
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.360]   the specific patterns of movements
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.660]   and the specific environment you create
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   that can stimulate these particular neurons
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.520]   to activate fat, meaning to release fat,
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.320]   to mobilize it, and then to burn it,
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.140]   is going to be a powerful lever that you can use
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   in order to increase fat loss.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.300]   So what have we said so far?
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.520]   We've said that you got to mobilize, you got to burn fat,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.820]   and that your nervous system is in control of that process.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.800]   It's not just about calorie deficit.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.700]   So let's talk about how to activate the nervous system
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.700]   in ways that it promotes more liberation, movement,
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.620]   mobilization of fat, and more oxidation of fat.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.040]   So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrine,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.340]   which is also called adrenaline,
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.420]   from these neurons that connect to fat
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.740]   and to thereby stimulate more fat mobilization
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.940]   and oxidation is through movement.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.600]   But I'm not talking about exercise.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.460]   The type of movement that I'm referring to
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.780]   is extremely subtle.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.820]   And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.840]   but I'm guessing you're probably not familiar
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.540]   with what I'm about to tell you,
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:31.540]   which is that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.620]   for the release of adrenaline, epinephrine, into fat
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.060]   and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.820]   But shiver is not just induced by cold,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.700]   and there are other subtle forms of movement
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.800]   that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.500]   There was a group in England during the 1960s and '70s
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.500]   that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.900]   can greatly increase fat loss.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.180]   This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.260]   It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.620]   And I learned about this early on
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.260]   when I was an undergraduate.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.460]   And I asked, how did they come across this?
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.000]   And here's how the story goes.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.660]   They were aware that some people overeat
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.680]   and yet don't put on weight.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.180]   Other people overeat even just a little bit,
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.860]   and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.900]   Now, this is long before all the discussions
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.360]   about microbiome and hormone factors,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.240]   and it was long before many of the hormone factors
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.340]   besides insulin had even been discovered.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.260]   What they did was they examined people
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.660]   who overate and did not gain weight.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.880]   And what they observed was that those people engaged
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.580]   in lots of subtle movement throughout the day.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.060]   In other words, they were fidgeters,
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.300]   and that's what they called them.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.400]   I'm not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.600]   but Rothwell and Stock were British.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.540]   What they found were people that overeat
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.220]   but don't gain weight as a consequence,
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.540]   and in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.500]   had a lot of resting tremor, not of the Parkinsonian type,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.020]   but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.280]   When they would talk,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.700]   they would engage in very angular movements.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.900]   They were sort of electric.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.460]   In fact, now in science, I was chuckling about this
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.180]   as I was diving back into this literature
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.380]   because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.700]   on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine,
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.980]   and we all adore him.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   He's over in Europe,
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.280]   and he's this tremendously successful scientist,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.500]   so we like to poke fun at him,
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.940]   and every one of his movements
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.340]   is incredibly electric and staccato,
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.060]   and he's rail thin and he eats like a horse,
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.160]   and so it fits very well
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.780]   into the discovery of Rothwell and Stock,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.080]   who discovered that fidgeters,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.260]   people that bounce their knee,
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.740]   people that have a head bob while they're listening,
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.980]   people that nod a lot,
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.820]   people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.300]   and people that pace burn anywhere from 800
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   to 2,500 calories more than the control group
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.420]   in the experiments that they looked at,
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.080]   and indeed, there's been a modern look into all this,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.900]   and these numbers check out
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.460]   that simply moving around a lot,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.780]   even if those are subtle movements,
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.700]   greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.860]   and people who overeat,
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.460]   the people who can have the second or the third donut
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.620]   or donuts at all and don't seem to put on weight
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.100]   to the same degree,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.180]   they are people that move around a lot even when seated.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.940]   They're people that will often move their limbs
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.340]   very quickly as well.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.820]   There even have been studies that have explored
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.500]   other things that correlate with fidgeters.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.900]   Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.860]   or they start to gather their things very quickly,
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.900]   whereas non-fidgeters don't,
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.860]   so dogs like my bulldog Costello,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.220]   definitely not a fidgeter.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.300]   Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.060]   Sitting down is a process.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.940]   If you ask him to sit down, it's sort of a slow motion.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.900]   You ask him to get up,
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.260]   and he kind of looks at you, sighs, and stands up.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.220]   The fidgeters are the opposite of that, right?
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   You say, "How are you doing?"
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.300]   They go, "Great."
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.060]   So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated,
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.060]   although not always,
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.000]   but staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.740]   And in 2015, and again in 2017,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.400]   there have been studies that have explored this
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.780]   using some modern metabolic tracking.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.020]   And indeed, simply moving a lot, being a fidgeter,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.100]   bouncing your knee, standing up and pacing,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.380]   several times or many times throughout the day,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.800]   led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.820]   when people were ingesting the same amount of food.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.880]   If they overate, they were able to compensate
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.640]   and burn off that food.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.400]   And if they were trying to lose weight,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.660]   and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.320]   of deliberately trying to fidget more
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.020]   and move around during the day,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.640]   pace, stand up more quickly, sit down more often,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.660]   sit down and stand up more often rather,
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.260]   they found that they greatly increased their weight loss
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.480]   anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.580]   And in some cases,
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.480]   there are always those few people who burned a lot more.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.180]   It seems to work best in people
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.000]   who are already slightly overweight.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.820]   So for people that are overweight,
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.500]   who are kind of averse to exercise,
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.460]   fidgeting might actually be a good entry point.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.100]   And 800 to 2,500 calories
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.560]   is a considerable amount of calories
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.140]   when you really think about it.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.360]   Now, why am I telling you this?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.320]   Well, there's clearly a tool to export from this,
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.540]   which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.580]   without having to go on additional long runs.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.560]   I do hope that people are exercising regularly
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.460]   because it's so important for other aspects
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.080]   of brain and body health.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.680]   But nonetheless, we are all time limited
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:04.920]   and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.280]   I have a family member
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.640]   who has been slowly coaxed into exercise,
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.200]   but if I were to tell her, for instance,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.400]   you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.960]   So this is a powerful way
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.600]   to increase the calories that are burned.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.640]   Now, that's great and you can think about the protocols,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   but I want to nest that protocol in what I said before,
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.420]   which is that fat is controlled by these neurons
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.280]   and the epinephrine they release.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.120]   You might say, well,
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.320]   how could these little micro movements
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.960]   lead to so much caloric burn?
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.900]   And that's where it really gets interesting.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.600]   Rothwell and Stock and others
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.960]   that they worked with subsequently found
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.200]   that these little fidgety movements,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.040]   the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.840]   that are nothing like exercise.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.300]   It's not these large coordinated or rhythmic body movements,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.440]   but rather subtle little bits of fidgety movement.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.180]   And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.200]   As an example, tapping the pen, this kind of thing.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.400]   I was probably that kid in class most of the time.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.160]   I was like, I try not to do it to irritate people,
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.520]   but I was definitely a knee bouncer.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.680]   I'm not particularly lean or not,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.240]   but I was definitely, this is a common activity for me.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.840]   People that do that sort of thing,
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.280]   it turns out that it's not the kind of caloric burn
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.640]   that we normally think of, of like,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.240]   oh, you're running, lifting weights,
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.560]   swimming, yoga, et cetera.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.240]   Those subtle movements of our core musculature,
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.480]   not just the core, but all our limbs and our musculature,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.880]   those low level movements,
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.720]   they trigger epinephrine release from these neurons
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.880]   and they stimulate the mobilization of fat.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.920]   And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.480]   And I find this fascinating.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.840]   I wish more people knew about it,
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.780]   which is why I'm telling you about it today.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.820]   This has nothing to do with exercise
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.200]   in the traditional form.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.240]   And yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.760]   that's a considerable amount of fat oxidized.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.840]   If you are in a calorie maintenance mode
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.240]   or if you're sub caloric,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.040]   that's going to add to still additional fat loss.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.240]   The data on this are tremendous.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.420]   I'll link to a few studies.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.920]   If you're really interested in learning
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.960]   about what's called NEAT, N-E-A-T,
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.940]   which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis, NEAT.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.460]   So what's the protocol?
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.920]   Fidget.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.060]   If you're really interested in burning calories
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.840]   and you already exercise, you want to burn more,
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.340]   or you don't have the opportunity to exercise,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.640]   or you're a versed exercise for whatever reason,
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.800]   fidgeting movements, staccato movements, standing up,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.760]   walking around, pacing,
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.500]   all the sort of nervous activities
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.220]   that we're so critical of in other people
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:51.140]   and sometimes in ourselves are actually mobilizing
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.980]   and oxidizing a lot of fat and a lot of energy.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.560]   And while this probably won't compensate
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.140]   for chronic overeating,
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.000]   the caloric burn from this is considerable
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.320]   and very likely can offset a meal
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.920]   that had excessive calories
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.900]   or a kind of steady state of eating too much.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.260]   And it also starts to open up all sorts of thoughts
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.720]   and discussion about when you travel,
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.960]   you tend to eat foods that are outside your normal ones.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.520]   We tend to eat foods that aren't so great for us.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.280]   We also tend to be a little bit more sedentary
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.700]   when we travel, we're on the plane, et cetera.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.160]   But all of that aside,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.800]   just the use of something like low-level movement,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   and it's almost like a tremor,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.520]   but also these short, small, fidgety movements.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.920]   I'm intentionally doing a lot of these today,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   so you have examples that you can use
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.520]   that to select from if you like.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.680]   These can have a major effect on fat loss.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.040]   And it raises a second tool.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.660]   If these low, meaning these small movements
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.920]   that we engage in trigger epinephrine,
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.720]   adrenaline release from these neurons
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.940]   of the sympathetic nervous system that innervate fat
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.160]   and increase fat mobilization and oxidation,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.340]   now it should make sense why shivering
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.280]   is one of the strongest stimuli
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.900]   that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.040]   Now, shivering is almost always associated with cold.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.320]   We think shivering, we think cold,
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.840]   because when we get cold, we shiver.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.960]   And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.160]   And there are several ways that you can use shivering,
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.700]   you can leverage shivering,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.580]   and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss,
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.720]   but you have to do it correctly.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.220]   And most of the people that are using cold
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.180]   and frankly suggesting cold
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.420]   as a means to increase metabolism fat loss
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.340]   are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.920]   In fact, the one I'm going to recommend
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   is 180 degrees in the opposite direction
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.700]   to the typical protocol that you'd hear about.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.680]   So let's talk about how to use cold
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.980]   and how to leverage shiver
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.340]   as a particularly strong stimulus to increase fat loss
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.980]   through mobilization and oxidation of these fatty acids.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.280]   So in recent years, there's been a growing interest
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.720]   in the use of cold for various things
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.020]   like improving stress tolerance,
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.840]   improving metabolism, recovery from exercise.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.460]   I've talked about a number of those things
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.840]   and the uses of cold on this podcast.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   In fact, did an episode on how to supercharge performance
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.460]   through palmer cooling, cooling the palms in specific ways
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.180]   or the bottoms of the feet.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.820]   And if you're interested in that
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.540]   and how to improve performance in endurance and strength,
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.280]   you can check out that episode.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.820]   But most people out there are using cold exposure
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.920]   typically by taking cold showers
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.020]   or by getting into cold water of some other kind,
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.620]   a lake or a river or a cold bath or an ice bath.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.580]   And they are doing that probably with mixed goals,
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.080]   meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.560]   and burn fat as well as improve mental resilience.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.680]   Since today we're talking about accelerating fat loss
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.120]   through the use of science-based tools,
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.900]   I want to emphasize a study that was published in Nature
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.140]   just a couple of years ago,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.140]   showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:30.540]   So we have several kinds of fat, three kinds in fact.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.560]   We have white fat, white adipose tissue,
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.900]   and we have brown fat or brown adipose tissue.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:41.700]   And there's a third kind, which is beige adipose tissue.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.500]   White fat is the type that we traditionally think of
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.640]   as fat, subcutaneous fat.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.380]   And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.860]   it is there as an energy storage site.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.820]   And we have to mobilize the fat out
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.740]   as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.080]   Brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.800]   and on the back of our neck, between the scapulae.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.440]   And it's rich with mitochondria,
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.880]   which is why it's called brown fat.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.560]   And brown fat has a particular biochemical cascade
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.660]   whereby it can take food energy,
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.740]   and it can take food basically, break it down
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.360]   and convert it into energy within those cells.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.020]   And there's some additional steps involved,
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.820]   but unlike fatty acids from white fat,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.160]   which have to travel elsewhere,
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.300]   get broken down in mitochondria
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.340]   and convert into ATP, et cetera,
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.900]   used by the mitochondria rather,
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.220]   brown fat is thermogenic.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.520]   It can actually use energy directly.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.860]   It skips a step, and I don't want to get diverted
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.780]   by going into all the biochemistry of it.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.180]   Beige fat is sort of in between.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.940]   It's white fat that could be brown fat
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.200]   because it has some mitochondria in it,
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.260]   but not as many as brown fat.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.100]   Now, cold exposure does several things.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.500]   Making ourselves cold can allow us
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.060]   to build up mental resilience
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.180]   because getting into cold of any kind,
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.940]   doesn't matter if it's a cryo chamber,
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.380]   doesn't matter if it's a cold day
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.660]   and you forgot your sweater or your parka.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.300]   It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.160]   or you're lying down in the snow.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.200]   Cold causes the release of adrenaline from your adrenals
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.900]   and it causes the release of epinephrine
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.360]   from these neurons that connect to fat.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism and fat burning
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.480]   are going to be through two routes.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.200]   One is that if you expose yourself to cold,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:49.020]   you have the opportunity to trigger activation of brown fat
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.940]   as well as to convert more beige fat into true brown fat.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.620]   So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter furnace.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.160]   That's the way to think about brown fat.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.120]   It's like a furnace.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.580]   And so with this principle that we started with
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.160]   of calories in versus calories burned,
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.020]   what you're doing is you're increasing
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.320]   the amount of burning.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.900]   You're increasing the burn of energy
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.520]   by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you,
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.360]   so to speak.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.040]   Okay, I'm talking here kind of metaphorically.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.880]   Now, how can you do that?
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.220]   Well, if you get into cold water or an ice bath
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.100]   or a cold day and you try and remain calm
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.100]   and resist shivering, you actually short circuit
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.980]   this mechanism for increasing brown fat thermogenesis.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.040]   The paper published in "Nature" shows
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.280]   that it is shivering itself
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.040]   that causes the brown fat to increase your burning,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.000]   your burn rate and your metabolism.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.260]   And it works like this.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.240]   When you get into cold and you shiver,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.560]   the shivering, that low level movement of the muscle,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.880]   those small movements, triggers the release
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.880]   of a molecule called succinate, S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.840]   And succinate acts on the brown fat
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.700]   to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning overall.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.560]   It actually increases body heat
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.760]   through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.220]   And it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.480]   by converting beige fat into true brown fat.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.360]   Now, how much cold exposure and how often, that's the key.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:37.060]   But before I give that detail or set of details,
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.800]   remember if you resist the shiver,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.880]   you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.240]   because you are not going to get the succinate release.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.020]   So if you want to get your body heat,
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.960]   your thermogenic level to go up, you need to shiver.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.320]   So now we have the NEET,
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.460]   the non-exercise activity thermogenesis,
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.840]   so low levels of activity as I described before,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.720]   which are done away from cold,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.000]   maybe do them in cold as well,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.600]   as well as shiver in response to cold.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.280]   And so the shiver itself is valuable
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.600]   for triggering the release of succinate.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.900]   In fact, succinate is being evolved now by various drug
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.720]   manufacturers as a potential treatment for obesity,
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.460]   although it hasn't really hit the market
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.720]   in its final form yet.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.460]   Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:27.200]   So how many times a week do you need to expose yourself
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.600]   to cold will depend on how much fat you're trying to lose
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.900]   and how much you're trying to increase your metabolism.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.800]   There are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.280]   of exposing yourself to cold either through cold shower
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.500]   or through ice bath or other cold water.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.860]   It doesn't have to actually have ice in it
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.920]   provided it's cold enough for any time, anywhere,
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.160]   excuse me, between one and five times per week.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.380]   But it turns out that just one exposure per week
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.840]   can be valuable.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.360]   The question then is how long
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.520]   to get into that cold environment
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.040]   and how cold should that environment be?
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.900]   So first let's talk about how long
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.440]   to get into that cold environment.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.280]   The answer here might be a little bit different
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   than you might imagine.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.920]   Most of you might think, oh, well, if one minute is good,
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.000]   three minutes is better.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.640]   And if three minutes is better, then 10 minutes is best.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:24.360]   But remember the goal is to get the shiver induced release
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.260]   of succinate so that succinate can trigger the brown fat.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:33.440]   It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver,
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.580]   what you want to do is to get into the cold
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.140]   and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.640]   and then get back into the cold and out of the cold.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.120]   That will definitely stimulate more shivering
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:48.380]   than just getting into the cold itself.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.640]   So what I'm not referring to
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.900]   is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.980]   and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.580]   You also don't want to get hypothermic
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.480]   and I want to be clear,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.040]   you want to get approval from your doctor
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.340]   before you do any of this.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.020]   When you get into cold water,
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.740]   there are two factors that will dictate
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.180]   whether or not you shiver.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.420]   Probably three, but let's just talk about the main two.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.620]   One is how cold it is.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   So how cold should it be?
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.580]   And look, if you get into water that's very, very cold,
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.020]   it can actually shock your heart.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.440]   It can actually give you a heart attack
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.100]   if it's truly, truly ice cold
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.740]   and you're not adapted to that.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.900]   So proceed with caution, please.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.080]   I'm not a physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.820]   Cold, just cold enough to be uncomfortable
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.660]   is a good place to start.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.200]   So for some of you, that's going to be 60 degrees.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.180]   For some of you, that's going to be 55 degrees.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.120]   For some of you, it's going to be high 30s, right?
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.740]   Depends on how cold adapted you are
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.300]   and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.100]   So what you need to do is find a temperature
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.100]   that you can get into one to five,
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.700]   probably one to three times a week
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.160]   if you really want this to accelerate fat loss
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.420]   and you want to get in until you just start to shiver
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.780]   and then you want to get out and not dry off.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.240]   Wait anywhere from one to three minutes
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.020]   and then get back into the cold.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:12.540]   Now you'll notice when you get back into the cold,
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.540]   it'll almost seem soothing.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.660]   It might actually not induce shiver.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.460]   It might take away the shiver that you had.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.840]   So here's a potential kind of sets reps protocol
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.820]   that you can play with.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.800]   Find a temperature that induces shiver for you.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.020]   That's going to vary depending on your cold tolerance
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.540]   and how cold adapted you are.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.980]   One to three, maybe five times a week,
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.760]   get in until you or get under the shower or whatever it is
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.940]   until you start to shiver, genuinely shiver.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.360]   Then after about a minute or so get out,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.820]   spend one to three minutes out, but don't dry off.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.600]   Get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.460]   but try and access the shiver point again.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.860]   And you might do three repetitions of that.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.740]   So it's three times in and three times out total, okay?
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.660]   That's a great starting place.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:05.340]   And what you don't want to do is build up your tolerance
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.960]   to cold so fast that pretty soon you're able to resist
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.400]   the shiver because remember the shiver is the source
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.940]   of the succinate release that will trigger
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.940]   brown fat thermogenesis.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.260]   So if you'd like to see this protocol spelled out,
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.260]   you can access it zero cost at a website,
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.820]   which is thecoldplunge.com.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.340]   The Cold Plunge is a company.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.940]   They make cold plunges and they were kind enough
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.680]   to gift one to the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.660]   But I want to emphasize that these protocols
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.720]   are free of cost.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.320]   The folks at the Cold Plunge are not just interested
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.660]   in marketing their product, but one of their main interests
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.460]   is encouraging people to engage in cold exposure
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.340]   for particular end points and goals like fat loss,
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.780]   resilience, et cetera, resisting inflammation.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:53.560]   But their main focus is providing people protocols
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.540]   and encouraging people to use cold exposure
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.540]   of various kinds, not just through their products,
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:00.700]   but through cold rivers and jumps in the ocean
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.580]   and things that cold showers, whatever is most convenient
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.660]   and accessible for various people.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.140]   And so we needed a place where we could house
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.580]   these protocols in a permanent way
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.940]   and not just for this episode.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.460]   So what they've agreed to do is to post the protocols there.
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.920]   They should be very easy to find on their website.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.020]   This particular protocol we're referring to
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:26.700]   as the fat loss optimization protocol
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.220]   for lack of a better name.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.020]   And it's really grounded in how cold can be used
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.340]   to induce shiver.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.580]   And again, it doesn't really matter
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.620]   how you're accessing that cold
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.340]   provided you access the shiver
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.460]   and you're moving from the cold environment
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.480]   to a slightly warmer environment.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.980]   So getting out of the cold shower
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.420]   or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera,
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.880]   or out of the Cold Plunge and then back in.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.820]   Because it turns out that the cooling and rewarming process
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.660]   of the body is where shiver kicks in.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.300]   And so that's distinctly different
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.860]   than just trying to get into the cold
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.380]   and stay in the cold for as long as possible.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.300]   And if you zoom out a little bit
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.140]   and think about some examples in life,
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:09.100]   you'll understand why that must be the case.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:12.720]   For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.100]   you have these polar bear clubs,
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.780]   I think they call themselves,
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.060]   do these cold water swims.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.820]   I would sometimes see these people swimming back
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:22.420]   in Vortha Alcatraz and stuff like that, which seems risky.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.800]   And they tell me it's very stimulating
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.220]   for the mind and body, great.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.580]   Sometimes those people are very lean,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.320]   oftentimes they're not.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.080]   And they're getting a lot of cold exposure.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.260]   And one of the things that happens
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.580]   is if you expose yourself to cold over and over,
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.380]   you adapt, you become cold adapted.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.940]   And when you do that, you no longer get the epinephrine,
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.260]   the adrenaline release from the cold.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.800]   And therefore you don't get the succinate release
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.760]   and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.300]   quite as intensely.
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.940]   So if you want to use cold for other reasons,
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.920]   and certainly cold water swims can be fun,
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.420]   and as long as you can do them safely, they're great.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.920]   I've gotten into cold water swimming
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.580]   for some period of time.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.460]   You can use cold for resilience, et cetera.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:07.680]   But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss,
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.600]   then getting this shiver process going,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.960]   the cooling and rewarming, which accelerates the amount
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.560]   or increases the amount of shiver,
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.840]   that's going to be the way to go.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.920]   One note about cold and some of the factors
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.340]   that it releases.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.360]   A few years back, there was a lot of excitement
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.320]   about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.640]   which was associated with cold.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.760]   And there was a lot of excitement about its potential role
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.460]   in increasing metabolism.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.520]   So much so that people were starting to explore this
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.360]   as a potential fat loss drug.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.680]   To my knowledge, that went nowhere.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.980]   The science eventually shifted over to succinate
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.000]   as the main factor in cold-induced thermogenesis
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.680]   through this brown fat pathway.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.220]   But if anyone out there is aware of any positive effects
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.360]   of irisin or of any science of irisin
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.880]   that I'm overlooking here
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.220]   or that I'm speaking about incorrectly,
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.240]   please let me know, I'd be very curious to learn.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.840]   Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.480]   and talk about a period in your life
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.280]   in which you were rich with brown fat.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.880]   You had a ton of brown fat.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.300]   And that's when you were a baby.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.220]   Babies can't shiver.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:23.880]   These neurons that release epinephrine into fat
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.800]   are not wired up and really aren't present
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.760]   at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.280]   when you are a baby.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.100]   And therefore you can't shiver as a baby
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.400]   and you can't warm yourself up
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.020]   in cold environments very well.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.280]   To compensate for that,
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.140]   mother nature installed in all of us
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.240]   an excess of brown fat early in life
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.480]   that exists again in the upper back
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.080]   and the middle of the back and the back of the neck.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.200]   Over time, if we don't expose ourselves to cold environments
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   or do other things that make us shiver,
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.640]   we lose a lot of that brown fat.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.200]   But what's interesting about brown fat
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.760]   is that there's some evidence that brown fat,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:11.680]   just like white fat, can both increase in size
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.240]   but that you can also add new cells.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.640]   Now this is a little bit controversial.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.920]   People always say you can't change the number of fat cells.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.160]   You can just shrink them or increase their size.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.600]   Well, it turns out that epinephrine released
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.400]   from these little nerve endings in brown fat
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.720]   and succinate circulating in the body may,
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.120]   and I want to underscore may,
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.360]   have the effect of increasing the amount of brown fat cells
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.320]   probably by converting these beige fat cells into brown fat.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.260]   So that allows us to become much as we were early in life
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.560]   where we metabolized like crazy
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.600]   and we'd heat ourselves up without shivering.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.640]   Some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme,
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640]   putting ice packs on the back of their neck
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.080]   throughout the day.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   Did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.120]   and there's this, let's just call it a very niche,
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.760]   I have to imagine very, very niche culture of people
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.560]   who are wearing literally, I'm not joking,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.840]   they are these cool pack, ice pack underpants.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.720]   They go by a name that I'm not going to repeat on here,
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.320]   but you can find them on Amazon.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.000]   Those are people that are using cold packs on the body
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.020]   and on the groin to try and increase things like testosterone
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.840]   but as well to try and increase thermogenesis
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.400]   and trying to increase their metabolism.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.280]   Just remember, if you become cold adapted,
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.160]   you're not going to get the fat burning effects
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.280]   to the same degree.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.080]   So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.560]   but you don't want to adapt.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.920]   This is reminiscent of a rule that you hear about
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.000]   in endurance exercise and in strength exercise as well,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.760]   which is that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.800]   to promote growth or progress,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.920]   so growth of the muscle or improvements in endurance.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.880]   If you go 10% further on a run or 10% faster,
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.480]   you will likely see an improvement in performance
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   provided you recovery the next time you come back
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.560]   and do that same round of exercise.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.900]   You'll be able to do more work
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.800]   or complete the work more easily, et cetera.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.700]   You've adapted.
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.360]   If you do 20% more distance or 20% more weight,
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.400]   you won't necessarily see the same commiserate level
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.240]   of gain or improvement.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.420]   And so likewise with cold,
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.920]   if you're quickly moving from 30 seconds of exposure
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.280]   to 10 minutes of exposure,
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.400]   you're overlooking the opportunity
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.360]   to get the most fat loss and increase in metabolism
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.540]   by stepping it up in smaller increments, okay?
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.360]   And this also speaks to the rationale
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.020]   for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.120]   for certain periods,
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.480]   but then maybe not doing it year round
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.120]   if fat loss is your goal.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.520]   Maybe use it for two, three months at a time
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.200]   and then stop for two, three months at a time
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.800]   because it is such a potent stimulus
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.400]   provided you engage in the shiver.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.720]   Next, I'd like to move to exercise
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.280]   and how particular timing and types of exercise
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.120]   can vastly improve fat loss.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:05.960]   Before I do that,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.740]   I just want to mention a really important reference
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.900]   for those of you that are interested in learning more
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.780]   about how neurons connect to fat.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.280]   This is certainly a paper that you'd want to look at
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.100]   if you're interested in diving deep into the literature
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.080]   and reading all the various studies.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.280]   It's a review.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.760]   And the title of the review is
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.180]   Neural Innervation of White Adipose Tissue
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.660]   and the Control of Lipolysis.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.800]   That's Neural Innervation of White Adipose Tissue
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.300]   and the Control of Lipolysis.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.640]   It was published in Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.260]   You can find that free online.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.080]   They have the full text available.
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.120]   The first author is Bartnes, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.640]   It's a great review.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.180]   And I've talked about a number of things
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.720]   that are mentioned in the review.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.680]   Follow the references in that review
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.520]   and the reference trail, as we say,
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.480]   if you're interested in learning more about
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.600]   also how neurons control brown fat.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.440]   And before I move to exercise,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.260]   I also just want to highlight something
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.980]   that comes up every few years
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:06.260]   and has largely been considered myth now,
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.040]   but that is actually more interesting
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.800]   than most people might think,
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   which is this issue of spot reduction.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.880]   In the '80s and '90s, there were a lot of commercials,
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.460]   late night infomercials,
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.620]   where they would talk about spot reduction.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.580]   If you do sit-ups, will you lose abdominal fat?
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.520]   If you do hip raises or glute raises,
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.540]   will you lose glute and hip fat?
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.340]   And I think everybody now believes that
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.360]   and understands that fat metabolism
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.840]   is something that happens systemically throughout the body,
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.740]   that some body fat is "more stubborn" than others.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.620]   Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.560]   or lose fat last.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.440]   Number of factors that influence that,
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.320]   in particular hormone receptors.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   But now, at least in the scientific literature,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.480]   spot reduction and the possibility
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.740]   of real true spot reduction,
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.920]   reductions in fat in a targeted way,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.900]   a body part or body area targeted way,
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:11.720]   is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon,
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   because exercise that triggers the activation
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.820]   of these nerve fibers, these neurons that innervate fat,
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.120]   in theory, if you can increase
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.620]   the amount of epinephrine released
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.780]   at those particular fat pads, as they're called,
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.360]   they're actually called fat pads
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.300]   in the scientific literature,
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.760]   in theory, you could increase mobilization
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.300]   from those particular body fat sites.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.760]   Okay, so because the new view,
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.220]   that the modern understanding,
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.940]   is that it's not adrenaline released systemically,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.840]   kind of bathing all your fat tissue,
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.900]   but rather it's neurons releasing
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.960]   adrenaline epinephrine locally, that in theory,
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.240]   exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrine
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.920]   or exercise coupled with things like shiver
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.820]   or low-grade shaking movement or the NEET,
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.560]   the non-exercise activity thermogenesis,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:14.160]   could in theory lead to local enhancement
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.620]   of mobilization of fat tissue.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.280]   So I think that spot reduction actually will
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.200]   soon be something that's possible
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.260]   using the appropriate technology.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.820]   What does this mean for you now?
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.860]   What could you possibly do with this information now?
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.200]   Well, I think it speaks to the fact
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.940]   that if one is going to engage in exercise,
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.380]   that doing exercises that involve
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.960]   lots of different body parts and movements
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.220]   is likely to encourage the maintenance
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.920]   and or growth of these neurons
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.980]   that innervate fat throughout the body.
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.880]   What this means is changing up the pattern of exercise,
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.400]   engaging in novel types of movements
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.020]   may actually be one way that one can access
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.960]   these so-called stubborn body fat pads.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.400]   Now there's a little bit of speculation
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.940]   in the statement that I'm making,
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.440]   but if you think about it, it makes sense.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.980]   If you become very adapted
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.580]   to a particular pattern of exercise,
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.660]   whether or not you're subcaloric or not,
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.360]   you're in maintenance calories or not,
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.580]   you are oxidizing some fat always,
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.380]   and you're utilizing the neurons
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.260]   that innervate fat in a regular way,
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.580]   and pretty soon this innervation is going to shut off
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.620]   because there's no reason why this neural innervation of fat
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.620]   should continue to release epinephrine
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.860]   unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.760]   or the fidgeting, or in this case,
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.180]   to do novel forms of exercise.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.300]   And there's some anecdotal evidence,
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.020]   and there I don't even want to call it data,
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.540]   but anecdotal evidence that people
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.160]   who have quote unquote stubborn body fat,
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.760]   if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise,
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.100]   they can start to access those stubborn fat pads.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.240]   And again, fat pads is the correct way to refer to these
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.760]   in the scientific literature.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.620]   So what we're focusing on today
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:08.140]   is the fact that fat indeed will be mobilized and oxidized
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.460]   in response to a deficit in calories,
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.820]   but that the way that neurons control those fat pads
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.800]   and those body fat stores affords you a lot more control
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.520]   than perhaps you ever previously thought.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.700]   So let's talk about movement
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.360]   and the more traditional kinds of movement,
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.940]   AKA exercise, that has been shown to lead
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.860]   to increases in metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.600]   depending on whether or not, for instance,
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.020]   you're fasted when you do it or not,
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.720]   whether or not you do your cardio first
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.780]   or your resistance training first.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.160]   And this is, again, in a literature
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.920]   for which there's a lot of controversy,
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.020]   but in digging through all the studies on this,
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.480]   we're finally starting to arrive at a consensus
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.660]   of when is best to do exercise
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.920]   and what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.460]   The topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one,
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.460]   not as controversial as nutrition and diet,
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.740]   which we will talk about in a few minutes,
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.820]   but it's a particularly interesting one
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.820]   because different types of exercise
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.540]   engage the musculature of the body and the heart
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   and the lungs in different ways
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.300]   and can have vastly different effects
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.420]   on things like hormones and metabolism,
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.860]   depending on whether or not it's of high intensity,
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.300]   moderate intensity, or low intensity.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.580]   So rather than think about weight training
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.060]   versus cardiovascular exercise,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.860]   I think the most simple way,
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.740]   the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.120]   and fat loss is in terms of three general types of training,
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.140]   whether or not it's done with weights or body weight
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.100]   doesn't really matter.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.020]   And those are high intensity interval training,
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.380]   something that seems to have gained a lot of popularity
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.820]   in recent years, so-called HIIT, H-I-I-T.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.220]   So high intensity interval training,
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.980]   sprint interval training,
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.020]   so that's going to be very high intensity or S-I-T,
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.220]   or moderate intensity continuous training, M-I-C-T.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:05.780]   So we've got HIIT, SIT, and MICT, M-I-C-T.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.880]   And we can get a little bit more precise if you'd like.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.220]   I'm not somebody who measures my VO2 max or anything
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.060]   while I exercise.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.620]   I generally know whether or not I'm doing something
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.260]   I could continue for a very long time
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.880]   or whether or not I'm doing something
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.580]   that I realize is going to be of short duration,
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.420]   high intensity.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.340]   But if you'd like to map this to VO2 max,
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.040]   SIT, this sprint interval training was defined as all out,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.240]   greater than 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.960]   that last eight to 30 seconds,
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.100]   interspersed with less intense recovery periods.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:43.180]   So this would be sprinting downfield for eight to 30 seconds,
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.460]   then maybe walking back for about a minute or two,
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.220]   and then sprinting again and then continuing.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.420]   So that would be SIT.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:53.260]   HIIT, H-I-I-T, is defined as submaximal,
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.020]   so 80 to 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.300]   that last 60 to 240 seconds,
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.840]   interspersed with less intense recovery periods.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.980]   So on a standard 400 meter track,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:07.020]   just to give us a little bit of a visual,
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.220]   a four-minute mile would be fantastic for most people,
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.200]   although people run faster than that, of course.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.300]   So that's four 60-second laps,
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.480]   but that's back to back to back.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.720]   I think in my best shape, or maybe it was in my dreams,
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.560]   I don't recall which,
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.800]   I was able to do 60 seconds around the track,
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.740]   but of course I couldn't get that
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.880]   on the second or third or fourth.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   If I did, that was certainly in fantasy land and not reality.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:36.300]   But 60 seconds would be about one revolution around the track
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.160]   maybe 90 seconds, depending on how fast one is running.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.620]   So 60 to 240 seconds.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:47.520]   MICT, okay, this moderate intensity continuous training
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.180]   is steady state cardio,
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.600]   sometimes called zone two cardio these days on the internet,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   which is performed continuously for 20 to 60 minutes
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.020]   at moderate intensity of 40 to 60% of VO2 max,
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.020]   or if you prefer heart rate, 55 to 70% of max heart rate.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.060]   Okay?
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.960]   So we can think about high, medium,
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.560]   and low intensity exercise.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.340]   Although low intensity usually means
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.900]   that you could carry on a conversation,
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.480]   or maybe you'd have to gasp every few steps or so
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.920]   while trying to talk and run.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.320]   That's, I think, going to be the most useful way
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.120]   to have this conversation that we're having now,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.140]   because there's so many different forms of exercise
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.600]   that people do, and intensity is important.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.240]   Let's ask the question that I think many of people
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.960]   are wondering about, which is, is it better,
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.480]   meaning do you burn more fat
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   if you do your exercise fasted?
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.200]   And fasted in this respect could be
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.520]   that you wake up in the morning,
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.000]   you've been fasting all night,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   you just hydrate and you exercise,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.700]   or sometimes people will ingest caffeine.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.180]   There's controversy as to whether or not
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.760]   that quote unquote breaks the fast,
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.600]   has to do with whether or not your caffeine adapted,
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.200]   something for another episode.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.960]   In any case, that would be fasted,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.940]   so probably not having eaten anything
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:05.040]   for anywhere from three to 24 hours, or maybe even more.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.800]   'Cause you could also be fasted in the afternoon
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.080]   if you had lunch at noon, and it's four or five or 6 p.m.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.820]   Is it, will you burn more fat if you exercise
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.840]   without eating anything first,
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.940]   without ingesting any calories first?
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.040]   And people have tried to really split hairs on this
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.680]   every which way, people say, well, you can fat fast,
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.760]   because fat and protein doesn't lead
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.760]   to as great increases in insulin as other things.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.000]   Maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   And indeed, insulin will prevent fat oxidation.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.640]   I want to be really clear.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.480]   The burning part of fat in the cell,
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.600]   the movement of the fatty acid into mitochondria
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.080]   and the conversion to ATP, insulin inhibits that process.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.420]   However, it's been shown that,
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.340]   at least for short periods of training,
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.180]   it doesn't really seem to matter
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.260]   whether or not you eat before training or you don't
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.780]   if your goal is fat oxidation.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.580]   Now, I want to put an asterisk near that
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.960]   because there are some exceptions,
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.400]   but there were several studies done
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.540]   that, and the kind of the classic ones of these,
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.120]   I'll read out to you, what they basically did
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.200]   is they gave people glucose, sugar,
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.900]   to increase their blood sugar before training or not.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:25.300]   And the kind of classic study of this is Alborg.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:28.040]   et al., so 1976, so it goes way back,
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.360]   which is that glucose reduces fat burning in exercise.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.880]   And then some other studies,
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.720]   if you want to look these up,
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.120]   they're very easy to find on PubMed.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.860]   You put in Horowitz, 1999.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:40.520]   Lee et al. is another one
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.600]   where they have people drink milk with glucose in it,
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.460]   so sweet sugary milk before exercise, et cetera.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.920]   And you can find a number of examples
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.160]   where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.780]   that's oxidized during the exercise.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:59.960]   And you can also find a lot of studies showing
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.960]   that eating during exercise or prior to exercise
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.480]   will not reduce the amount of fat that's oxidized.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.520]   However, the types of exercise,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.840]   whether that was medium intensity or high intensity
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.280]   or low intensity is all over the map for these studies,
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.680]   so it's very hard to target an ideal protocol.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.520]   And then if you look really deep in the literature,
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.500]   you start to find meta-analyses
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.660]   where people have actually aggregated all the findings
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.000]   and some modern studies where it points
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.400]   to some very specific and useful protocols.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.200]   And so here's the rule or the protocol
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.380]   that I extracted from that literature.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:41.560]   At a period of about 90 minutes
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:46.160]   of moderate intensity exercise, I want to be clear,
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   at about or after 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise,
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.240]   there's a switchover point whereby if you ate
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.680]   before the exercise, you will reduce, excuse me,
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   you will burn far less fat from the 90 minute point onward
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.780]   than you would if you had gone into the training fasted.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.200]   So let me repeat that.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.680]   If it's moderate intensity,
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.220]   so-called zone two cardio type exercise,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.680]   at the 90 minute point,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.340]   if you happen to have eaten before the exercise
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.120]   within one to three hours prior to the exercise,
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.580]   then you reduce the amount of fat
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.000]   that you will burn from 90 minutes onward.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   Whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.680]   you hadn't eaten anything for three hours
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.960]   or more prior to the exercise,
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.400]   at the 90 minute point, 90 minutes of exercise,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.080]   you will start to burn more fat
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.040]   than you would had you eaten.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.640]   Now, 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise is a lot.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.700]   So that's a pretty long run.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.780]   Even if you're running at a pretty slow pace,
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:55.400]   like a 10 or 12 minute mile, that's a lot of running.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.280]   That's a lot of swimming.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.780]   So that's a lot of walking.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:58.920]   That's a lot of hiking.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.040]   However, there are people who are going out hiking all day
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.720]   or running all day or walking all day.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.000]   And if you want to burn more fat per unit time,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.300]   you want to oxidize more fat,
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.360]   then you would do that fasted.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.720]   Now, there are also studies that point to the fact
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.960]   that you don't have to wait to 90 minutes
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.200]   in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.560]   The studies I was able to find
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.000]   and that looked to me like quality peer reviewed studies
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.600]   with no company bias or no product bias of any kind,
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.920]   these are studies that were largely funded
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.920]   by the federal government in the university context,
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.280]   pointed to the fact that if one does high intensity training
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.200]   or even the very high intensity forms of training
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.620]   like sprints or squats or deadlifts
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.320]   or any kind of activity that can't be maintained
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.240]   for more than these eight or I would say up to 60 seconds.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.800]   So a set of lifting weights, repeated, repeated,
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.440]   if that's done for anywhere from 20 minutes,
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.800]   so weight training or powerlifting
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.020]   or these kinds of things or kettlebell swings
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:10.620]   or up to 60 minutes, well then the switchover point
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.240]   in which you can burn more fat
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.320]   if you go into that fasted comes earlier.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.840]   And this makes sense because there's nothing wholly
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.680]   about the 90 minute point
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.120]   for medium intensity zone two cardio.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.680]   That 90 minute point is the point
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.680]   in which the body shifts over from mainly burning glycogen,
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.480]   basically sugar that comes from muscles or the liver
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.580]   and realizes this is going on for a while,
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:42.080]   I'm going to shift over to a storage site fuel
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.460]   that is in reserve like body fat.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.720]   This is going to happen for a while
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.560]   so I'm going to start tapping into body fat stores.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.280]   Now fat doesn't have a little brain there.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.480]   It is innervated by neurons, but it doesn't have thoughts
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.080]   and you don't actually control this switch with your mind.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.220]   This is something that has to do
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.900]   with the milieu of various hormones.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.820]   What has to happen is insulin has to go down far enough.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.700]   So if you ate before the exercise,
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.300]   you'd have an increase in insulin.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.320]   If you ate carbohydrates,
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.940]   you'd have a bigger increase in insulin.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:13.480]   Fat and proteins indeed will have lower amounts of insulin
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.500]   and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.980]   Well, then that switchover point
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.940]   is going to come earlier in the exercise.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.740]   And if you think about it,
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.340]   if you were to do something high intensity
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.100]   for 20, 30, 40 minutes, so maybe lift weights
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.580]   and then get into zone two cardio.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.760]   If you were fasted, the literature says
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.980]   that you're going to burn more body fat per unit time
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.320]   than if you had eaten before or during the exercise.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.160]   So what does this mean?
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.420]   This means if you want to burn more body fat,
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.060]   if it's in your protocols
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.800]   and you have been approved to do this safely,
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:53.160]   exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.380]   The higher the intensity,
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:56.500]   obviously the shorter that bout is going to be
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.620]   and then move over into zone two cardio.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.040]   And if you do that fasted
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.780]   or the medium intensity cardio, I should say,
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.420]   and if you do that fasted,
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:07.380]   then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat.
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:11.580]   If you need to eat or you like to eat before you train,
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.240]   that also can work.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.940]   And if you train very intensely,
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.980]   you're likely to shift over
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:21.480]   to the fat burning pattern more quickly as well.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.340]   So again, this isn't really an issue
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.620]   of how long you exercise.
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.500]   It's an issue of how intensely you exercise
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.420]   and therefore what fuel source you're drawing from.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.100]   So hopefully I've made that clear,
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.700]   but basically you need to deplete glycogen
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.940]   or through high intensity exercise
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.280]   and then move to a steady state exercise
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.060]   that will allow you to burn more fat,
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:45.420]   or you need to perform a medium intensity
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.940]   or low intensity type exercise for a long period of time
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.980]   before you shift over to burning fat.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:53.200]   And indeed it seems that going into all that fasted
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.620]   will facilitate the burning of more fat overall.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.820]   But if you can't even get to the exercise,
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.820]   if you're somebody who just can't do the training at all,
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:06.260]   you're unwilling to, or you're incapable of training,
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.140]   unless you eat something,
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.220]   then obviously eating something makes the most sense.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.660]   And what you eat prior to exercise,
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.860]   that's a whole other biz that people argue about
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:16.260]   and fight about whether or not you should go into it
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.060]   with low carbohydrates or higher carb or all of that.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.300]   But in general, the theme there is very simple,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.660]   which is that you want insulin levels to be pretty low
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.340]   if your goal is body fat reduction,
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.900]   if you want to oxidize body fat.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.540]   So fasting in some cases, fat fasting in other cases
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.740]   where you're just ingesting fats, fat and protein
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.100]   in some cases, or for some people
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.700]   it will be eating carbohydrates.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.100]   I'm not here to dictate a particular nutrition regimen.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.220]   That's just how the hormone balance of these things
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.180]   and fat oxidation works.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.820]   Now, one thing that's very interesting
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.460]   and cannot be overlooked is this issue
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:51.900]   of how much energy you burn during and after the activity.
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.940]   And some of you probably already know about this,
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:58.580]   but the whole business of calories in versus calories out
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.160]   and people counting the number of calories they burn
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.780]   during their aerobic session or during their whatever session
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.020]   is only one half of the equation.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.900]   And it really eclipses the more important issue,
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:14.060]   which is how much of an increase in metabolism
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.540]   does a given exercise create after the exercise?
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.980]   And we could talk for hours about this,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.240]   but the simple way to view this
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.040]   is that high intensity training, anaerobic training
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.160]   of weight training, sprints, burpees, any kind of thing.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.560]   I don't know, these days I see,
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.080]   I hear that you're not supposed to do burpees,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.240]   that people think burpees are dangerous.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   So I'm not suggesting any particular movements here.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.040]   You have to decide what's right for you.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.160]   I do burpees, I don't seem to be injured from them,
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.280]   but I hear that they're terrible for some people.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.700]   So anyway, pushups, sit ups, whatever it happens to be,
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:50.680]   that anaerobic exercise that's of higher intensity
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.480]   or sprints taps into glycogen stores
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.880]   during the movement and will burn more energy
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.780]   per unit time than moderate intensity.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.560]   High intensity burns more than moderate intensity.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.720]   That's straightforward.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.800]   What's interesting is that all the studies
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.240]   that I was able to find on what happens
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.280]   after that type of exercise show that the percentage of fat
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.440]   that you burn after high intensity exercise
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.680]   is actually greater.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.320]   In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.120]   during the high intensity exercise.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.920]   And then after the exercise,
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.140]   the post-exercise oxygen consumption as it's sometimes called
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.940]   goes up, we know this after you train intensely
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.200]   that post-exercise oxygen consumption goes up
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.880]   sometimes for up to 24 hours.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.580]   And it is during that period of time
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:39.520]   that you oxidize more fat, not glycogen.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.900]   Now what's interesting is that the reverse is also true.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.640]   For people that do long bouts
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.880]   of low or moderate intensity exercise,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.560]   so typically this would be things like running,
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.680]   swimming, biking, et cetera.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.000]   So 60, 90 minutes, two hours,
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.880]   maybe even people that are training for marathons
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.900]   or half marathons, when they stop training,
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:01.600]   they burn more glycogen, more carbohydrate,
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.400]   even though they were burning more body fat per unit time
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.080]   during the low intensity exercise.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.480]   So there's this kind of inversion.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.960]   High intensity burns more glycogen during the activity,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.260]   more body fat afterwards.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.200]   Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage wise,
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.120]   more body fat is oxidized than glycogen
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.800]   during the actual exercise, afterward it's more glycogen.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.020]   So I don't want this to get too complicated.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.720]   The point is you should pick exercise that you like,
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.520]   that you're going to do regularly,
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.300]   but it does seem that the high intensity exercise
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.280]   followed by moderate intensity exercise
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.900]   is going to be optimal for fat burning overall.
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.380]   Because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.560]   and you look at the overall increase
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.440]   in basal metabolic rate,
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.580]   moderate and high intensity training
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.840]   followed by low intensity training,
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.540]   or even just followed by going back into life
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.660]   is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.240]   because of the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.700]   Now, this could be distilled into a simple protocol
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.340]   whereby three or four times a week
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:13.260]   you do high intensity training followed by either nothing
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.560]   or followed by low intensity training,
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.480]   especially if you're able to do that fasted.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.700]   And I should just mention that none of this stuff
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.700]   about fasted is about performance.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.860]   If you want to perform really well,
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:29.080]   this is for reasons of performance and you want to,
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.520]   it's for a sport or a competition,
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.160]   it's not for body fat purposes.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.560]   Well, then all of this kind of falls away
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.180]   and is modified by what's ideal to eat for performance.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.160]   But what we're talking about today
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.520]   is how to optimize body fat loss.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:47.520]   So train moderately to intensely to very high intensity
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.460]   and then moderate to low intensity,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:55.120]   or train moderate to high intensity and then go about life.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.980]   And in fact, I have a friend who uses this strategy.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.860]   He likes the train intensely and not that often protocol
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.140]   'cause he's a very busy person.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.780]   So he'll train for 20 or 30 minutes intensely with weights
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.300]   or just body weight movement doing a lot.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.580]   He does burpees and pushups and sit ups and pull ups
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.660]   and just kind of moving and kind of circuit type training.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.140]   But where he's breathing really hard,
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.180]   the goal he always says is I want to breathe hard
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.820]   for 30 minutes every day.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.700]   And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.520]   and moves into his day and he's walking around
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.820]   and taking calls and carrying around his children
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:26.820]   and doing all these kinds of things
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:27.660]   that keep him really busy
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.420]   with kind of like low intensity work.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.300]   So I think you get the principle now.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.880]   But you should all be asking yourselves
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.340]   as scientists of yourselves,
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.880]   why would it be that certain patterns of exercise
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.960]   would lead to more or less fat loss?
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.000]   I mean, it can't just be about the energy burned.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.500]   We already established that.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.500]   And again, it has to do with the neurons.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.040]   It has to do with how we engage the nervous system.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.180]   So while non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis,
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.560]   NEAT, the fidgeting, and cold can induce thermogenesis
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:01.020]   by engaging shiver type movement or low level movements,
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:04.440]   big movements that are of very high intensity,
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.960]   meaning they require a lot of effort,
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.300]   deploy a lot of adrenaline, epinephrine
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.940]   from our neurons and signal particular types
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:17.940]   and amounts of fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.460]   Whereas low level intensity exercise,
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.380]   low or moderate intensity exercise,
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.120]   walking, running, biking, where you can do that easily,
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.060]   there's not very much adrenaline release.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:31.420]   So adrenaline and AKA epinephrine
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.620]   is really the final common path
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.880]   by which movement of any kind,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.320]   whether or not it's low level shiver
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.300]   or whether or not it's lifting a barbell,
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.320]   sprinting up a hill, or doing a long bike ride,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.920]   adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.520]   It's the trigger and it's the effector.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.880]   So now I want to turn our attention to compounds
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.520]   that increase epinephrine and adrenaline,
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.240]   as well as compounds that work outside
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.720]   the adrenaline epinephrine pathway
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.080]   to increase the rates of fat loss.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.160]   I almost always save compounds and supplements
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.940]   and things of that sort to the end,
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.820]   because I do believe that people should look first
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.220]   toward behavioral tools and an understanding of the science
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:17.260]   before they look toward a supplement
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:21.280]   or a particular thing that they can extract from diet.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.040]   This is mainly to try and shift people away
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.180]   from the kind of magic pill phenomenon
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.080]   or the idea that there is a magic pill
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.660]   because there really isn't and frankly, there never will be.
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:30.920]   But there are some compounds
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.560]   that can greatly increase fat oxidation and mobilization.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.300]   And understanding which compounds increase oxidation
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.960]   or mobilization can be very useful
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.840]   if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:46.320]   There are things that people can ingest
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:50.060]   that will allow them to oxidize more fat.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.560]   And that occurs mainly by increasing the amount
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.120]   of epinephrine that is released from neurons
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.280]   that innervate fat tissue.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.720]   One of the more common ones
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.760]   is one that you may already be using, which is caffeine.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:06.780]   It's well-established that caffeine can enhance performance
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.240]   if you're caffeine adapted.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.180]   I talked about this in an earlier episode,
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.140]   so I want to make sure I'm very clear about this.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.400]   If you are not used to drinking caffeine
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.380]   and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.120]   a big cup of coffee before training,
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.220]   you will vasoconstrict and you will limit performance.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.480]   So that's performance.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.020]   If you're caffeine adapted, however,
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.920]   there's this kind of interesting phenomenon
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.180]   where ingestion of caffeine serves more as a performance
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.120]   enhancer, both by increasing alertness,
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.900]   but also by way of dilating vasculature,
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.300]   of allowing more blood flow.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.840]   Now, caffeine for burning more fat,
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.940]   for oxidizing and mobilizing more fat is an interesting one.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:54.560]   It can be effective at dosages up to 400 milligrams.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.900]   You have to be careful if you're caffeine sensitive.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.940]   Some people have just the littlest bit of caffeine
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.960]   and their mind goes crazy and they're very uncomfortable.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.080]   It can have cardiovascular effects for some people
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.280]   with hypertension, et cetera.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.040]   So please check with your doctor.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:12.040]   But 400 milligrams is roughly a cup and a half of coffee
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.280]   or two cups of coffee.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.480]   Nowadays, there's a lot more caffeine in coffee.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.760]   So if you go to a typical cafe
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.620]   and you were to get their medium size,
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.220]   that would have close to a gram of caffeine,
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:28.440]   which is why if you're a regular caffeine consumer
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.280]   and you don't get that gram of caffeine
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.320]   in your coffee each day, you will get a headache.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.200]   It can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.240]   in ways that's complicated, but you'll get a headache.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.040]   Some people like the way they feel,
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.160]   drinking 100 to 200, 300, maybe even 400 milligrams
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.300]   of caffeine before training.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:49.360]   And indeed that will lead to increased fat oxidation.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.280]   It will do that because you will release
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:53.460]   more epinephrine and adrenaline.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.700]   So let's just place this in the context
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.840]   of what we said previously.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.480]   Let's say you normally do zone two cardio.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:02.600]   So you're going out for a moderately intense run
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.040]   for 30 to 60 minutes or so.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.100]   I think the current recommendation guidelines in the States
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:11.560]   are that people engage in 30 minutes
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:16.520]   of moderate intensity exercise five days a week for,
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.420]   so that's 150 minutes, if their goal is to improve
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:23.360]   or maintain health of the cardiovascular system.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.900]   80% of people in the United States fail to do that
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.900]   or anything close to it.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.360]   We are way below threshold
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.480]   for what the government has recommended.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.020]   In this case, the government recommendations
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.940]   I think are pretty good.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.800]   One could always do better, of course,
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.480]   but 80% of people aren't even doing that.
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.360]   However, just using the logic and the understanding
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.000]   of how epinephrine, adrenaline
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.480]   is affecting this fat oxidation process.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.960]   If you were to go out for 15 minutes
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.380]   and you drank caffeine before you went,
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:58.840]   yes, you will probably oxidize more fat per unit time.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.120]   Can you compensate for the exercise you're not doing
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.000]   just by drinking caffeine?
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.380]   Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss,
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.040]   if that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right?
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.220]   The amount of calories that you burn in a 30 minute run,
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.860]   unless the run is very intense
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.900]   and you're wearing a weight vest and it's up a hill,
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.940]   it's not that great, right?
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.220]   But you probably get in somewhere
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:24.320]   into the 400, 500 calories burned area.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.060]   But I said earlier, and there are a lot of data now
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.560]   that support that fidgeting for a day
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.640]   can burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories a day.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.600]   So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than running.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.680]   Ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.660]   and the positive health effects of the cardiovascular system.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:42.360]   So fidgeting alone can be great,
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.560]   but you need exercise for other reasons.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.360]   Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat that you burn
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.120]   in any duration of exercise,
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.280]   and it can shift the percentage of fat that you oxidize
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.640]   compared to glycogen.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.360]   Unless you take that caffeine and it ramps you up so much
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.600]   that you're training really, really intensely.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.940]   The bottom line is if you like caffeine
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.960]   and you can use it safely,
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.800]   ingesting somewhere between 100 and 400 milligrams of caffeine
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.780]   prior to exercise,
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.720]   somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes before exercise
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.280]   can be beneficial if we're talking about fat oxidation,
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.680]   burning more body fat.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.960]   So that's caffeine.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.640]   There are a number of other things that have existed
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.560]   over the years that are in this pathway.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.560]   Things like ephedrine, which is now illegal in most states,
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:32.320]   I think maybe in all states
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.280]   because people were dropping dead from taking ephedrine
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.380]   because they were heating up too much.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   It's interesting.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.240]   It wasn't direct effects on the heart causing heart attack.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.920]   It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors,
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.360]   if you'd like to know,
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.520]   increases in body temperature and heat.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.840]   Now, those drugs turned out to be dangerous
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.460]   because people were overheating and dying.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.580]   There was also the big fen-fen craze.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.200]   There was a drug that was released, fenfluramine,
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:05.600]   which actually was quite effective as an anti-obesity drug,
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.320]   a treatment for obesity.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.100]   That had to be outlawed as well.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:13.620]   It was, FDA approval was removed
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.180]   because again, people were dying
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.000]   because of cardiovascular effects.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.780]   I don't know if people were overheating on it as well.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.440]   So what is the solution?
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.860]   If caffeine is the kind of the entry point for most people
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.020]   of using compounds to increase the rate
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:31.180]   or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest,
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.340]   what are some of the other things
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:33.940]   that are useful and interesting?
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.500]   Well, in terms of tools that are actionable
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.900]   and have reasonable safety margins,
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.540]   I've talked before about something called GLP-1.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:46.160]   This is something that can be triggered
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.980]   by the ingestion of yerba mate, which is a tea.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:51.220]   And I guess because half Argentine,
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.620]   they grew up drinking mate.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.640]   I think I was drinking mate
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.980]   from the time I was about three or four years old.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.420]   I don't suggest that for kids.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:00.500]   I don't think kids should be ingesting caffeine.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:01.820]   But anyway, I did it.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.900]   And I still ingest mate.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.460]   Mate increases GLP-1.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:10.660]   GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.060]   So let's just quickly return to our biochemistry.
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:16.500]   As you recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.860]   and then it's burned up.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.700]   It's oxidized in cells.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:24.060]   It actually needs to be converted into ATP.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.780]   And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.020]   in the mitochondria of the cell.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:34.780]   High insulin prevents that from happening.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:38.400]   And glucagon facilitates that process.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.460]   Glucagon facilitates that process through increases in GLP-1.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:49.300]   The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.580]   and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you'll burn.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.360]   It increases fat burning.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.820]   And that is especially true,
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:57.940]   it turns out from the scientific literature,
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:02.020]   if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.020]   So if you want to burn more fat,
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:08.180]   drinking mate before exercise is good.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.240]   Drinking it at rest when you're not exercising
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.440]   will also help shift your metabolism toward
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.060]   enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation.
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:21.340]   Now there's a whole category of pharmaceuticals
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.820]   that's being developed right now
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.440]   that are in late stage trials
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.840]   or are in use for the treatment of diabetes,
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.040]   which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.920]   They go by various names
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   and there are people on the internet
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.280]   who are selling these things.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.640]   They are prescription drugs.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.960]   And I want to emphasize that they are prescription drugs
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.940]   and you obviously wouldn't want to use any of these
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.360]   without a prescription and a requirement.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.080]   They, it does seem that they are effective
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.920]   for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.940]   and lead to fairly significant weight loss
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:55.620]   and reduction in appetite.
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:59.580]   So this is kind of the modern version of GLP-1
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.780]   is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:07.260]   are drugs such as somatic...
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.580]   I can never pronounce this.
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:11.080]   Can't seem to pronounce many things it seems.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:14.000]   Semaglutide is the way I would pronounce it.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.800]   S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.320]   Semaglutide, but that's not the way you pronounce it.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.920]   But somatoglide is the way that
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:26.540]   it's been described on the internet.
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:30.480]   In any case, this compound increases GLP-1.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.440]   It's actually a GLP-1 analog in some cases
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.320]   and they go by various types of trade names.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.300]   So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.400]   Most people, including myself,
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.340]   are not interested in taking a prescription drug
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.460]   to increase GLP-1.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.420]   I do it through the ingestion of mate.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.260]   I just get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.360]   What's kind of interesting that's not often discussed
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:57.040]   is that you can increase the amount of GLP-1
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.260]   by, you can essentially reuse the tea.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.800]   The first time you drink it, it's going to be very,
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.640]   very intense.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.480]   In fact, some people find that,
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.980]   mate almost tastes like burnt leaves.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.820]   It's too intense.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.540]   You don't want the water to be too hot.
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:12.480]   But I learned this trick from a friend.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.640]   You can reuse the leaves over and over again,
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.780]   probably for about a day before they go bad.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.080]   And in doing that, you start to extract
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.640]   more and more of the compounds from the mate leaf
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.960]   that increased GLP-1.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:23.800]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.320]   You can kind of get an increased effect.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.480]   So what I'll typically do is make
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.300]   about 16 to 30 ounces and just sip it throughout the day.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.040]   And I do like it before I train.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.800]   Some people who don't like mate might prefer something
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.800]   like guayusa, which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.560]   G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa, which is from Ecuador.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.440]   Despite the USA ending to it, it's from Ecuador.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.560]   And it's a sweeter tasting tea.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.360]   It doesn't have any sweetener in it,
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.140]   but the leaf of the guayusa plant is sweeter
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.500]   than the mate plant.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.000]   I sometimes will mix the two
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.560]   and then make the tea with that.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.320]   There's no mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.660]   These are just tools to increase GLP-1 and fat oxidation.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:14.320]   And again, the semaglutide is the prescription version
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:19.000]   where it's kind of the heavy artillery GLP-1 stimulant.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.080]   And again, should be only explored with a prescription.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.920]   So those are the compounds
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:28.380]   that really increase fat oxidation directly.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.040]   There are going to be a number of things
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.240]   that impact insulin and glucagon
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:37.540]   that are going to shift the body toward more fat burning.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.060]   We talked about a lot of these
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.420]   during the episode on hormones.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:42.260]   We talked about it.
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.440]   We did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.660]   And so for instance, berberine, which comes from a plant
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.720]   or metformin are compounds that are now in kind
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.620]   of growing use for reducing blood glucose.
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:58.520]   They are very potent at reducing blood glucose
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.000]   which will reduce insulin
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.800]   because the job of the hormone insulin
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.520]   is to essentially manage glucose in the bloodstream.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.520]   So there are a huge gallery of compounds
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.160]   that will reduce insulin
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.920]   and thereby can increase fat oxidation.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:16.720]   And that's because, as I mentioned before, fat oxidation,
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.180]   this conversion of fatty acids into ATP in the mitochondria
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.480]   is inhibited by insulin.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.920]   So if you keep insulin low,
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.040]   you're going to increase that process.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.280]   Which brings us full circle back
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.140]   to the issue of diet and nutrition.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:33.980]   There is really solid evidence
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.280]   from the Gardner lab at Stanford and from other labs showing
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.260]   that when you look at different diets,
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.060]   you look at low-fat diets, high-fat diets,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.520]   keto diets, intermittent fasting,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.300]   provided people stick to their particular diet,
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.680]   it doesn't really matter which diet you follow.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.260]   You can still get a caloric deficit
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:55.500]   and you get weight loss.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.720]   Adherence, however, is always an issue.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.580]   And so what I always say is
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.920]   that you want to use the eating plan
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.640]   that is obviously beneficial to your health,
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.200]   but the one that allows you to adhere to whatever it is
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.440]   that the particular nutrition protocol is, right?
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.240]   If you can't stick with something,
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.980]   then it's not very worthwhile.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:19.080]   But from the purely scientific standpoint,
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.920]   there's also an advantage to keeping insulin low.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.260]   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you go
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.660]   to zero carbohydrate.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:28.200]   I've talked before about my preferred way of eating is
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.220]   to go low or no carbohydrate throughout the day
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.760]   for alertness, to get that adrenaline release
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.660]   and the focus that goes with it, et cetera,
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.540]   and the ability to think and move
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.400]   and do all the things I need to do during the day.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.860]   And then I eat carbohydrates at night
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.720]   'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.780]   That's what works for me.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:48.780]   But when insulin is low, you do place your system
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:52.080]   in a position to oxidize more fat.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.720]   And so that's why I think a lot of people do see benefit
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:57.900]   from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.400]   because when insulin is low,
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.260]   you are in a position to oxidize more fat,
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.640]   both from exercise and at rest.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.400]   And I should mention because I often mention
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.640]   and it's appropriate to mention that if you're interested
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.360]   in looking at the effects of caffeine,
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:15.320]   of mate, guayusa, things of that sort, GLP-1,
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.960]   you want to learn more about those,
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.720]   you can go to this wonderful website,
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.320]   which is free, examine.com.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.780]   You can put in Yerba Mate.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.120]   It will describe the three studies
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.440]   that show increased fat oxidation,
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.780]   both during exercise and at rest.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:33.760]   And as a consequence, not surprisingly,
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.120]   an increase in metabolic rate.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:38.920]   One thing that's interesting about mate
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.800]   is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.640]   for reasons that still escape me.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.860]   There's a single study showing that heart rate
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.560]   is slightly reduced, which is kind of nice
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.280]   because if when I drink too much caffeine,
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.240]   my heart rate goes up,
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.680]   maybe that would increase my fidgeting and my fat burning,
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:58.120]   but I don't like the feeling of having my basal heart rate
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.260]   being up too high.
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:01.200]   I like my heart rate elevated during exercise,
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.280]   but not when I'm just kind of resting or working
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.400]   and throughout the day.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.860]   And for some reason that I don't understand,
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:11.800]   there's an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation,
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.520]   but reducing heart rate just slightly.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.760]   So that's interesting and it probably lends itself
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.200]   to my, explains the subjective experience that I've had
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.440]   of that mate is kind of a nice, even, mellow stimulant.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.440]   It's not this really supercharged stimulant like caffeine
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.160]   from coffee or other sources.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.600]   Although if you drink too much mate,
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.840]   it will also make you jittery.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.340]   And there's one more compound
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:36.600]   that I think we should discuss
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.920]   in terms of increasing fat loss,
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.720]   and that's carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.180]   They lie in the same pathway.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.600]   We can return to our basic knowledge now
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.720]   of fat mobilization and oxidation.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.240]   After fat is mobilized and makes it into cells
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.680]   and needs to be oxidized,
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.600]   so literally the burning of fat
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.420]   and conversion of it into energy,
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:04.560]   that is accomplished and is facilitated
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:08.440]   by the presence of glucagon being elevated.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.440]   GLP increases that process and insulin being low.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.080]   And we talked about some ways to manage insulin,
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.400]   both in this episode and in previous episode.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.200]   L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine in particular
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.360]   facilitates fat oxidation.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.000]   It helps convert fatty acids into ATP.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.880]   And indeed, supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.960]   That's been shown.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.520]   At what dosages?
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.960]   Well, people ingest anywhere from 500 milligrams
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:47.920]   to two grams per day in divided doses typically.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:49.600]   Some people who are really extreme
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.640]   are taking injectable L-carnitine.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.180]   I've certainly not tried that.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:58.020]   I confess I have used it in pill form from time to time,
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.120]   but in part because of the fat oxidation effects,
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.360]   but also because of the other effects that it tends to have.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:07.680]   So in exploring the effects that L-carnitine has,
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.160]   it has a huge variety of effects on cellular metabolism.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.960]   It can reduce ammonia in the blood.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.980]   That is actually a quite strong effect.
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.040]   It can reduce things like C-reactive protein,
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.120]   which is you want C-reactive protein levels to be managed.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.400]   You do not want them too high.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.320]   Can slightly reduce blood glucose.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.680]   It can slightly increase HDLC,
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.440]   the good form of the blood lipid,
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.960]   and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.160]   And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.120]   the pathway involving glucagon
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:41.840]   such that you get a considerable effect,
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.020]   not a huge effect on fat oxidation.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.680]   So it can improve that oxidation rates.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.040]   It has a number of other effects,
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.600]   some of which I talked about during the month on hormones
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.720]   and that sort of thing.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.080]   It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.160]   and sperm quality.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.440]   So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.040]   in lots of different cells.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.980]   It's impacting sperm motility.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:07.040]   There are a large number of studies supporting that.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.520]   Slight reductions in blood pressure.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:13.040]   N has these interesting effects on reducing fatigue
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.640]   during exercise, reducing inflammatory markers
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.000]   like interleukin-6.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.820]   So it has a number of effects that on the whole
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.600]   are quote unquote positive,
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.160]   or at least in the direction of things that you may want.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.480]   And I should emphasize may.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.700]   You certainly don't need acetyl-L-carnitine
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.160]   in order to lose fat.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.240]   But now that you understand the cellular process
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.000]   by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.960]   it should make sense that if L-carnitine is important
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.680]   for converting fatty acids into energy,
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.880]   then supplementing L-carnitine makes sense.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.520]   Acetyl-L-carnitine is the type of L-carnitine
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.400]   or the form of L-carnitine, I should say,
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.620]   that is transported and utilized most easily by the body.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.200]   And so that's why sometimes we distinguish
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.160]   between L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:05.560]   So once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.540]   We've talked about the science of fat loss.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:11.680]   And in particular, we've explored this topic
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.440]   from the perspective of the nervous system,
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.520]   how neurons, and in particular,
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.280]   the release of things like adrenaline, epinephrine,
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.340]   can facilitate fat mobilization and oxidation.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:27.040]   We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:30.640]   this non-exercise type movement
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.600]   that can greatly increase caloric burn and why that is.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:36.720]   We talked about shiver,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.680]   another form of non-exercise movement
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.800]   that can really increase both caloric expenditure
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.760]   due to the shiver, due to the movement,
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.360]   as well as increased thermogenesis,
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.240]   the heating up of the body through things like brown fat,
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.320]   and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat,
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.880]   which is a good thing if you want to oxidize fat.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.480]   We talked about cold as a particular stimulus
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:04.480]   to induce shiver and how to use getting into and out of cold
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.380]   as a way to stimulate shiver and avoid cold adaptation
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.560]   so that you continue to oxidize and burn fat,
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:13.840]   if that's your goal.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.520]   If you want to check out the protocols for that,
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:19.080]   they're at thecoldplunge.com.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.420]   And in weeks to come,
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.220]   we're going to be adding more protocols to that website,
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.720]   not just for fat loss, but for things like resilience,
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.560]   reducing inflammation, et cetera.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.720]   So be sure to check those out.
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.020]   Again, those are totally cost-free.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:33.860]   Talked about exercise,
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:36.240]   how rather than thinking about cardiovascular
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.100]   or weight training exercise,
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.720]   that we should perhaps look through the lens
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.920]   of this adrenaline system
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.340]   and how it interacts with fat stores,
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:48.000]   and think about low, medium, or high intensity exercise,
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.960]   whether or not we show up to that fasted or not.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.220]   Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.880]   if you start with high intensity movements
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.480]   and then move into lower intensity type exercise.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.240]   If you're going to go long duration,
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.500]   it probably doesn't matter
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.360]   unless you're exercising longer than 90 minutes,
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.860]   whether or not you eat or not.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:11.980]   We talked about caffeine as a stimulant
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:16.320]   and a stimulus for epinephrine and adrenaline release
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:19.960]   as a way to access more fat metabolism.
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.760]   And we talked about compounds
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.880]   that come from things like yerba mate and guayusa tea,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.840]   this GLP-1 pathway that can trigger increased fat oxidation,
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.920]   so much so that the pharmaceutical companies
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.760]   are now developing compounds specifically to increase GLP-1
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.320]   for treatment of diabetes and obesity.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.820]   But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.840]   through the ingestion of things like mate or guayusa
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.000]   if that's of interest to you.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.880]   And then we talked about L-carnitine
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.800]   and how L-carnitine itself is critical
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.180]   for the fat oxidation within individual cells,
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:57.000]   the conversion of fatty acids to energy
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.320]   and why having your insulin low
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.500]   and things like L-carnitine and glucagon levels
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.960]   high or sufficient at least
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:10.560]   to can facilitate the burning of fat, fat oxidation.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:11.760]   So we covered a lot of material.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.360]   That's a lot of protocols.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.380]   I realize, and the little list I just gave right there
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:19.080]   didn't even begin to get into all the details
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.840]   and corners that we discussed.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.760]   I hope you found this conversation interesting
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.160]   both for sake of understanding fat loss
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.040]   and how to lose fat more quickly
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.800]   and to lose more of it if that's your goal,
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.200]   as well as simply to understand the biology
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200]   of fat metabolism from a different perspective,
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.920]   from the perspective of the nervous system.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.400]   If you're enjoying this podcast

[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.200]   It takes me some time.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.420]   I sometimes fall a little bit behind
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:33.800]   depending on other duties, but I read all the comments
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.600]   and I do take them into account

[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.480]   I've mentioned supplements during the podcast.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.860]   If you're interested in taking supplements,
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:08.640]   you might want to check out Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:09.860]   We've partnered with Thorne
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:12.360]   because they have the highest levels of stringency
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.200]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients they use
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.360]   and the amounts of the ingredients that they use.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.980]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:24.980]   you can go to thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman.
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:29.380]   And you can get 20% off any of the supplements
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:31.880]   that are there, as well as any of the supplements
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.760]   that Thorne makes.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.760]   That's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u, the letter U,
