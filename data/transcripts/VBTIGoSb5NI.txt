[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620]   All right.
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.020]   Let's move on now.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.980]   We have time for two more questions.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.020]   Okay, let's get another question.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.860]   I think we have time.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.680]   Who do we have here?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.120]   - All right, next question we have,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.920]   it's basically about the deep life during the pandemic
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.180]   and he's a student.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.140]   So he's got some good questions.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.220]   He's got a good question for you.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.260]   - There's a pandemic?
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.660]   That's the first I'm hearing of this.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.680]   - I'm local.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.240]   I'm a long time listener of your podcast.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.480]   I'm a college student.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.560]   Last year when the pandemic hits, I moved back to my home.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.000]   Throughout the pandemic, my life become way more structured.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.880]   I took your 30 day social media challenge,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.940]   removed social media completely
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.040]   from my life after that challenge.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.600]   I really started to enjoy deep life,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.040]   but now colleges are opening back again
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   and I moved back to the university.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.880]   The structure which I implemented in my life
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.320]   during the pandemic is completely stressed away.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   I tried time blocking to add the structure again,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.320]   but my classes are not properly scheduled
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920]   and most of the time they are random.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.880]   This left me small chunks of time,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.480]   but I cannot figure out a way to use those small chunks
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   and mostly waste that time on YouTube.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   This led to me a burnout feeling throughout the day.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.600]   These days I'm mostly stressed out
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.760]   and just looking forward to the weekend.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.000]   I really want to add the structure in my life again
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.100]   and enjoy this deep life.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.040]   Any suggestions how can I implement
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   the structure back again to my life?
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   - Well, your old structure is not gonna work,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120]   but you're gonna build a new structure that does.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.120]   So yes, whatever deep life structure that was working
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.660]   when you were at home, it's not gonna work at school,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.720]   but there is plenty of options for deep life structures
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.400]   at school that will work.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.720]   So I have a few pieces of advice for you.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.840]   Number one, I want you to autopilot schedule
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600]   the hell out of your schedule.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.960]   So autopilot scheduling was invented originally
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.160]   for college students and the idea is you look at each one
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.920]   of your classes and you identify what is work
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.040]   that has to get done every single week
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160]   or every single month, what sort of work happens regularly
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760]   for these classes, problem sets that have to be solved,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.700]   reading assignments that have to happen,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.380]   essay prompts that have to be written,
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.300]   and you say, when and where do I do that work every week?
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.620]   And that goes on your calendar like a dentist appointment
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.060]   or another class, it's in time that you are not
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.020]   gonna violate, this is just when I do that work.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.620]   And you do that for all of your classes
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.720]   and now you can move these around like a puzzle piece
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.980]   and figure out what's a pretty good sustainable schedule
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.180]   for my work and more importantly, you're not asking
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.940]   every day what should I do and when,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580]   that's all figured out.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.020]   All right, so you're gonna autopilot schedule
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.540]   and then you are gonna upgrade your study skills
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.240]   so that you're not wasting time by spinning your wheels
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.280]   with inefficient study habits, I don't want you
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.120]   spending more time than you need to.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.720]   So go back and read How to Become a Straight A Student,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.840]   walk through that advice to completely overhaul
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.520]   your study habits, the other thing you can do
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.200]   is go to my blog, calnewport.com/blog
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   and read the first two years worth of posts, 2007, 2008,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.440]   it's all advanced study advice for college students.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.900]   I want you to reduce the wasted time doing your schoolwork.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.320]   So that's step one, now let's say you've done that
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.600]   and you still have no time, you say I figured out
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.240]   autopilot schedule, prom sets, reading assignments, prompts
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   and my whole calendar is filled up and I still,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.400]   and I have no time left except for the weekends,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.800]   all right, step two, under schedule,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.520]   drop stuff off your schedule, drop some classes,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.120]   simplify your load, even if you're going under the load
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   you need probably to graduate, do it for a semester or two
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.200]   as you're trying to get back on your feet
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.920]   after the pandemic, whatever you do, do not try
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.080]   to super overload your schedule, you need to step away
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.440]   from the mindset that the job market
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.200]   or the graduate school market a couple of years
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.520]   down the line is gonna say, look at how hard
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.580]   Mookle's semester was in the spring of 2022,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.360]   that's a really hard semester, we really like them,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.560]   they don't look at that, no one cares,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.920]   they're like, what's your major, what are your grades?
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.600]   So simplify your schedule, under schedule,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   cut things out of your schedule
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   until your autopilot schedule fits with plenty of room,
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   that means dropping classes, dropping activities,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.220]   swapping classes for easier classes,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.960]   you need breathing room, so if you're autopiloting
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.780]   with smart schedules and you're properly under scheduled,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.640]   you're gonna find yourself now with some breathing room
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.620]   which is what you absolutely need,
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.320]   now I want you to reinvent your leisure time
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.240]   and get involved in some sort of high quality
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.200]   leisure activity, preferably involving other human beings,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.520]   they're also on the college campus,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.080]   something that you can really get into,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.640]   it could be exercise related, it could be writing related
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   or theatrical, artistic related,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   but something you can really get into
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   for no other reason than you like it,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.520]   that other people are involved in
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.480]   and that can really start to funnel your energy
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.200]   away from YouTube, the only YouTube I want in your life
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   is looking at my channel so you can watch my videos
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.800]   and I don't mean to be strict about this,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.520]   but I only want you doing that for,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.720]   let's say three hours a day,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.520]   no more than that, three hours a day watching my videos,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.640]   maybe another two hours trying to convince people
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   you know to subscribe, but that five hours
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.760]   is the only five hours I want you spending on YouTube.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.140]   The final thing I'm gonna recommend, thing number four,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.480]   I want you to Google, I don't have the link
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.940]   off the top of my head, but there's a series I did
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.480]   on my blog back when I was aimed at students
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.160]   called the Romantic Scholar, and so you can just Google
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.040]   calnewport.com romantic scholar,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.440]   and it was a series about how do you reconstruct
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.400]   your college lifestyle so that you have
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.880]   an intrinsically motivated deep interest
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.400]   in the work you're doing as a student.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.840]   How can you rewire your relationship to your schoolwork
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.240]   so it's not this thing that's intrinsically being imposed
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   upon you that's causing stress and burnout,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.520]   but instead something that's a deep part
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.800]   of your self-definition and a real source
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.380]   of interest and motivation, and it has a lot of advice
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.400]   about how you do that, and I want you to read that series
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   and put that into action.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.480]   This is a hard transition for a lot of students.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.240]   The pandemic was incredibly disruptive.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   Coming back to school after the pandemic
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.920]   is really disruptive.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.360]   It's not just let's load up our schedule
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   and get after it and do 17 majors and just grind it,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.440]   and something good will happen.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   We have to take this transition with care.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.280]   I like that you're thinking about using this transition
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.080]   as a way to preserve depth in your life.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.240]   That's my advice to do it.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.320]   So here's a quick summary.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.720]   Autopilot schedule plus smarter study habits.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.120]   If you're still overloaded, underschedule.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   Quit, reduce course load, switch to easier courses.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.160]   Once you've done that, get involved
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.760]   in a deep leisure activity that involves other human beings,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.120]   and four, read my Romantic Scholar series on my blog
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.200]   and take those ideas to heart.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.120]   You do that plus five quick hours
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.480]   of working on my YouTube channel every day,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.560]   those two things I think we're all gonna be
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.960]   much better off.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.540]   (upbeat music)
