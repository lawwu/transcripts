[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140]   The comforts and the wealth of our Western world
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.360]   can be a blessing,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.320]   and they can become a deadly curse to us as well.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.060]   So how can we be freed from the clutches
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.220]   of Western materialism?
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460]   It's a question Pastor John took up in a sermon
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.740]   27 years ago on Hebrews 10,
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.320]   a chapter with an incredible text in verse 34,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.540]   which says, "You joyfully accepted
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.100]   "the plundering of your property
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.140]   "since you knew that you yourselves
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.940]   "had a better possession and an abiding one."
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.140]   Amazing text.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.740]   Hebrews 10, 34, it's a text with a key lesson
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.460]   relevant to all of us today
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.060]   who live in the Disneyland of Western affluence.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.020]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.060]   - The Christian church in America suffers
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.060]   from about 350 years of dominance and prosperity.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.620]   What I mean by dominance is that
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500]   for almost all of this country's history
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.860]   from the Puritans on,
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.100]   the Christian ethos has been the dominant one,
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.980]   and to be a Christian is to be a person
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.980]   who's accepted and viewed as normal,
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.140]   and even one who has some traits
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.980]   that are beneficial to the country.
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.780]   What I mean by prosperity is that
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.040]   being a Christian and fitting in to that ethos
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.040]   has for a long time resulted in things going well for us.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.200]   And so to be a Christian has been a plus.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.720]   And what I mean by the church suffering from that,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.160]   suffering from this dominance
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.480]   and suffering from this prosperity,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   is that this has resulted in a massively ingrained
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.380]   and unbiblical mindset.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.700]   If you act like a Christian,
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.460]   you will probably work hard and be thrifty
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.980]   and probably will succeed in business,
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.940]   and that's better for you.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.000]   If you act like a Christian,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.860]   you'll probably be kind and generous,
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.080]   and at least then a few people will think well of you,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.960]   and that'll be better for you.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.380]   So we can all say, "Well, what's wrong with that?
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.960]   "What's wrong with things going better for you?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.820]   "Why do you say it's a suffering
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.240]   "that has come upon the church
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800]   "that we have grown to feel that this is the way it is,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400]   "this is the way it should be,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   "and we're at home here, things go better with Christ."
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.460]   The problem is that we have gotten things
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.360]   so out of proportion that we can't really even imagine
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   what the New Testament church was like, I think.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.000]   The little simple spin-offs out here
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.120]   at the edge of Christianity,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.200]   and we've made them the cherished treasure of the middle,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.280]   and we've elevated them to the point where,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.200]   well, if things don't go better for us,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.400]   then what's the use of being a Christian?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.040]   And therefore, it becomes almost impossible for us
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.240]   to imagine what happened in this text.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.840]   What it was like to be a Christian
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440]   when there was no Christian America,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.120]   no ethos built up over 300 years
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.800]   of Puritan Protestant work ethic.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.180]   This text, Hebrews 10, 32 to 36, fills me.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.360]   Every time I go back to it, and it's one of my favorites,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.200]   it just fills me with a longing to be set free
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.560]   from domesticated, comfort-seeking,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   entertainment-addicted American Christianity.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   I just want to be so free.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   And this text, when you read it,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.400]   mm, it just makes chills run up and down your back,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.640]   saying, "Now that is authenticity.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.880]   "If I could be like that, I'd be real."
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.680]   And everybody wants to be real.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   Nobody wants to be phony.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.640]   Nobody wants to just have a little glaze of Christianity
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.600]   over an ordinary secular life,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.040]   pursuing the same goals that everybody pursues
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   who doesn't believe.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.920]   Verse 34b, I've said it, let's read it again.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.080]   "You accepted joyfully the seizure of your property."
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.440]   How?
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   Where did that come from?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   Here's the next phrase.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.320]   "Knowing that you have for yourselves
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.880]   "a better possession and an abiding one.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.960]   "Therefore, don't throw away your confidence
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.240]   "or your boldness, which has great reward."
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   Now right there, I think I see the key, or a key,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.320]   to the anemic nature of the American church.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.680]   My analysis is that one of the reasons is,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.360]   and I think it's one of the main ones,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.680]   is that we are at home in Disneyland.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.800]   This is Disneyland.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   This room is Disneyland.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   This suit is Disneyland.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.680]   This electronic device here is Disneyland.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   The cars you came in are Disneyland.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.120]   The meals you will eat and buy today
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.280]   at who knows what per shot will be Disneyland.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.440]   We live in Disneyland compared to where everybody else lives.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.920]   Almost everybody.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.200]   There are few other Disneylands in Western Europe.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.160]   And we're at home.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.440]   We're addicted.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.920]   We don't even know we live in Disneyland.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   We use words like "me," "me,"
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.200]   for the most ridiculous accessories.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.640]   We do.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.560]   And I'm not about to tell you
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.080]   which ones you must get rid of.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.840]   We've been through this before as a church.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.160]   When I wrote the chapter on money and desiring God,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.320]   and we talked about the house at the lake.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.520]   The lake.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.680]   It's that spot in Minnesota where all these houses are.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.680]   And I didn't say you couldn't have one.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.120]   But if you're at home,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.640]   if you're at home in this Disneyland,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.720]   so that if they burned down that house,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.920]   or they smashed your car,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.400]   or they took all your heirlooms,
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.840]   or they fired you from your job,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.480]   there would be this rip.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.440]   The reason the American church is weak
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.000]   is because we're at home in this Disneyland.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.040]   Now I think it's always gonna be a Disneyland, okay?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.520]   'Til Jesus comes.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.800]   But you know why God has created this Disneyland?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.640]   For missions.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.760]   And for the poor.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.720]   Paul said,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.760]   we have nothing,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.240]   and yet we possess everything.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.800]   If you believe that,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.320]   that will make you free.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680]   Free.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.200]   Free.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.680]   - Amen, true freedom.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   Indeed, freedom from the enslavement
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.760]   to the comforts and wealth of this world.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.200]   That clip was taken from a 27-year-old sermon
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   preached on May 9th, 1993.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.840]   The sermon is titled,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.880]   "You Joyfully Accepted the Plundering of Your Property."
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.760]   And you can find the entire recording at desiringgod.org.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.720]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.880]   And speaking of freedom,
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.760]   we are citizens of our countries.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.720]   And this week here in the States,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.440]   we celebrate Independence Day.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.760]   We want to reject the clutches of material comforts,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.120]   and yet we can also voice our patriotism
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.200]   and our love for our fatherland too.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.240]   We can do both of those things.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.160]   And with July 4th here in a few days,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.640]   we can begin to ask the important question,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.320]   how much patriotism is too much patriotism?
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   That's the question on the table
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.920]   when we return on Friday with Pastor John.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.880]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
