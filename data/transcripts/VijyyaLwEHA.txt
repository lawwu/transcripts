[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.800]   I think the basic question that we're going to be asked on this effort is, we already
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.320]   have maybe as many as 25 English translations that are in circulation.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.560]   Why do we need another English translation of the Bible?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   Why have we taken on this project?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.040]   And how urgent is it to have another one?
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780]   I think fundamentally one of the things we wanted to do with this translation wasn't
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.240]   to produce something new in a brand new sense, but to preserve something old.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.560]   A lot of what we did in the Legacy Standard Bible was to uphold what we already have in
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   the 95 to make sure that that translation remains extant in the next generations.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.860]   And it also pulled from the 1977, which has kind of gone away a little bit, not necessarily
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.240]   in popularity, but in availability.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.520]   So we wanted to bring some of those things together and preserve it.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.200]   So it's not just about getting something new to the people, but having them tie with what
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   they've always had and having their children tie with what they've had.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680]   On top of that, and I think the rest of you all can kind of speak to this, one of the
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.380]   goals that we wanted to advance was the idea of consistency.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.680]   Any of you all want to talk about that kind of notion in translation?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.160]   But backing up a little bit, preserving a translation, and in this case the NAS, New
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.520]   American Standard 95, collectively we felt that that was the best of the current English
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   translations.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   We all felt that way.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.000]   But we could see trends that were going to replace that in the future, and we wanted
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.680]   to rescue it while we had the time.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.280]   So if you're working with an existing translation, are you working with the English, or did you
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.840]   take it all the way back to the Hebrew and the Greek?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   - Yeah.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   Why don't we have these guys answer for us here?
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   - Well, in the Old Testament, we absolutely went to the Hebrew and just going word by
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   word from the very beginning.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.760]   We started with the New Testament, of course, and then the Psalms and the Proverbs, that
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.800]   was the first part that we did.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.180]   And when we were doing the Hebrew, we just went word by word, verse by verse, all the
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.240]   way through, looking at every single translation that NASB had, the New American Standard Bible
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.920]   had, and where the translation was good and we affirmed it, which was the majority of
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.480]   the cases, of course, then we retained it.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.980]   And where there needed to be some refinement or some kind of an adjustment, that's where
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.920]   we adjusted the text, and I think other men can speak to the New Testament.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   - Yeah.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   Dr. Varner, how did you kind of go through the Greek?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.640]   - So I looked at the Greek, and I looked at what's available in the English language,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.960]   and what are the best words to convey what's in the Greek?
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   That's not rocket science.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   That's what we all ought to have been doing all along.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   But the more the emphasis got on readability, if you don't mind my saying, I've always viewed
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.600]   the history of English translations as moving from elegance with the King James down to
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.880]   the 1881 British Revised Version, then the emphasis on accuracy from the British Revised
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.480]   Version to the NASB in 1977, and since then, the emphasis is on readability.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.200]   And I think we're trying to make an effort, okay, it still needs to be readable, but we
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.520]   need to get back in that second movement of accuracy.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.100]   We don't want to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of readability.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.040]   And I think that's what's driven me in translating the New Testament.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.000]   - And one of the things with that, I think we were trying to be consistent.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.800]   I think the word has already been mentioned, and an example of that is in John.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   So as much as possible across books of the New Testament and within the New Testament
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.240]   itself, we wanted to translate the same word, if at all possible, within the context with
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.940]   the same word across the board.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.680]   So in John 19, 28 through verse 30, we know the famous verse, "It is finished," and the
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.000]   word "finished," but it appears twice before verse 30, where it says, "Scripture was fulfilled
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.280]   in the Nazbe, it said that, and we took it back to finished," because it's the same root.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.520]   And all the things that Jesus had done were finished, and we took it back to finished.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.080]   So now you have three words that are the same in the Greek, translated as finished, as opposed
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.880]   to three different ways.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.840]   And that kind of consistency helps the preacher, but of course the reader, to see that there's
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   the same vocabulary behind the scenes that the author's trying to convey.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.320]   And I think that's where the accuracy comes into picture, as Dr. Varner just described,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   this consistency was a big factor.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.640]   So you generally felt that the NAS was what you thought it was, a sound, reliable translation,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:25.240]   and tightening it up in some places to make it more precise, using the same translation
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   of the same word so that people can connect the dots, were things that would make it better.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.720]   And then maybe occasionally, you were thinking about the communication side of it.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.080]   Would that be fair to some?
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   - Yeah.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   - Sorry.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   - No, go ahead.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.240]   - So one of the principles that we kept coming back to was, if it's not broken, don't fix
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   it.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.480]   And that goes to what Abner was saying, we were trying to preserve what is already a
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   very good translation, where there was room for improvement, changes were made, and often
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.880]   that came about through drawing out consistency in the use of a word.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.760]   And I really appreciate that, because I think it helps with the holistic grasp of what's
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.480]   going on throughout the Scriptures, and just showing the English Bible reader how interwoven
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   the Scriptures are.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.160]   - And I think from the very beginning, that's what we talked about, is that since the Bible
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.120]   is its own best interpreter, right, since Scripture interprets Scripture, you help the
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.560]   student if the connections are more visible by using the same word, even connecting the
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   New Testament passages with themselves.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   So and that would be, what, say, percent of the effort that you did would be that kind
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   of connection?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   - Substantial.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   - Substantial.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   - Substantial, yeah.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.680]   - So that would have been a major effort in getting the NAS to where it needed to be was
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.000]   in using consistent translations of similar or the same words, so you connected all those
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   things together.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   - And even across Testaments.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.600]   So for example, seed, you know, it appears in various English forms, but we used seed
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.960]   across the New and the Old Testament to make sure the New Testament reader can connect
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   it back to the promise of the seed in the Old Testament.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   - And that was very crucial so that we can understand that this is one book, there's
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.640]   one flow, and that the New Testament is picking up on the Old Testament, and you can see that
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.520]   in the English because the same kind of vocabulary is used, even something as simple as "now
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   it happened," and making sure that the way the New Testament translates that kind of
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.240]   phraseology is the way the Old Testament translates that phraseology, so you have the understanding,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.880]   "Hey, this is one book," yes, with many authors, one divine author, but one book, and it flows
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   and it fits together.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.500]   - And it would seem to me, since we are utterly and totally committed to God being the divine
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:08.480]   author of every part of Scripture, that this is a way to honor the single author.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.320]   So that there's clarity that in many cases wouldn't exist if you didn't do that.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.320]   - Yeah.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   No, that's right.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   - And I would just say one thing.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.840]   When it was difficult to make a decision like that, consistency, accuracy, clarity, we left
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.040]   it as is, in thinking that the preacher is responsible to explain the text to the audience,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.640]   as opposed to us as translators being responsible for the interpretation element.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.240]   So I think we all hold each other accountable to that line, that we're not going to become
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.880]   interpreters but translators.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:48.920]   - Yeah, and I think that is a definitive characteristic of this effort, that it is not an interpretation
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.600]   of the Scripture.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.120]   It is the Scripture.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   - Yeah, that's what we're trying to deliver to the student of the Bible, to the believer,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.480]   to the discipler, to the teacher, to the pastor, what the Bible says, and leave the decision
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.200]   of what it means and what stems from that to them.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.080]   - So you wanted to give them in English what would be the closest thing to the original
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.240]   source as you could get.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   - That's right.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   And that's actually the genius, I think, of the New American Standard originally, was
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.860]   that they put things in italics to tell you this wasn't part of the original text.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.520]   They put things in footnotes, whether that be extensive cross-references or translator
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.480]   notes to help explain what was going on behind the scenes in the text.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.800]   There's a lot of resources that are packed into just one translation.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.500]   It's a valuable tool, and that goes back to why we wanted to uphold it and why it was
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.240]   so wonderful to use.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:57.040]   - It might be interesting for people to know that the two, I think, dominant translators
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:06.800]   on the original NAS77 were my teachers, Dr. Thomas and Dr. Feinberg.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.240]   And if ever there lived an originalist, those two guys were originalists, and you all, you
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.080]   know Dr. Thomas, you didn't know Dr. Feinberg.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:24.520]   But they had a lockdown mentality on the scripture, finding the scripture in its most accurate
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.600]   original sense.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.200]   So the goal that you had in mind was to stay true to the original text, to make connections
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.560]   that might not have been visible in the past because the words were changed in English
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.680]   when they could have gone back to the same word and that would have made those ties clear.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.920]   And occasionally you updated maybe the language a little bit, but I don't think you did a
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:56.760]   lot with, say, archaic language, because there wasn't a lot of archaic language in the NAS95.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.880]   Most of it was taken out between '77 and '95, is that not correct?
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   - Yeah.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.360]   - So the these and those.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   - Yeah.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   So you weren't working with those.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   - No.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.240]   - Well, that's incredible.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.640]   You did have an appreciation for the NAS and the work that was done.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   - Yeah.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.160]   - There are many times Joe and I would talk after translating one of our sessions, how
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.280]   much we respect the NAS even more.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.880]   We heard you say many times it is the most literal translation there is.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.600]   And you know, growing up in this church, you hear that often, but now having been part
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.080]   of this project, it was reaffirmed by experience and through translation.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   Go ahead, Joe.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.320]   - And this literal commitment to the original languages expresses itself in the word choice,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.600]   but also in the word order.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.280]   And then we were just talking before we started this, it spills over even into the punctuation.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.320]   And this commitment to the order of the punctuation is apparent both in the Old Testament and
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   in the New Testament.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.040]   So you can see it across the board that they were really committed to getting it exactly
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.640]   as the original languages had it.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.000]   - And sometimes, and it's not just that you have all this commitment across, the way they
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   did it had reasons.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.880]   And sometimes you couldn't figure that out at first, or sometimes I would write in my
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.200]   notes, "I think we can change this.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.960]   I think we can increase the accuracy here.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.760]   I think we can reorder it."
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.240]   And then a verse later, I'd say, "Nope, doesn't work.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   And we could do it this way.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   We could do it this way.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   We could do this way."
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.440]   Or we could just actually have it as is because that's actually the right way to do it, and
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.320]   we have no other choice.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.200]   And we're kind of reinventing the wheel.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.600]   But in reinventing the wheel in that sense, we realized they did a fantastic job.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.040]   They really did a fantastic job.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.440]   - Go ahead, Paul.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.480]   - One of the implications that spills out of that that I wasn't anticipating, but it
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.880]   just kept impressing itself upon me is how much our reading and our interpretation of
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.920]   the Bible is to be in the local church.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.160]   So there were so many times when we wanted to go beyond essentially what was there literally
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.000]   because it would make it that much clearer.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.520]   - You wanted to help the preacher.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.280]   - You want to help the reader, but we're not the one explaining.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.400]   We're there as translators.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.280]   So we're bound by what the text says.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.680]   And then as we've already mentioned today in our discussions, time and time again, we'd
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.360]   say we trust that the preacher is going to explain.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.860]   - So you had to exercise some restraint because you are all preachers.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.800]   And the inclination is add an explanatory comment, but we're translators in this project.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.880]   - So you were stifling one gift to make the most of it.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.240]   - But it really does emphasize the importance of the local church in the act of reading
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.200]   and understanding the Bible and the role of the preacher, the responsibility that he has.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.080]   - Well, that went down all the way to the footnote level.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   We wanted to minimize footnotes.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   So that was the next question.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   - Sure.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.320]   - So how frequently did you put a footnote in?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.020]   How often did you kind of face that challenge?
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.960]   - I think one of the things that we right off the bat were looking to do is to reduce
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   footnotes.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.260]   And that was always the kind of the go-to.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.320]   Can we reduce, can we make this, take the footnote and actually stick it up into the
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   text?
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.620]   And there were times that we had to maybe add a footnote or change one.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.260]   But I think that was at least our goal is to make it less footnote oriented.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:26.540]   But there were footnotes that we did add because of the uniqueness of the translation decisions
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.820]   we made.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:33.620]   Some of the footnotes point out a wordplay that we couldn't articulate in the text without
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.140]   difficulty.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:42.520]   And so you'll see literally this word cross-reference another passage, and that helps the reader
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.700]   to know, oh, there's a connection there.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.740]   There's a correlation there.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.780]   Another one, which I think was a very wise move since we did do Yahweh in the Old Testament.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.680]   But what do you do with the word Lord in the New Testament?
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.940]   What we did is we put a footnote there every time it was translating the word Yahweh so
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.100]   that the reader can say, yes, the Greek is translating it Lord.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.500]   And it should be that way because that's what our Greek New Testament says.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.820]   That's what they wrote originally under the inspiration of the Spirit.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.580]   But it's also going back to the Old Testament and saying Yahweh.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.180]   And I think that really helps even to anchor and amplify the deity of Christ because so
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.780]   many passages using Kyrios, Lord, refer to Him.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.660]   Use Yahweh in the Old Testament.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.700]   That's a connection that most people would miss.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:40.980]   So there's not an overt effort to give alternative translations.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.020]   That's a disturbing trend in some newer translations where you get the feeling that the translators
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.940]   couldn't make up their mind or there wasn't enough information to make a decision.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.420]   And when too many alternate translations are put in the margin, people lose confidence
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.620]   in what they're reading.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.940]   So you fought those battles so that you didn't have to do that very often.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.780]   You helped us fight those battles because whenever we had a question, we couldn't solve
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.780]   it.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.540]   We just said, "Well, let me talk to Dr. MacArthur."
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.300]   Were you leaning on my authority or my scholarship?
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.620]   We were leaning on your years of wisdom.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.300]   And in all seriousness, that's the truth.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:29.140]   I think I appreciated Dr. MacArthur so much that every time we would talk, you would insist
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.200]   what is the right thing to do.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.860]   Not what is expedient, not what is comfortable, but what is right.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.340]   And you kept bringing us back to that.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.500]   And I think that provided clarity for a lot of our discussions.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.180]   What makes sense, and not just in that one paragraph, but in the whole book.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.140]   So an example I'm thinking of is we had a hard time deciding on maturity versus perfection
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.620]   in the book of Hebrews.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.380]   And after going around for probably almost an hour, we finally said, "Okay, we have to
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.180]   go to Pastor John and see what he thinks."
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.740]   And you stepped in and helped us navigate that, but ultimately make the decision.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.780]   Perfection was the right word, which is also in the NASB, but it's still in the LSB.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:12.360]   Yeah, and just in the case of Hebrews, that's a very important word because one of my first
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.460]   courses in seminary was from Dr. Feinberg, and he pounded that term into us as to its
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.720]   meaning in the book of Hebrews.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.980]   So you called me on the right question.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.780]   You know, occasionally we would move what was in a footnote in the NASB to the text
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.080]   and switch what was in the text into a footnote.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.220]   We didn't do that a lot, but we did it occasionally.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:42.580]   I think of one time that I really had to have a little conversation with Dr. MacArthur twice.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.340]   The name for Peter is not Simon, it's Simeon.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.260]   You know, it's in 2 Peter 1.1 and also in Acts 15.14.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.560]   And I thought that we should, like, bring that out.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.740]   It's a little more Hebraic, Simeon, than Simon.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.820]   It reflects the Shemaon a little bit better.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.980]   And yet the NASB had Simon even in those two places.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:16.380]   James refers to him as Simeon in Acts 15.14, but then he refers to himself as Simeon in
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.380]   2 Peter 1.1.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.580]   And we were going back and forth on that, and I actually wrote a long email, Dr. MacArthur.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.620]   I just want you to know that I was convinced after the first sentence.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.820]   Oh my, thanks for the rest.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:37.540]   But you know, when Peter calls himself Simeon, he's calling himself that.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:43.180]   You know, the liberals think that 2 Peter is a forgery that somebody in the second century
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.360]   wrote it.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.780]   But no forger would use Simeon in 2 Peter 1.1.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.620]   It's like a personal touch that Peter is giving.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.820]   This is my name, guys, you know.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.620]   And yeah, he was convinced.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:07.180]   And I think this shows us that when we try to just say what it says, there's significance
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.180]   to that.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.860]   We don't need to improve on anything.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.420]   And when you go back to it, there's always a significance to it.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:21.780]   You would assume, wouldn't you, that God is far more nuanced than we are, and that there's
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.740]   purpose in all of those?
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.500]   Yeah, that's wonderful.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:32.180]   So a personal question from the spiritual standpoint and from the standpoint of looking
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.380]   at your life and ministry in the future.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:44.420]   What value does this exercise have for you to go through so fastidiously every single
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.740]   word in the Bible and translate it?
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.980]   Who was the pilgrim's pastor, the guy in Holland, I forgot.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.240]   But he was famous for saying, "I am convinced that there are yet fresh things to come out
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.500]   of the Word of God."
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:07.260]   Well, this old guy here, you know, at 72, and I became 73 during the process, still
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.980]   saw some fresh things coming out of the Word of God.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:19.140]   And I can just say, you know, personally, it was a good spiritual experience for me
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.580]   working through every single word of the New Testament.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.140]   And now, with a little bit at a distance, the Old Testament, it was a great spiritual
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.140]   experience.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:36.020]   And I think the process also works to strengthen your doctrinal conviction, because you're
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:42.060]   finding other places that's being supported that you maybe hadn't thought of or discovered.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.460]   - Yeah, the depth of verbal plenary inspiration.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.540]   I was telling my students this.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.540]   I told them, "We don't even know how far that goes."
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.380]   Because all of a sudden, you start to realize, well, that word choice mattered, because it
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.580]   was linked with that word over there, which was linked with that word over there, and
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.460]   all of that was there.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.340]   And then you have alliteration here.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.780]   Sometimes we try to bring that out into the translation.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.980]   When they alliterated, we alliterated.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.340]   But sometimes you just can't, because it's English, and that's Greek or Hebrew, and you
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   can't make it work.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:23.060]   But you just realize how precise and exacting and exhaustive is God's inspiration of His
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.060]   Word.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   It's amazing.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.260]   - You know, just kind of thinking through a message for this coming Sunday, Jesus says
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:37.020]   to Nicodemus, "How can you be the teacher in Israel and not understand the new birth?"
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.300]   Somebody might say, "Well, that's a New Testament truth."
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:47.060]   No, how could you be the teacher in Israel and not know the Old Testament doctrine of
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.060]   regeneration?
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:58.140]   You know, Ezekiel and, yeah, so that ability, I mean, basically in my whole life, from the
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:04.900]   time I was a student, connecting the Bible became everything to me.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.780]   People who have come to our church recently, haven't been here, have said to me, "We've
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.140]   never heard so many Bible verses in a sermon.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.900]   Oh, you have so many Bible verses."
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.620]   But all I'm doing is connecting all the dots, and the more the translation enables you to
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:30.140]   do that, the richer, and not only the richer, but the more authority is built into the message.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:37.660]   And I can't imagine a greater benefit for a believer like you guys than to absorb more
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.780]   of the Word of God, just more and more.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:45.260]   I mean, I've always said that I'm the beneficiary of my sermons far more than anybody else because
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:51.020]   just getting to that point was intense and many more hours than you're preaching, you're
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.020]   preparing, so.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.180]   Yeah, I think back to those Wednesday morning Zoom calls that, you know, would go on for
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.620]   four or five hours, and they were mentally taxing, but they were just so edifying.
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.180]   And we weren't looking at each other's faces, we were all looking at one screen with the
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:11.080]   text on it, and it was just constant dialogue about what is the right translation here.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.100]   And for me personally, every single time, my eyes were just being opened more and more
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.460]   to all that is going on in Scripture, and you just see how wonderfully rich it is and
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.540]   how much more there is to explore.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.980]   Could make your sermons longer.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.620]   Just a couple of other questions.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.980]   You did some things to point out tense in the Greek, which sometimes get overlooked.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.180]   What would happen in those kinds of descriptions?
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:44.740]   Oftentimes the imperfect tense is overlooked, and some translations would just translate
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.100]   it as a simple past.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:54.120]   But there's an imperfective continuous aspect going on there in the past with the imperfect
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.060]   and a continuous action in the present.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.620]   And that's easily overlooked in a translation.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.100]   It's like the imperfect, he lifted up his eyes and he was praying.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.860]   It shifts to the imperfect.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.620]   So it's like he lifted up his eyes, that's just a, you know, an action.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:19.160]   But when the writer wants us to focus in closer on it, he was praying.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.380]   You know, it's like, and we tried to bring that out in the imperfect, or he continued
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.380]   praying.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:32.020]   You know, the imperfect can have an inceptive imperfect, he began praying, or a continuation,
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.360]   he continued praying.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.980]   We tried to bring that out without, you know, being overly crazy about it.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.700]   But I think that brings you up closer with the present and the imperfect tense.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:51.140]   You see the action, it's going on, it's more dynamic, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.980]   And that's because God put it there, you're recognizing that.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.620]   And I mean, it wasn't just the imperfects, it was also participles.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.780]   Jason, I know that you had some favorite examples of that.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:10.300]   Just Romans 12, even just a few years ago, trying to work through that, and it just sometimes
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:17.380]   it seems like Paul is giving, like, several different things that are disconnected, a
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.260]   way that sometimes it's translated.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.100]   So like, for instance, in verse 9 of chapter 12, "Let love be without hypocrisy."
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.700]   And then there's several participles that all connect back to show what this sincere
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.780]   genuine love without hypocrisy looks like.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:39.500]   And so we tried to really work at helping the reader see that, and then see how all
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.780]   of the various participles connect back to that idea.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:49.060]   So rather than a list of equal things, they're simply describing loving without hypocrisy.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.020]   Here are all these books that tell you how to do something when actually the Bible does.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.860]   So you can just read your Bible and find out how to love without hypocrisy.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.780]   Did you need to do this translation with some kind of a manual?
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.780]   Not exactly.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.820]   I think we've been trained by you.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.940]   But I mean, there is no manual on that.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.180]   You're just dealing with the original.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.540]   Well, I was trained by you and you.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.220]   But our chairman didn't give us a book that said, "You've got to do it this way.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   You've got to do it this way.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.220]   You've got to do it this way."
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   No, no.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:30.060]   He trusted us, under God, he trusted us to have our understanding of the original language.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.420]   And then also we met together.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.700]   You know, these 450 translations, you know why there's so many?
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.620]   Many of them are done by one guy, okay?
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.260]   That should not be done.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.900]   One guy should not do a translation.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.000]   You know, from the King James, you know, group on, there was a team because I might make
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.460]   a mistake.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.100]   And a brother can correct me and say, "You know, I think you're going in the wrong direction
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.100]   there."
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.260]   And we helped each other in that regard, whereas if it's just one guy, he's going to do it
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   and that's it.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.020]   And he answers to no one.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.900]   I like the team concept.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:12.140]   And the fact that you were operating not only from a scholastic level and a level of conviction,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:19.720]   but alive in the spirit, whereas there were guys in the original King James who were definitely
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.660]   not even converted.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:27.260]   So, but maybe being a little closer to the original by a few hundred years.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.340]   Well, I mean, we didn't have a manual, but we knew some principles and some goals.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.340]   Agreed upon.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.740]   And it was about what the text said as opposed to why it said what it said or making sure
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.260]   we focused on bringing the words over or consistency and upholding the translation where we could.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.180]   And we had to hold each other to those principles.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.500]   So there was no manual.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:57.220]   I wish sometimes there was a manual to make things easier, but we had to state some very
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.180]   core principles and then trust the Lord and trust each other.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.260]   And we're very like-minded and it was beautiful to see.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.660]   Sometimes we would come with a problem and that's where the team dynamic comes because
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.340]   then we work to solve it.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   That was always the trajectory.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.580]   It was always work to solve the problem.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.340]   And the solution was always better than the options originally given.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:23.280]   And if I get outvoted four to one, maybe that's telling me something that my idea may not
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   be the correct one.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.900]   You know, one of the things along that line that happens in a translation is it's made
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   up of a committee of people from different theologies and different categories.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.980]   And you've got to sort of play the game of I got my deal.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.180]   So in chapter five, you get your deal in chapter six.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.020]   And you didn't have any of that because you guys are on the same page.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.860]   So you feel that all of you can affirm this translation.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.580]   Nobody felt like he gave up something because he got something somewhere else.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.500]   And I think one of the really cool features of it too is, you know, you have these translations
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:04.900]   where they kind of parcel out either books or sections to a variety of different guys.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:11.860]   And so you get different flows and they translate something different in one than another book.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:18.260]   And the way we did it, I really was encouraged because all six of us are going through all
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.260]   of it.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.660]   We're not parceling it out.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:27.580]   And that was really, I think, just fun to see the camaraderie build and also to have
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.220]   six eyes on it, but yet have a consistency across the board.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.900]   >> Yeah, there's a continuity to that.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.980]   >> And we also had a few external reviewers as well, outside our group of six.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.460]   >> That was my next question.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:45.620]   So you guys care about each other and you love each other and you work together.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:51.740]   So you might be a little more amiable than people who aren't so connected.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.460]   So you did consult some other people.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.780]   You ran these things by people in the outside group for some validation.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   How did that go?
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.600]   How did that process work?
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:08.940]   >> So after we finished New Testament Psalms and Proverbs, we had a list of people, external
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.900]   reviewers is what we called them.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.980]   And we really appreciated them.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.900]   They gave sacrificially of their time to really look at the text carefully, to give us a lot
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.340]   of helpful notes.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:27.340]   And we sent copies of different books that they requested or parts of books that they
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.900]   requested for them to look over in that way.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.140]   And they would provide us feedback.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:40.700]   And because of the lockdown, the way we often did it was we would write their comments anonymous.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:46.260]   So no one knew who was saying what in a Google Doc, in an online spreadsheet.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.100]   And everyone had the opportunity to kind of interact and think through it.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.420]   And at one point, I remember because I'm filling out the spreadsheet, I think it was about
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.180]   a thousand comments a day.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.180]   >> A thousand comments a day from external readers.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.700]   Out of that thousand comments, did you find some?
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.540]   >> They were really good.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   They were really good.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.540]   They were very helpful.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.540]   >> So some of it was affirmation?
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.180]   >> Some of it was affirmation, but actually the thousand were issues we needed to think
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.180]   through.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   >> Wow.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.420]   >> And it's very significant.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.540]   >> And sometimes it would come out, "No, we made the right choice."
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.820]   And they didn't have the whole picture.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.820]   And that's not their fault.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.180]   We didn't give them the whole picture.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:29.500]   >> But just running your translation against that is very, very important for that external
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   reader.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   There were different types of people.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.420]   We had some language experts reading, but also some pastors.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.340]   And so both types of comments were coming at us, so we can think from both elements.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:46.500]   >> Yeah, and even some like long-term NAS readers that, you know, they love this translation
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   and just being able to --
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.540]   >> Was that the general consensus of the people that read it, that they liked it, that they
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.140]   appreciated what you have done?
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   >> I think so.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.140]   There was deep appreciation.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.820]   And there would be a lot of comments.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:04.300]   And I didn't always share it with the guys because my hands got tired typing.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.460]   But they would be, "Thank you for doing that.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.540]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.540]   Thank you for doing that."
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   >> And they were talking about something specific.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.540]   >> That's right.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.380]   They, you know, in 1 John, "Thank you for translating it that way.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   Thank you for doing that."
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.180]   You know, "Oh, thank you for doing that in Proverbs."
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.340]   >> So while this is your project at the heart, there's a consensus of guys on the outside.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.340]   >> Absolutely.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   >> But this is a worthy effort.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.340]   And it's not just within America.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.100]   It's going to be spread out outside of America to the broader English-speaking world because
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.780]   this isn't just going to be for Americans, we hope.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.180]   We hope it goes and reaches the world.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.620]   And so we wanted to make sure it connects.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.140]   >> Which is why it's not called the New New American.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.740]   >> Right, Paul?
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.740]   >> Amen.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.780]   >> Well, we got a few Russians and we got a UK guy.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.860]   I need to thank you all.
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.700]   I mean, I can't even calculate the hours.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:59.920]   I know it's taken over your life and the rest of you as well.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:06.740]   I think the Lord will put His stamp on this in the end and we'll know.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:13.440]   The question that might be a good wrap-up is, does this translation have the potential
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.660]   to last a while?
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.180]   Everybody seems to be chasing the vernacular.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.820]   You get a translation, two years later they want to do an update, and two years later
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.580]   they want to do an update as they chase vernacular.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.580]   What do you think?
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.540]   Now, having said that the NAS-95 is what this is based on, and that's a quarter of a century
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:40.140]   ago, you didn't make dramatic vernacular changes even in this from that one.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.820]   So do you feel this has lasting value, readability?
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.860]   >> I think, yeah, fundamentally it does.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:53.300]   And I think the philosophy behind it is what gives it long-lasting value.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:59.540]   Because if you make a translation in order to accommodate or to appease or to chase after
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:05.640]   the vernacular, well, you've already set up the translation to be replaced when vernacular
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.240]   changes and society changes.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:13.660]   But our translation philosophy was to do what they were doing before, like Dr. Varner mentioned,
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.340]   which was to move it back to accuracy.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.880]   And that was always the goal.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.980]   And for people who are inclined that way, then they don't want it to change because
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.300]   the Word of God doesn't change.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.880]   >> You know, and I'm sort of a living illustration of that.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.940]   Having preached for over half a century, I never felt any inclination to need something
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:41.220]   other than the NAS I was using, and I could make the adjustments I needed to make.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.620]   But I'm thrilled about this, not because it's driven by a new vernacular, but because it's
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.180]   driven by a desire to be more correct.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.660]   And so it will have a long, long life, and that's important.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:03.940]   I also remind everybody that when we started this, we said we're concerned with the author
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.940]   and not the reader.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:12.860]   That communicates that this is not about what a reader needs to read, but what the writer
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.260]   intended to say.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.740]   So that's the uniqueness of this.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.200]   So thank you.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.740]   And your work is not done?
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.740]   >> Not nearly.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.660]   >> But we're persevering, and they're doing a great job.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:36.260]   >> So when will the people see a translation of the Legacy Standard Bible that they can
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.780]   read?
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.620]   Will the first appearance of that be online?
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.620]   >> I think it'll be at Shepherd's Conference.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.620]   >> In March.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.620]   >> In March at Shepherd's Conference.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.820]   >> And they'll have that Psalms, New Testament, and Proverbs volume.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.620]   >> We're going to call that the Legacy Testament, I think.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.620]   Is that right?
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   >> Legacy Standard Bible, New Testament, with Psalms and Proverbs.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.620]   >> Okay.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   The full treatment.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.060]   >> And that'll be the first thing.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.060]   It's like a four by six?
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   >> Yep.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.060]   We have a mock-up.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:09.580]   >> Then, yeah, that—I asked for that because for years and years and years, I've used one
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:17.660]   of these in my shepherding ministry, and there it is, Legacy Standard Bible, New Testament,
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.660]   Psalms, and Proverbs.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.660]   Had you seen that before?
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.660]   >> It's a small one.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.660]   It's great.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.660]   It's beautiful.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:29.340]   >> But I've carried one of those for years in hospital visits and home calls and on the
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:36.340]   planes and wherever I go, and I want to have a tool that's easily transportable.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:42.780]   It's a whole lot more portable than a MacArthur study plane, which I have so that I know what
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.780]   I believe.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.540]   But anyway, that's actually the cover, isn't it?
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.740]   That's going to be a real—the pastors at Shepherds Convention are going to love that.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.940]   We opened the registration, right?
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940]   >> We did.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.500]   >> And 750 signed up the first day?
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   >> First week, yeah.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   >> First week.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.180]   >> They heard they were getting a free Bible.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.620]   >> You probably heard this.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.260]   This is beautiful.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.260]   [ Silence ]
