[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   It's easier than doing something moderately tough for a very long time. Which is why six-packs are so elusive. It's not that hard. Calorie deficit plus training, that's it. But you have to do it for a long time. And then he goes on. For reference, I was 300 pounds in 2010. I started dieting and training, got my six-pack in 2013. Three years. That's how long it took. But I wanted it so bad that I couldn't do it for a long time.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   It's kind of silly, kind of dumb. Feels dumb to talk for me sometimes. Talk about purely vanity goals. There's no functional benefit of a six-pack, at least that I'm aware of. But the thing to me, one of the reasons why it's important to me, is because when I achieve that goal, it will represent a complete transformation of my life.

[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.320]   but when you have paid the full price for financial independence,
