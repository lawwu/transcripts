[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.240]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. And today, my friend,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.800]   we kick off a series that I am just flat out stinking excited about because we are coming up
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:56.080]   on a new year. Today is December 2, 2019. 2019 is almost over. 2020 is almost here. And I love the
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.120]   turning of the years. I love the turning of the seasons. There's just so much meaning and impact
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.880]   for me when you roll over another milestone. And this one is especially exciting because it's the
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.640]   turn of a decade. And since my entire show, I lead every day with saying how do we get,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.360]   how to build a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. This is the decade, my friend.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.280]   This is the decade. And I want to be, I want you to be looking back when we're sitting down
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.520]   together talking, maybe we'll still be talking on a microphone, who knows, maybe it'll be
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080]   a virtual reality hologram in your eyeballs with special contact lenses that you wear,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.760]   eye contact that you wear around. And that's how I'm talking to you. However, we're communicating,
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.120]   when we're communicating a decade from now on December 1, 2029, and we're reflecting back over
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   this past decade, I want you to look back and say, that was the decade in which I lived with passion.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.040]   That was the decade in which I soaked up all of the richness and the beauty that life has to offer
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.720]   me. That was the decade where simultaneously I achieved financial freedom and I'm living a
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.840]   lifestyle of complete and total abundance. That's my goal for you. And I am dedicated to being here,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.120]   to working with you, to doing my very best to share anything that I can with you toward that
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.760]   end. And so in celebration of that theme, as we kick off December here, we're going to be talking
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.320]   about a lot related to that. And I want to start today by talking about goal setting. I want to
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.400]   talk about financial goal setting, how to set financial goals. And today we're going to deal
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.440]   with this in kind of a fuzzy way, meaning I'm not going to get into the specific numbers or things
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.840]   like that. I want to give you a big picture idea, just imprint a couple of important concepts on
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.760]   your brain to help you as we go forward in this series. But you've got to start to think
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.640]   about goals. Now, many of us have set goals and failed. Guess what that makes you? Human.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.800]   Because all of us have been there. There's nothing all that unique about setting goals and failing.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.240]   We've all done that. That's part of the process. But some people quit and I don't want you to quit.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.880]   And so I just want to hopefully encourage you for a couple of minutes about the importance of goals,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.360]   and most importantly, about the importance of financial goals. Financial goals are a little
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.480]   bit weird because a lot of people feel a little strange setting financial goals. Some people don't
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.880]   even set financial goals because they'd never thought that they could. But some people feel
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.560]   strange setting financial goals. Maybe they thought, "Well, money is not that important to me.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.120]   After all, there's more important things than money." Well, yeah, there are. The problem is
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.560]   that almost all of the important things require money. Money is at the root of almost any other
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:57.840]   goal. You name me the goal. I challenge you. You name me the goal that you have that doesn't
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.600]   involve money in some way. The only one I came up with was a number of years ago, I set a goal to
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.240]   build more intimacy in my relationship with my wife. And I started tracking how many times I
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.920]   hugged her every day. And I would keep a little checklist of, "Okay, hug my wife, hug my wife,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.400]   hug my wife." Okay, it didn't cost me any money to hug my wife. But I tell you what, as soon as I
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.480]   went beyond just hugging my wife and went to date night, all of a sudden, money came into the
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.160]   picture. Am I really going to spend that much money on a restaurant? Or am I really going to
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.320]   hire a babysitter? Am I really going to buy a fancy steak and cook at a home for her? What am
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.400]   I going to do? All of a sudden, money's there, even in the simplest things. And it doesn't even
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.720]   have to be a lot of money. My wife and I have great dates all the time where we spend almost
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.640]   nothing. She's cheap. It's great. I love it. It's a wonderful thing about her. But still,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   money's involved. And money's involved in almost everything, especially when you start to think
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   about living a rich life and you start to think about developing those peak experiences.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.200]   One of the things, I was going to share this later, but one of the things I'm excited to start,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.360]   I was in a bookstore, I was in the United States a couple weeks ago. And I was in a bookstore,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.120]   it was Barnes and Noble. And I picked up that little thing that they sell there, the five-year
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   journal. It was absurdly expensive. But I like to buy. I'm not frugal and everything. Sometimes I
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.600]   buy expensive journals. I used to hear Jim Rohn talk about why he would buy expensive journals.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.040]   And he would buy this fancy leather-bound journal to keep his notes. And he's like,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.720]   "I want my ideas to be worth something. And so I don't want to have dollar store
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.320]   ideas. I want to have good ideas." And I found that to be the same for me. So I've spent money
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.920]   over the years on nice leather binders and leather journals and things like that. And I picked up
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.200]   this five-year journal. And it's kind of cool because every page has a different date. And it
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.800]   starts at January 1, but then it has five years worth of entries above each other. It's very short,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:04.480]   about four or five lines for each one. But as you fill it in, you can reflect back on the previous
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   year. So you go through and of course, in 2020, if you start it, then you just have that year.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:17.120]   But then in 2021, when you're filling in January 1, 2021, you can see exactly what you were doing
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.440]   on January 1, 2020, because there's your journal entry. And then the years build up. And you don't
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.760]   have room for more than two or three sentences in the little journal. But I thought, "You know what?
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.080]   I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this over the next five years. And I'm going to make sure
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.640]   that this next five years from 2020 to 2025, I'm going to make sure that these are the best five
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.880]   years of my life. I'm in an exciting phase of life. I've got so many exciting things going on.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.600]   And I'm going to make sure that I have exciting things to put down in my journal. I'm going to
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.880]   make sure that I capture these memories. And that when I look back every single day on these past
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.120]   few years, that I've got good stuff to appreciate, good memories to go through in the TV of my mind."
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   So I picked up and paid the $16 or whatever for this little notebook that cost the guy $1.50 to
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.480]   print, which by the way, kudos on them. What a great business. But I picked it up. And I'm going
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:21.200]   to put millions of dollars worth of experiences in that. And I've lost my train of thought.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:34.960]   When thinking about building rich experiences, the point, it costs money to do that, to do some of
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:43.520]   the things. And I have no intention whatsoever of writing down those journal entries and, "Okay,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:53.680]   Tuesday, December, January 3, whatever winds up being in January, sat at home, drank water,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:03.600]   ate steak and did nothing, but saved money. Wednesday, sat at home, watched TV, did nothing.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.440]   Thursday, walked around the block for free, did nothing." Now, I don't, again, I'm not saying you
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.120]   have to spend money to live well. I've done lots of things for free and that's not the requirement.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.600]   But a lot of times, some of the things that at least I want to do cost money. And so when you
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.760]   have big goals, they cost money. I want to take, I've been able to take my children to dozens of
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.920]   states so far, but I want to take my children to all of the states. I want my children to be in
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.040]   all 50 states by the time they are out of my household. I haven't made the commitment to,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.440]   for sure, that I want to go to every country in the world, but at least I want to make sure that
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.400]   I've been to lots, but at least I want to make sure my children have been to dozens and dozens
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   of countries all around the world. And I mean, that's just scratching the surface of, I like
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.200]   travel, but that's just scratching the surface of the travel goals. And when I think about the
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.440]   kinds of lessons I want them to learn, and I think about the kinds of ideas I want them to be exposed
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.760]   to, and I think about the kinds of experiences I want us to have together as a family, I want to
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.600]   make sure that there is some really tough, really cheap experiences in there. I want them to sleep
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:24.320]   on a stony ground, bitten by mosquitoes under a, with a non-functional mosquito net in the jungles
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:32.640]   of El Salvador. But I also want to stay at a five-star hotel, you know, at the tip of, I want
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   to stay at the beautiful five-star lodge in Whistler, and us to have an epic week together
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:45.600]   at snow skiing. And I'm going on my list, but you make up your own. Every goal involves money
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.760]   in some way or the other. And so, it's important with any goal to count the cost, and especially
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.040]   with monetary goals, it's important to make sure that you have the goals set that you need to
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:03.920]   achieve in order to build and live the kind of life that you want to live. If you have a goal,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.800]   that goal is going to have a price tag associated with it. And you're probably going to have
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   multiple goals that have multiple price tags. And this is one of the major problems with financial
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:22.320]   independence, because the price tag of financial independence is very, very high. And it's easy
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.080]   to get obsessed about this idea of, I'm going to be financially independent as soon as possible.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.880]   But I have other goals that also have high price tags that involve spending money.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.160]   And so, it's totally possible to do all these things. We may not be able to do them all at
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.640]   the same time, but it's totally possible to do all these things if we understand the prices.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.080]   Let's get to it. I got three major points I want to leave you with in today's show. And we'll expand
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.000]   on these in the future and give more granularity to it. But I just want to make three major points.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:04.960]   Major point number one, you get one crack at this thing called temporal life. One crack at it.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.240]   There's only a handful of people that are going to come to your funeral.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.320]   There's only a handful of people that are going to remember you a few years after you're dead.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:26.400]   Don't you think it's worth it to get everything you can out of this life experience?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:37.360]   I believe that you deserve to have everything that you want.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.280]   Now, you're going to have to pay the price for it.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.720]   But you deserve to achieve your dreams if you're willing to put in the work for them.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:53.200]   But in order to achieve your dreams, you've got to start by having them.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:04.560]   And the basic set, the basic step of goal setting is the ability to dream. The ability to dream
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:14.000]   creatively. The ability to understand what you're going for. Now, if this comes easily to you
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.680]   and you think, "Well, duh, Joshua, doesn't everyone do that?" Let me tell you, no. Most people don't.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.760]   I don't know what the percentage is, but I've often been shocked at how few people
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.600]   have a clear understanding of what their dreams are.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I think the first and most important thing that you can do when it comes to goal setting is
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.840]   start by dreaming. Don't be scared to dream.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:52.080]   Just because you have a dream doesn't mean you have to follow through and do the work to achieve it.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:02.480]   But having a dream is going to be that basic step of setting out a system of goals.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:09.600]   So, one of the best and most important things that you can do
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   is to cultivate the habit of dreaming about your future.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.200]   Prioritize this. Don't be scared of it. Prioritize it.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.120]   And then make the time for it. Make the time to think.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.640]   Make the time to notice the things that you think about.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   It's never been easier to capture the output of your head.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.360]   Just go back a few thousand years. Very few people had writing utensils. Very few people had
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.160]   papyrus or parchment or whatever and had the skills to write. And so if you're going to capture
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.920]   the things that are coming out of your head, there was not really any way to do that. There'd been an
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.240]   oral culture of many people. And so you had to just talk about things, which was good.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.400]   But today, you can capture everything that comes out of your head. And now today, you've got a
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   voice recorder right on your hip. You've got a video camera right on your hip. And you've got
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.200]   a laptop right on your hip. You've got multiple ways of taking notes right in your hand.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.640]   So capture some of the things that you think about.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:30.880]   One of the little tips I would give you, the way that I have my phone set up, is have a shortcut.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.040]   At least in iOS, they have easy shortcuts. And you can add a shortcut right to the bottom of
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.520]   your home screen that will go immediately to a new note. And you can add a shortcut to your
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:46.960]   phone. And since, of course, we're all connected to our phones 24/7 and never outside of arm's reach,
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.920]   that's a really convenient thing to do, is have that there. So anytime I have an idea about a
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.320]   note, an idea, a dream, a goal, no matter how small or how big, I make sure to capture it.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:08.320]   Usually with swipe up, boom, new note. Or swipe up, boom, new voice recording. Capture that thought.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.960]   Because when you come up with a cool idea, it's important to notice it. And then in time,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.400]   you can dwell on it. You can flesh it out. You can decide if you want to discard it or if it's
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.280]   something that you want to pursue later or don't want to pursue at all. But if you don't start by
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:29.680]   actually dreaming and understanding what you want, you won't be able to make effective plans.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.560]   And since now it's so easy to capture copious amounts of data, go ahead and anything you see
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.000]   in your head, capture any texture to the goal. Capture any texture to the dream.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:55.840]   I have a dream of visiting all 50 states in the United States. And I think it would be really fun
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:02.880]   to do that in an RV. Or I think it would be really fun to do it on horseback. Or I think it'd be
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:11.120]   really fun to fly my airplane from grass strip to grass strip. Or I think it'd be really fun to take
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.000]   my children to all of the 50 state capitals. That's mine. Introduce them to governors and take
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.600]   them to all the battlefields, et cetera. Whatever. Write it down and give it texture. And then figure
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.480]   out some way to organize those things so you have lists of them.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.200]   And then what you do is when you're feeling unmotivated or you're feeling depressed,
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:46.000]   go to your goals. I find myself frequently feeling unmotivated, frequently feeling depressed. And I
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.960]   find it almost impossible to go and work on my goals and read my goals and listen to my goals
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.640]   and think about my goals and still stay unmotivated and depressed. Which brings me to the next
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:11.120]   important point. The reason why I find goals stimulating and enlivening is they're my goals.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.640]   They're not your goals. They're my goals. So make sure that when you're dreaming,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.640]   you set out your dreams. Make sure when you're setting goals, you set out your goals. Your
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:31.680]   actual goals. Not my goals. Your actual goals. Make them specific to you and make them specific
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:40.640]   to your phase of life. There's a difference between dreams, goals. Maybe we'll cover it
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.240]   another time. Maybe we won't. I don't know. But if you're going to achieve a goal, a goal is
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.880]   something specific. If you're going to achieve a goal, you've got to be able to believe that you
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.160]   can. Which means it's going to have to be something that you can, that's close enough to you that you
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.640]   can believe that you can get there. Now, if you don't believe that you can accomplish a goal,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.800]   it's fine. Just keep it as a dream until you can get to a point where you can see how you can
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.920]   believe it. Because what'll happen is as your skill of goal setting and your skill as a goal
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.680]   achiever grows, you'll be able to achieve bigger and bigger and bigger goals and your belief grows
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.520]   bigger and bigger and bigger. But that takes time. Don't want to scare you if you're just getting
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.400]   started. But your goals have to be your specific goals. So when it comes to things like financial
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.680]   goals, make sure they're your goals. Someone else's financial goal may be to make a million
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:35.200]   dollars this year. Your financial goal might be to save a thousand dollars or vice versa.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.800]   But if it's your goal, feel proud about the fact that it's your goal and make sure that
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.920]   you set out a plan to achieve the goal that you actually want. Now, let's say
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:58.480]   that you've got a big picture, a big idea for a big goal, but you're not sure if you can believe it.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:07.120]   Well, nurture it. Capture it. Just maybe hold off on necessarily writing it down every day,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.680]   but start looking to see if the thing that you're dreaming of has been accomplished by others
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:17.760]   and build your belief by studying the stories of other people like you who've achieved the
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:26.960]   kind of things that you would like to achieve. We live in a golden age of stories. It's never
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.320]   been easier to listen to incredible stories from fascinating people than it is today.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:40.880]   If you were to go back a century and you were to be plunked down in, well, it's one thing if
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.160]   you were to be plunked down in London, England or New York City, New York, or versus, you know,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.600]   little tiny town somewhere. But the stories you would have had access to would have been very
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:58.640]   limited. You would have had some stories by within your circle of acquaintance. You would have been
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.000]   able to have some stories at your local library. But the kind of people who would write and publish
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.600]   a book were very few and far between. But today, there are stories about all kinds of incredible
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.960]   people through digital means. YouTube, filled with inspirational stories, filled with people
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:25.120]   who have gone from poverty to wealth, sickness to health, unfulfillment to life satisfaction.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.880]   And when you start to surround yourself with those stories, you start to develop more belief.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.280]   And you start to see the patterns of how other people have accomplished their goals.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:42.400]   So, major point number one, as we start to get started on financial goal setting, dream. And
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.600]   don't be scared to dream. Write your dreams down. But make sure that your dreams and your goals
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:56.560]   are your actual goals. Because major point number two, you will have to pay the price
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:04.880]   for your goals in advance. That means that since the prices are often high,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:11.040]   and the payment is often significant, if you're going to go through that work,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:19.280]   you better make sure that you actually care about the outcome. I love the story. Brian Tracy tells
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   it in his books on and writing on goals. He talks about the famous oil billionaire H.L. Hunt,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.480]   who went bankrupt raising cotton in Arkansas and then went on to build a fortune of several
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.200]   billion dollars and become one of the world's richest man. Supposedly, he was asked once for
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.320]   his formula for success. And he said that in America, you only, and I would insert in America
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:46.720]   and most of the countries that this listening audience comes from, you only need two things
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:53.760]   to be successful. First, you need to decide exactly what it is you want. So, we've talked
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:02.240]   about decide exactly what it is you want. Most people never do that. Second, determine the price
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:11.920]   you're going to have to pay to get it and then resolve to pay that price. Decide exactly what
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.600]   it is you want, then determine the price you're going to have to pay to get it and then resolve
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.400]   to pay that price. See, most people have some idea of what they want.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.040]   But very few people sit down and figure out what it will take for them to accomplish
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.600]   what they want and to decide whether they're willing to pay the price.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:46.880]   When you do that, and if you really are clear, "Hey, I want this," and you figure out that price
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.360]   and you set the plan out, just like with financial planning where it's so simple,
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.960]   "I want to be financially independent." What does that mean to you? "This is how much money I want.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.000]   All right, let's start running some numbers. Where are you? What do you got to work with?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.680]   What rate of return can we get? And we can figure out what's going to be required."
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:12.080]   That's what's so wonderful about money is it's so tangible. And if you want to retire on $5,000
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.720]   a month, the price tag is X. If you want to retire on $10,000 a month, the price tag is X times 2.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:25.760]   You want $20,000 a month, price tag is X times 4. Are you willing to pay that price?
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:34.480]   In order for you to achieve a goal, you're going to have to pay the price in full.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.200]   Nobody stands on the Olympic podium who didn't pay the price for that victory.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.920]   Nobody stands at the door of retirement who didn't pay the price to be in that situation.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.080]   You're going to have to pay the price in full. You have to sow before you reap.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.920]   And that price may have to be paid over decades.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:09.840]   So, it better be something that you care about enough to pay the price,
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.560]   because you got to pay the price in full and you have to pay the full price in advance.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:25.840]   You will have to do all of the things in advance to accomplish the goal.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:36.000]   I'll just give you an example from my own goals. I personally have a goal set to have a six-pack,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.160]   a stomach that is flat enough and a low enough body fat percentage that I can see
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.640]   visible abdominal muscles. I have never in my life had a six-pack, not a once.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:52.560]   I've always been overweight, talked recently about that. And for the vast majority of,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.160]   well, I don't know if the vast, I would say majority of men probably have this same aspiration.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:05.440]   For men, having visible abdominal muscles is basically the mark of, "Okay, fine, I made it,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.800]   I'm fit," et cetera. For some people, it comes easier. For some people, it comes less easy.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:18.240]   I'm one who it doesn't come easy. But let's say that you hear, "Okay, Joshua, you've got that
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.360]   goal." And what if I tell you, "Well, I've got this goal set and I'm going to be successful,
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.440]   but I'm not willing to do anything for it." "Well, Joshua, there might be people out there
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.160]   who have that, but that's not you. You're fat. You don't have a six-pack. It's going to take you
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:42.880]   some work." Now, on the other hand, if you've got a plan, you say, "Okay, here's how you do it.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:49.920]   Here's the cost. Here's the price." When I have fully paid the price of eating in a certain way
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:57.680]   for a certain length of time, of exercising in a certain way for a certain length of time,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.720]   and when those things are achieved, when I've done enough of that for long enough,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.320]   then the results will be there. And it's exactly the same way with any goal.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:15.040]   Sometimes it takes a month. Sometimes it takes years. But when you have fully paid the price,
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.960]   then the success will be there. It's right there. But you've got to pay the price first.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.000]   There was a quote I read the other day, and I thought it was really inspirational. A guy on
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.120]   one of the... The guy on Twitter that I follow, he's a fitness coach. And he said, he wrote this.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.680]   He said, "Doing something really tough for a short amount of time is easier than doing something
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:52.000]   moderately tough for a very long time, which is why six-packs are so elusive. It's not that hard,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.520]   calorie deficit plus training, that's it. But you have to do it for a long time." And then he goes
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:05.360]   on, "For reference, I was 300 pounds in 2010. I started dieting and training, got my six-pack in
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:11.840]   2013. Three years, that's how long it took. But I wanted it so badly I could taste it,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.320]   and I refused to stop. You'll have to do that too, most likely." Now, it's kind of silly,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.640]   kind of dumb, feels dumb to talk for me sometimes, talk about purely vanity goals. There's no
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:31.120]   functional benefit of a six-pack, at least that I'm aware of. But the thing to me, one of the
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.960]   reasons why it's important to me is because when I achieve that goal, it will represent a complete
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.360]   transformation of my personal habits. I won't say character, although it's probably character,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.760]   character and personal habits. It'll be an absolute life change. And that's what I want,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.880]   is life change. Now, let's bring it back to wealth, something more at hand. The same exact
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.560]   thing comes in with wealth. If you want to be financially independent, you will be financially
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.160]   independent when you have paid the full price of financial independence. That's going to require
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:14.400]   you to work and earn more money. It's going to require you to spend less. It's going to require
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:22.160]   you to invest wisely. And it's going to require you to do those things for long enough for you to
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:35.040]   achieve financial independence. It's not a short-term thing. But when you have paid the full
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:47.520]   price for financial independence, you'll be there, guaranteed. So, think through and decide exactly
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   what it is you want. Then determine the price you're going to have to pay to get it and resolve
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:03.120]   to pay that price. Step number three, or major point number three, the clearer the goal,
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:15.440]   the easier the plan. For me, this has been a personal epiphany that I've come to over the years.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.240]   As I've done a lot of financial planning over the years, I've come to see very clearly
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   that the clearer the goal, the easier the plan. And basically, when I do personal coaching and
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.000]   personal consulting, almost, I don't know what percentage to say, maybe half the time, it just
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.200]   seems like I'm always going back to, "Well, what do you want?" Because if you can define clearly
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:47.440]   what you want, then the plans are fairly obvious. Let's give a financial independence example.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:55.280]   If you want, if your measure of financial independence is, "I want to have $1,500 a
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:02.640]   month of income coming in so that I can live a quiet and extremely frugal life in this particular
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   town." And you're gainfully employed, making $75,000 a year, the plan is obvious. Your plan
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.040]   is extreme frugality. Save, invest the money, mutual funds will get you there, you'll be there
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.520]   fairly quickly. It's obvious that that kind of financial independence plan is the best solution
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:30.720]   for you. On the flip side, if you say, "My goal is a much more luxurious and higher spending,
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:38.240]   higher consumption lifestyle. I want $300,000, $400,000 a year of spendable cash flow.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:47.600]   And I don't have a big income right now." The plan is obvious. If you really want that goal,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.280]   your only solution is to build and probably sell a business or to build a tremendous new career.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.440]   But frankly, not even that's going to get you there. You need to build a very large business
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.160]   that'll either be very profitable and you live off the profits or you sell it and live off of
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.320]   those profits. Now, that's painting with a very broad brush, but those are two both very doable
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.800]   financial independence plans. Both of them will work. But it all comes down to how clear is the
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:26.080]   goal. And in every single category, when the goal is clear, the plans are easy. They're self-evident,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.560]   they're obvious. You don't even need someone from an outside perspective coming along and saying,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.800]   "You should do this." They're obvious to you. So most of the time, the problem is not in lack of
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.680]   technical knowledge or lack of knowledge of how to achieve it. Most of the time, the problem is
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:48.960]   lack of clarity around the goal. And the great thing about this goal setting is this. The process
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.280]   of goal setting costs you nothing but time. I do this thing on Instagram where I share many
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.840]   mornings. I share a picture of my goal setting. I write my goals out every day, every day. Pen,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:07.280]   piece of paper, blank sheet of paper, top of the page, today, December 2, 2019, Joshua's goals.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.320]   Sometimes I just write a couple quick task marks, a couple words each. Sometimes I write paragraphs
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   and paragraphs. Sometimes I write pages about one single goal, but I write them out consistently
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.080]   because that process clarifies all of the steps needed necessary.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:28.960]   And then even if you don't quite know how to achieve something, it'll all fall in place.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:40.320]   So spend as much time as needed to get clear on what you want.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.480]   That's all I want to say in today's show. Three major points. Number one,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:56.320]   dream. Don't be scared to dream. Make sure that since you're going to have to put in a lot of
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.720]   work to achieve the things that you want, make sure you actually want it. Make sure you're pursuing
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.800]   your goals, your dreams, your actual goals and dreams, not the goals and dreams that someone
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.560]   else has said to you, not the goals and dreams that society has given to you. Quick diversion.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.280]   When I was an active financial planner, I used to go through this stated fact-finding perspective,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.160]   this fact-finding process, ask the same questions every time. I didn't like asking people,
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.440]   do you want to retire someday or when do you want to retire? So I would always ask this.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.680]   I would say, is there a point in time that you'd like to be in a position to not to have to work
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.200]   if you didn't want to? And the answer would always be yes. And of course, I would always say when?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:45.120]   Well, about 15% of the time, the answer was today. When? But about 70% of the time,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.040]   60, 70, that huge majority of the time, the answer was, I don't know, 65.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:37:01.680]   65. And to this day, that drives me nuts. Because the only reason why all of my clients would say
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:08.640]   65 was because 65 was at that time the normal retirement age for social security income.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:21.120]   But what on earth does 65 matter to you? Why 65 and not 63? Why 65 and not 67?
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.760]   Is there not anything in there that would matter to you?
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.520]   Why 65? The reality is most people didn't have a clue when they wanted to retire
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.320]   because there was no meaning at all whatsoever to 65. And as I watched and observed,
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:47.040]   I would see that most people wouldn't successfully retire because 65 didn't mean anything to them.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   Maybe their company forced them out. Okay, I got social security, I'll go ahead and take it.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.800]   But unless 65 means something to you, don't retire at 65.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:02.080]   Now, if it means something to you for some other reason, maybe a certain age of your children,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.520]   or a certain thing you want to accomplish in a certain calendar year, or a certain
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.720]   milestone that it represents, fine.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:14.320]   But make sure that your retirement goal is your actual retirement goal.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.040]   Don't just get involved in the FIRE movement because all the cool kids are doing it.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:29.840]   If you don't want to retire, don't get involved in the FIRE movement.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:37.120]   That's enough for now. Major point number one, dream. Don't be scared to dream. Make sure they're
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:44.160]   your goals. Major point number two, decide what you want, find out what the price tag is, and
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.320]   resolve to pay that price. You're going to have to pay the price in advance. So you got to know what
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.800]   it is so that you can know the price you're going to pay. You're going to have to pay the price in
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.400]   full before that goal is there. So make sure that it's something that you care about, that you're
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   willing to pay the price. Number three, the clearer the goal, the easier the plan. If you're struggling
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.680]   with what your financial goals are, how to set financial goals, don't worry too much about the
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:20.000]   details. Don't worry too much about is it rental houses or is it an MLM or is it Bitcoin or whatever.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.800]   Get clear on the goal. And when you're clear on the goals, the plans fall in place.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   Friends, we are at the dawn of a new decade. The dawn of a new decade. And a decade is all the
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.400]   time you need to accomplish everything you can dream and put on your list.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:50.800]   No, I don't believe that. A decade is all the time you need to accomplish many, if not most of the
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:57.360]   things that you need, that you want to put on your list. Can't do all of them in a decade.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:04.080]   And I encourage, I think one of the things that's so needed once you start to become a skillful
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:12.160]   goal setter is to have long-term goals and short-term goals, very long-term goals. I have
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:19.840]   on my goals an age that I want to live to. And I visualize every day an age that I want to live to.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.520]   I have a goal for my grandchildren's grandchildren. And the legacy that I want to leave for my
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.560]   grandchildren's grandchildren. Those things are long-term. I can't accomplish them in a decade.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.560]   But then there's short-term stuff too. But for the vast majority of the normal things that we set,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:44.800]   a decade is long enough. A year is too short, but a decade is long enough. And if you just get
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.480]   directionally moving in the direction of your goals, the path will have a tendency to take
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:41:03.760]   care of itself. So my challenge to you, get a pen, piece of paper. If you don't have a pen and
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:10.160]   a piece of paper, put your phone on airplane mode and do not disturb. Open a blank note.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:19.360]   Start dreaming about where you want to be in 2030. Capture those dreams. Play with them.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.000]   Go over them in your head, twist them around, flip them upside down. Look left, look right.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.440]   Get them clear in your head. And we'll start to talk about how they can actually be accomplished.
