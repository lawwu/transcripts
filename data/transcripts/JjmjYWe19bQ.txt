[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.400]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 8 and verse 12, the twelfth verse of the eighth
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.280]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:25.720]   Then speak Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that followeth
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.600]   me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.320]   We come back to consider this great and momentous statement once more because it holds us face
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   to face with the great offer of the Christian Gospel, the Christian message, the Christian
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320]   faith.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.360]   Here we have it from the lips of our Lord himself.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.320]   He tells us what he can do for all who are ready to follow him.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.160]   And what he says is this, that we can be delivered from darkness.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   We can be delivered from walking in darkness.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.080]   You see, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is very practical.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.200]   It starts by telling us that we are living in a world of darkness, that we don't know
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.920]   where we are and we don't know where we are going.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040]   We don't know what to do.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.160]   That is the fundamental postulate of this biblical message, Old Testament and New alike.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.600]   That is really the reason for the message at all.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.920]   If the world were a perfect place, there would be no need of a Gospel.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.480]   If everybody was basking in the light and dwelling in it and walking in it, well, there
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.880]   would be no need of Christianity and of the Christian church.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   So you see, there is the beginning, there is the first point.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.320]   We are in a world of darkness.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.720]   We don't understand the world.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   We don't understand ourselves.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.680]   We don't understand what's happening in the world.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.200]   There's no need to prove this, is there?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.160]   The darkness of the world is surely more evident today than it has possibly ever been.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   The darkness of the moral muddle, the darkness of men fighting men, preparing for war, in
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.000]   spite of all that's happened to him twice over in this one century, man doesn't learn
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.260]   the lesson.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.160]   Man still goes on in the same old way, and there doesn't seem to be any light.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.040]   Nobody seems to know why these things happen.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   Everybody as an individual seems to be denouncing it, and yet collectively these are the things
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   that men do.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.280]   Well, we are in a world of darkness, I say.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.040]   And here we are confronted by one who stands up and says that it's possible for us to be
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.760]   delivered out of this darkness.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.600]   He that followeth me, he says, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.460]   There's no need, he says, to go on any longer like that.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.000]   You can be given an understanding of life, you can be given an understanding of yourself,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.040]   you can be given an understanding of the world in which you live, you can be given an understanding
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.240]   of history, you can be given an understanding of the future, both the future of life in
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:35.880]   this world and that great eternal future that lies beyond the veil to which we are all hastening.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.200]   Now this is, of course, a very momentous and a very striking statement, and that is why
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.720]   we are considering it together.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.880]   This is Christianity, this is the message of the Christian Church, to proclaim and to
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.520]   announce that this is possible this evening, that nobody need go on any longer walking
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.160]   in darkness.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   With all the darkness within and without, it can come to an end.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.000]   There is a light of life possible.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.420]   Now we've been engaged in considering the ways in which our Lord gives us that light,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.720]   but tonight, having done that, I want to consider this with you.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   Have you got this light?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.600]   Are you enjoying this light?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.560]   Are you walking in this light?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.080]   How do you feel as you look at yourself and as you look at the whole world this evening?
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600]   Is it all a complete muddle to you?
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.080]   Do you say, "Well, I don't know, I don't understand"?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.560]   You know, that's what the majority are saying.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.120]   They've even stopped thinking.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.400]   The majority of people in this world at this moment, in spite of all that they read in
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.320]   their newspaper about the tension and the uncertainty, even the possibility that somebody
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   may let off a bomb or pull a trigger that'll smash the whole world up and end everything,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.400]   in spite of that, the vast majority of people have given up thinking.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.600]   They say, "What's the use of thinking?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.800]   What's the value?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   Nobody seems to know.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.920]   People are talking, but they've always been talking, but all they've said has been falsified
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.200]   by events and by facts.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.520]   None of it comes true.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.920]   The statesmen are obviously baffled.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.320]   They don't understand.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   Nobody understands."
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.720]   So they say, "What's the use?
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.920]   What's the use of anything?"
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.680]   They become utterly desperate or they become cynical, and in both cases they come to the
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   same conclusion.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.240]   They say, "Let us eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.640]   Let's try and make the best of every moment we can.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.120]   We may not have many, but no, that's a council of despair, isn't it?
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.520]   That's just to give up and to give in and to say, 'Well, the outlook is so black, the
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080]   world is in such darkness that there is no light possible.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.800]   Give in, give up.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.560]   Just make the best of the moment.'"
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.640]   But you see, over and against all that, here it is.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   Light is possible.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.960]   There's no need to walk in darkness.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.440]   This gospel offers to deliver us from the darkness, to take the darkness out of us,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.680]   and to give us the light of life.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.880]   Now, this isn't something theoretical.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.480]   This is a fact, because we've got history here in the Bible which shows that the very
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.840]   thing that our Lord himself offered literally actually came to pass.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   There are instances in the Gospels while he was still here himself, of men and women who,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.720]   having listened to him and having done what he said, found their lives completely changed
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.920]   and revolutionized.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.960]   And you get it in the subsequent history.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.400]   I read for you tonight, for instance, what we are told there at the end of the second
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.520]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:02.320]   There on that first day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, nearly two thousand years ago, three thousand
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.480]   people passed immediately from darkness into light.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:17.200]   People who had started listening to the Apostle Peter in complete darkness suddenly saw this
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   light and entered into it.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.640]   And you noticed the result.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.400]   Gladness, joy, understanding, happiness.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   And on they went.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.820]   Clearly, men whose problem has been solved.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.080]   Everything had been changed for them.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.080]   Well, now, there it is.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.480]   There is one example.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.000]   Three thousand people on the day of Pentecost.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.480]   But our Lord said, "You see, actually came to pass."
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.360]   "He that followeth me," he says, "shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   of life."
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.280]   And three thousand had it after one sermon.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.940]   And you go on reading the book of the Acts of the Apostles and you find the same thing
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940]   being repeated.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.120]   And you go on reading the history of the Church and you'll find that that has gone on through
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   the running centuries.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.360]   Sometimes it's just been an individual here and there.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.400]   Sometimes in periods of what we call revival, thousands again have come to see this light.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.480]   Their whole life has been changed.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.800]   The darkness has gone.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.760]   And they've suddenly had an understanding of the whole thing and have entered into a
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   great joy which has enabled them to live in a new way and to die with triumph and with
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   a sense of glory.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.120]   Very well, the question is this, isn't it?
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.600]   Have we got that light?
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.640]   Are you surprised at the state of the world or have you got the explanation given here
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.200]   of it all?
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Do you see why the nations are behaving as they are or are you completely amazed at this?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.000]   If you follow the world's philosophy you'll be amazed because that's been telling us now
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.640]   for so long that everything's developing and advancing and that man, educated, scientific
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.160]   and so on, is no longer a fool.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.120]   But he obviously is a fool.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.960]   And yet you see there's light here which shows exactly why things are as they are, gives
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.000]   us an insight into the future course of history and enables us even to look into the face
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.640]   of death without being frightened and without whimpering, gives us light on what lies beyond
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.920]   death and the grave.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   It's here.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.000]   Or do you want life as to how to live?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.800]   Well it's here.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   And it's here alone.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.600]   "I and I alone," he says, "am the light of the world."
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.960]   Well now my friends, I ask my question, have we got this light?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.440]   Wouldn't you like to have this light?
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.040]   Let me ask the third question.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.840]   How can one obtain this light?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   The light of life.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.600]   Oh, to be able to live worthy of the name of men.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.400]   Oh, to live as children of the light and children of the day instead of to be groping in the
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.000]   darkness or to sit down in utter and final despair.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.200]   How does one get this light of life?
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.560]   Our Lord answers the question.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:08.040]   "He," he says, "that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   of life."
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.200]   Therefore the thing for us to consider this evening is as to the meaning of these two
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.880]   words "follow me."
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.560]   What does that mean exactly?
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   What does that include?
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.600]   "Ah," says someone, "I'd give the whole world if I could only have this light.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.120]   I'm unhappy, I'm miserable, I'm baffled, I admit I'm defeated and what I need is light
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.040]   and I need life.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   How can I get it?"
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   Well here's the answer.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.800]   "Follow me," he says.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.400]   But what does this mean?
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   Well now let's look at this together briefly this evening.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.720]   The first thing obviously that it must mean is this, that we must believe him.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.800]   I mean by that that we must believe that he is who he says he is.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.960]   Now you notice how he goes on repeating that phrase.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   He says, "Unless ye believe that I am he."
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.760]   That's his phrase, "I am he."
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.720]   He says, "If you believe that I am he, you'll have the light of life.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.360]   If you don't believe that I am he, you'll die in your sins."
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.880]   So the first thing obviously is this, and in any case it is the obvious question to
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.380]   ask, isn't it?
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.880]   If I'm confronted by a person who says to me, "Now look here, you just follow me.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:30.600]   You just come after me and do what I tell you and everything will be all right."
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.920]   The first thing to ask about such a question is this, "Yes, that's all right, but who
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   are you?
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   What are your credentials?"
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.280]   There are many charlatans in the world who come with their nostrils, they can solve all
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.960]   our problems for us.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.320]   They can tell us exactly what to do.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.200]   They've got a quick way of making a man's fortune.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.820]   "Do what I tell you," they say.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.980]   But then the first question, if you're sensible, you ask is this, "Well, who is this man?
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980]   What are his credentials?"
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.160]   Before I take the risk of following him, before I forsake what I'm already doing and the
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.860]   ideas that I already have, I want to know who this person is.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.220]   It's a tremendous thing for a man to say, "Follow me."
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.420]   It means an utter absolute allegiance.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.020]   Well then, I ask, "Who is he?"
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.060]   Now that is the question.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.960]   You notice that these people to whom he was speaking kept on asking the question, "Who
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   are thou?"
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.600]   Yes, but you know, the way in which you ask that question is very important.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.320]   They asked it in utter sarcasm and derision.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.240]   They said, "Who are thou?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   Who are you to be saying, 'Follow me'?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.880]   You're only a carpenter, and you come from Nazareth, and no good has ever come out of
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Nazareth.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   Who are you?
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.560]   You're not a Pharisee.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.400]   You've not been trained in the law.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   You're not a Sadducee.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   You're not a priest.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   Who are you?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.240]   Who are you to stand up and say like this, 'Who are thou?'"
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   Utter sarcasm.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.760]   Well, I needn't remind you that if that's our approach, nothing will ever come of it.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   But there's another way of asking the same question.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.920]   Here you look at this extraordinary person, this carpenter, I say, brought up in Nazareth.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.880]   Oh, here he is at Jerusalem, at the center of learning, the center of religion, on the
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.360]   great feast occasion.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.280]   He stands up and he says with the great candelabra behind him, typifying the light that the Messiah
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.560]   who was to come was to give.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:35.240]   He stands up and he points at it as it were and says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.680]   And the right way to ask the question is this, "Who are you?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   What are you?
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   Who are you to make such an extraordinary statement that you are the light of the whole
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.800]   world and that you alone are the light of the whole world?"
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.240]   You ask your question in amazement and in reverence.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.680]   You ask it because you want to know more about him.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.800]   You don't ask it in this way that they asked in order to turn him down.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.200]   That isn't asking a question that's making a pronouncement.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.760]   Oh, but if we really are concerned, if we really are honest with ourselves, if we are
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.960]   true seekers for light and for truth, for knowledge, deliverance, redemption, understanding,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.600]   well then I say we'll come to him as suppliants, we'll come to him as beggars, we'll come
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.440]   to him in our ignorance and darkness.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.600]   We'll look up into his face and say, "Tell me, who are you?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.620]   You're saying the very thing I want to hear, but who are you before I risk my all and come
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   after you?
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.620]   Who are you?"
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.480]   Well, thank God he answers the question.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.680]   He even answered it for these people.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.920]   These people who treated him with their sarcasm and derision.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:54.000]   Now my friends, I simply want to hold before you what he says about himself.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.120]   It was because they believed these things that the three thousand on the day of Pentecost
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.720]   became Christians and became so glad and so happy, shared all their goods in common and
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.560]   rejoiced in being in the company and the society and the teaching of these apostles.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   Three thousand of them, they believed what?
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.920]   Well, what he says here about himself.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   What does he say?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.560]   Well, the first and striking thing he says about himself is this.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:27.040]   He says, "I know whence I came and whither I go, but you cannot tell whence I come and
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.120]   whither I go."
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.660]   Look at this person, Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.560]   This man who stood up there in the temple and said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.800]   This is what he says about himself.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.320]   He says, "Now listen to me, I'll tell you why you should follow me.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:48.120]   I know whence I came and whither I go."
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.040]   You get the significance of that statement?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.460]   Tell me.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:00.840]   Can you tell me whence you came and whither you go?
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.400]   Could you stand in this pulpit tonight and say, "I can tell you where I've come from
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.000]   and where I'm going."
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.760]   Can you?
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.240]   Of course you can't.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.560]   You don't know.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.240]   We none of us know.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   We find ourselves in this world.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.560]   We know the theories.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.480]   We've read the theories of the philosophers.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.960]   Plato believed that we existed somewhere before being in this world.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.760]   There are people who still believe that sort of thing.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.280]   Reincarnation, things like that.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.520]   Well, I'm not going to wear you with these various theories.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.800]   There are many theories, but they're all theories, of course, and our consciousness
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.040]   is this, that we just don't know.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.960]   Our idea is that we began living when we were born into this world, and the real beginning
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.240]   of living is the first dawning of consciousness.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.600]   We don't know.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.400]   We start there.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   Then whither I go?
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   Well, now, where are you going?
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   Do you know?
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.800]   Can you tell me about your future course?
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.920]   Can you tell me what's going to happen to you?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.360]   You don't know how many years you're going to live?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   Then you're going to die.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   But what then?
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   Where are you going?
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   Do you know?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.560]   Ah, my friends, here is a person.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.080]   Here is an extraordinary person.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.560]   Here is someone who is quite unique and alone in this respect.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.320]   He says, "Look here.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:44.120]   I know where I've come from, and I know where I'm going."
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   What's he mean by that?
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   He means this.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.680]   He didn't begin in Bethlehem.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   He didn't begin when he was born.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.360]   That's true of everybody else, not of him.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   And this isn't a theory, you see.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   He says, "I know."
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.480]   He only came into this world in Bethlehem.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.840]   He's come from somewhere else.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.480]   He's come from eternity.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.480]   He's come from the everlasting.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.880]   He's come from the unseen realm.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.560]   He's come out of eternity into time.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.920]   I know whence I am come.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.760]   There's a great story before he ever came into this world.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.240]   Would you like to know something about it?
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.480]   Well, John has given it us, you see, at the very beginning of his gospel.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:40.880]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   The same was in the beginning with God.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.720]   All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.520]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   That's it.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.920]   "I know whence I am come."
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.400]   He doesn't hesitate to make a statement like that.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.600]   Listen to him.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   Realize what he's saying.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.000]   And in the same way, he says, "I know where I'm going."
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.320]   Where is he going?
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   He's going back to the place from which he came.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.120]   You will find him later on in chapter 17 of this same gospel, praying to his Father and
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.040]   saying, "Father, I now come unto thee."
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.600]   And he says, "Give me again the glory which I had with thee before the foundation of the
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   world."
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   That's how he spoke.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   He knows about it.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.000]   He knows where he's come from.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.520]   He's come from heaven.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.220]   He's going back into heaven.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.520]   And he knows exactly what heaven is like.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   He started there.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.840]   He's come down into the world.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.000]   He's going back out of it, back to heaven where he was from all eternity.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   That is his statement.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That is his claim.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.880]   Oh, let's go on.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.640]   The second thing he says is this, that he's altogether different from all other men.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.440]   He's already said it there, but he says it now much more explicitly in verse 23.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.040]   He said unto them, "You are from beneath.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.520]   I am from above.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.080]   You are of this world.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   I am not of this world."
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.220]   You know, my friends, there is nothing more important for us in this world this evening
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.400]   than just to know exactly who this person is.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.240]   Because here he is saying things that nobody else has ever said before, and nobody has
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.280]   ever said since.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.240]   There is no more momentous fact confronting human beings this evening than this person
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.320]   who stood up there in the temple and said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.000]   For believe me, apart from this person, it's nothing but chaos.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   There is no hope.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.440]   The world is mad, and it's going to hurtle itself to a final destruction.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.320]   But if this is the Son of God as he claims to be, well, then I say there is light and
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   there is hope.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.720]   So, you know, this is the most important question for you.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.520]   This is the business of Christianity, to get men and women to confront this blessed person.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.820]   I'm not interested in your views on this, that, or the other.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.040]   People are arguing and discussing about these various matters.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.660]   Believe me, none of it matters until you're clear about this person.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.580]   This is the fact.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.580]   And this is what he says.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.760]   He says, "You know, I'm not like you.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.680]   You all belong to this world, to this realm of time.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.000]   You're all human beings."
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   He says, "You are from beneath."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.080]   That's what he means.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.280]   He explains it by saying, "You are of this world."
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   And we are, of course.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.640]   We are creatures of this world.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.740]   We are born into it.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:40.120]   We bring with us from our birth a great deal of things that have belonged to our fathers
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.580]   and forefathers.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.480]   We are from beneath, from all that's gone before us.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.080]   Heredity is tremendously important, isn't it?
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   Yes.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.440]   We all start with prejudices and with instincts and the balance of these things determined
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   by our forebears.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   There's no question about that at all.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.040]   And then we come into the world and are immediately influenced by its mind, by its outlook, by
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.240]   its understanding.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.640]   We think as the world thinks.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.680]   We reason.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.560]   We do all the things the world does.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.520]   That's our outlook and we can't get beyond it.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.800]   The highest philosopher, the greatest mind, the greatest brain that the world has ever
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.680]   known has never been able to get beyond this world.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.280]   They've speculated about the other, but they don't know.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   They've tried to.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.000]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.840]   They tried to find him, but they couldn't.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.200]   They've been trying to see beyond the veil.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.360]   They've been doing their psychic research and other things.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.160]   They're doing it now, but they can't get there.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   They can't penetrate.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.280]   They're of this world.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   You are from beneath.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   You are of this world.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.920]   But he says, "I'm not.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   I'm not.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   I'm in it.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.520]   I'm a man as you all are, but you know, I don't belong in the sense that you all belong.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.720]   You are all one and there's no exception to you.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.880]   I've come amongst you.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.560]   I've come into this world of yours.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:05.360]   I've taken on human nature, but you know, I'm not one of you."
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.040]   Now that's a tremendous statement to make, isn't it?
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.880]   Here he is, this carpenter of Nazareth.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.560]   He stands up and says, "I am from above.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.240]   I am not of this world."
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.920]   He's different.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   He's come into it.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   He isn't of it.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.080]   He isn't a product of it.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.400]   He hasn't been thrown up by it.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.600]   And isn't it obvious as you look at him and all his teaching?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.280]   You can't explain Jesus Christ in terms of human history and human development.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.880]   He stands out nearly two thousand years ago, towering above all before him and after him.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.480]   You can't explain Christ.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.720]   He's a root out of a dry ground.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.960]   He's someone unique and he says he is.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.520]   He says he's not of this world.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.000]   He doesn't belong to it.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   He's come into it.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.040]   He is a man, but he's not only a man.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.800]   There is this essential difference and it works out in every respect.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.360]   He says, you see, that his thinking is different.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.040]   He says that the words that are given to him are not his.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.200]   He says, "I have many things to say and to judge of you, but he that sent me is true
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:13.440]   and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him."
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.760]   What men dare say such a thing?
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.200]   Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, all the philosophers, what do they say?
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   Well they say this.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.640]   They say, "Now I've given this much thought.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:32.040]   I've meditated much about this and I've read many books and I have come to this conclusion."
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   Quite right.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.280]   Well worth studying.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.160]   Well worth dealing with, treating with great respect.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.880]   But you see, they never go beyond that and they're right.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.480]   They say, "This is what I've come to as my conclusion."
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:53.040]   Here is one who says, "What I'm saying to you is what I have received of my father.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   They're not my words.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.480]   They're not my works.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.320]   I'm telling you what he's told me to say.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.480]   I'm doing what he's told me to do.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   I've been with him.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.320]   I was with him from all eternity.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.760]   I was with the father.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   He speaks to the father face to face.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.680]   He is the mouthpiece of God.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   He's the word of God."
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.080]   That's what he claims.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.960]   I mustn't hold you with these individual things.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.040]   I want to give you this composite picture.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.640]   The next thing he says is that God witnesses to him.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.920]   He says that twice over.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.440]   Listen to it in verse 16.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.560]   He says, "And yet if I judge, my judgment is true.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.040]   For I am not alone, but I and the father which sent me."
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.760]   And then in verse 18, "I am one that bear witness of myself, and the father that sent
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.200]   me beareth witness of me."
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.840]   He says, "You people, you say you won't believe unless a man can bring forth two witnesses."
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.440]   All right, you're perfectly correct in saying that, but I've got two witnesses.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.560]   I am one, and my other witness is my father.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.160]   Is there ever a man who has made such a statement?
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.480]   No, no.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   This is unique.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.440]   How has God borne him witness?
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.080]   Well, in the Old Testament.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   There in the Old Testament, prophecies from the very beginning, even from the Garden of
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.800]   Eden, God had been making promises.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.360]   He was going to send a deliverer, a Messiah.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.800]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.680]   That's the original promise.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.480]   And thank God for it tonight.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.000]   The serpent, his activities are very obvious in this modern world, aren't they?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.120]   The evil and the sin, the hatred and the malice.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.680]   Where does it come from?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.200]   From hell, from the devil.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:44.280]   The serpent that has entered in, spitting out his vile poison and his poisoned life,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.240]   he's poisoning it tonight, taking the pure and making it impure, taking the clean and
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.280]   making it dirty, taking the beautiful and turning it into ugliness.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.440]   The serpent with his venom, with his spite, his spleen, his malice and all that is so
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.920]   true of him.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:08.680]   Ah, but thank God, God has promised that he is going to send a deliverer through the woman.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.760]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.360]   And he went on giving his promises throughout the running centuries through his servants,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.360]   the prophets.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.360]   What is he doing?
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.280]   He's bearing witness to this one who is to come.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   Here he is.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.640]   My father bears witness to me.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.760]   But he not only did it in that way, he did it actively even while his son was in this
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   world.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   How did he do it?
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.640]   He did it at his baptism.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.560]   He did it at the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:41.280]   The voice spake from him saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.720]   In the twelfth chapter of this Gospel you'll find that the voice came again when he began
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.480]   talking about his death and his miracles.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.640]   He turned to these same Jews who wouldn't believe in him a little later and he said,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.520]   "Though ye believe not my words, believe me for the very work's sake."
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.320]   He says, "Look what I'm doing."
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.800]   He sent the same message to John the Baptist who was in a little bit of doubt.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.840]   The blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf are
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.360]   made to hear, and even the dead are raised.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.520]   The Gospel is preached to the poor.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.560]   That's what the prophet said the Messiah would do.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.480]   "Look at what I'm doing.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Look at the works."
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   He challenged them.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   "Look at the works."
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.080]   That is his father's witness and testimony to him.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:34.600]   And then I lead you to the other thing, the last thing, but it's a very striking one.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.680]   Did you notice how he keeps on talking about his death?
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.280]   Did you notice his knowledge about his own death?
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:51.120]   Here it is in verse 14, "I know whence I came and whither I go."
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.160]   What a way to look at the end of your life and at your death and what lies beyond.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.640]   I know all about it.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   Do you know all about it?
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.160]   Has any man ever claimed that?
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   Of course not.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:07.280]   "Oh no," says Shakespeare, "thoughts of that unknown bond from which no traveler returns,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   that's the trouble.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.400]   We don't know and nobody comes back to tell us."
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.440]   Here's one who says, "I know where I'm going."
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.760]   But then we've got an interesting statement here in verse 20, "These words speak Jesus
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.560]   in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.720]   was not yet come."
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.240]   His hour was not yet come.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.680]   You know he knew about this hour.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.400]   A little later on he stood again and he said, "Father, the hour is come."
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.480]   Here is one who knows how long he's going to live and he knows about his own death.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.720]   Listen to him putting it again in verse 21, "Then said Jesus again unto them, 'I go my
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.680]   way and you shall seek me and shall die in your sins.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.840]   Whither I go you cannot come.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.520]   I go my way.'"
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.360]   What a way to speak about death, I say.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:14.200]   Here is one who sees through it, knows exactly what it's going to mean, knows exactly what
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.280]   it's going to lead to.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.660]   He's a master of life, he's a master of death.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.560]   He talks about dying as, "My way, I'm going my way."
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.520]   "It isn't your way, you won't be able to come after me.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   You'll try but you won't.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.720]   You'll try to seek me."
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.960]   They misunderstood the whole thing.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.560]   They said, "Is he going to commit suicide?"
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   "No, no."
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   They didn't understand.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.040]   You see, he says, "I know exactly the meaning of death as far as I'm concerned.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.120]   I know what's beyond it.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.480]   I go my way."
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   And then he puts it very plainly to them like this.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:47.720]   He says, "When you have lifted up, when he have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.840]   he know that I am he."
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.560]   What does this lifting up mean?
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.840]   Well, it means this.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   It means crucifixion.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   Crucifixion.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.240]   That's how they killed.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.640]   They took him in and they nailed him to a tree and they raised it up.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   A cross.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.560]   "When you have lifted me up," he says, "then you'll know."
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.820]   In other words, he's telling them beforehand that they were going to crucify him.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.760]   The very thing they did subsequently.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.000]   Well, my friends, I'm giving you my evidence very hurriedly tonight.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.500]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.360]   The obvious question is this, isn't it?
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.520]   Who is this?
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.320]   Who is it?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.680]   Who is this man apparently who ventures to speak like this?
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.200]   There's only one of two conclusions that you can come to.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:45.480]   Here is either a complete lunatic or here is the Son of God.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.200]   They're the only two possibilities.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.000]   This man, this ordinary man apparently, this carpenter I say, he stands up and he says
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   these things about himself.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.160]   He says, "I know where I've come from, I know where I'm going.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.080]   You are from beneath, I am from above.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.320]   You are of this world, I am not of this world.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.240]   My Father has sent me, gives me the words and the works.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.960]   You don't understand, I do.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.600]   And you are going to crucify me, but that's just my going my way.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:20.360]   I know exactly where I'm going and I know exactly what's going to happen to me."
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   He's a true prophet.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.960]   What he said happened.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.520]   They did the very thing.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   He knows it all.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   He sees it beforehand.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.160]   He's perfectly calm about it.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.520]   It's all plain to him.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.080]   My friend, have you ever faced these facts?
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.400]   Here is this person, Jesus of Nazareth, who belongs to history and to time.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.300]   And that is what he says about himself.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.680]   He says, "Follow me."
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.280]   And the one who's asking you to follow him tonight is one who said such things about
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.400]   himself.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.880]   Three thousand people believed on him on the day of Pentecost.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   What did they believe?
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   They believed that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.960]   They said he wasn't a mere man.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.000]   He was Son of God.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   We didn't believe it.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.680]   We were in the crowd that shouted away with him, "Crucify him."
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   We made a tragic blunder.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   It was awful.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   We were wrong.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.960]   He is the Son of God.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.160]   They believed.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.440]   They came to the light.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.640]   It is always the first step.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.320]   You've got to believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.040]   You believe in the Incarnation.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.360]   He's coming out of eternity into time, taking on to him human nature, the virgin birth,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:36.320]   the man, the God, the two in one, the divine human person, the Word of God, the Lord of
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   Glory.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.480]   It means that.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.760]   Before you follow him, you must know who he is.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.480]   At the moment you know who he is, you'll be already on your feet and ready to follow
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   him.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   But wait a minute.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   The second thing is this.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.720]   You must also believe and accept his teaching concerning the purpose of his coming into
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   this world.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.560]   "I know whence I came and whither I go."
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.800]   He has come into the world.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.160]   He's not of it.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   He's from above.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.680]   He's not of this world, but he's come down from above, from heaven, into this world.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   Why has he come?
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.720]   Well, I say you must believe that also, what he tells you about that.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.880]   And he's perfectly clear.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   What he says is this.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:22.440]   He tells us that he has been sent into this world by his Father.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.560]   "He that sent me," he says, "is true.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.360]   I am not alone, but I am the Father that sent me."
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.240]   And he keeps on saying that.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   Why is he in the world?
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.320]   Well, he's in the world because God the Father has sent him into this world.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.880]   And this is, of course, the heart of the gospel.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.800]   Why did God ever send him into the world?
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.520]   The answer is that he's got a work to perform.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.240]   He's come on a mission.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.400]   He's got a task.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.280]   You go again to chapter 17 of this gospel and read his high priestly prayer, and you'll
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:05.440]   find that he turns to his Father and he says, "Father, I have finished the work that thou
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.680]   gavest me to do."
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.280]   My dear friend, have you ever realized this?
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:22.120]   God the Eternal Father has sent his only Son into this world to perform a given, definite
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.320]   task.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.760]   He gave him a commission.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.480]   He sent him to do something in this world.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   And what is this?
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.160]   Well, listen to him.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.080]   He tells us that he has not been sent into the world to judge the world.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.640]   He says that quite plainly here.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:49.440]   He says here that he judged after the flesh.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.240]   I judge no man.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   What does he mean?
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.520]   He means this.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.080]   God didn't send him into the world to judge the world or to condemn the world.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.720]   That isn't the reason for his coming.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   And why not?
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.800]   Well, he's already told us in the third chapter.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   Listen to this.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.960]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.400]   should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.360]   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.640]   him might be saved.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:33.440]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.140]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.480]   Why has God not sent his Son into the world to condemn the world?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.000]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.880]   There was no need to do that.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   Why was there no need to do that?
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.760]   Because the world was already condemned, because the world is already under condemnation.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.880]   There was no need for the Son of God to come into the world to condemn it.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   Why?
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.800]   Well, I say the world is already condemned by the law of Moses, the law that God gave
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.400]   to Moses so long ago.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.680]   The world is condemned by the Ten Commandments.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.640]   Do we worship God and honor him?
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.200]   Do we live for him?
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.360]   Do we keep his laws?
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Are none of us guilty of all the things that are indicated in the Ten Commandments?
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   The answer is, "There is none, just no, not one.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.560]   The whole world lieth in evil, in the wicked one.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.840]   The whole world lieth guilty before God."
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:43.720]   But you know, even apart from the Ten Commandments which God gave to men through Moses' servants,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.080]   we all know from our consciences that we are already condemned.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.700]   We know we are evil and sinful.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.040]   We know we are unworthy and unclean.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.600]   The Son of God did not come into the world to judge and to condemn.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.320]   He says, "I judge no man."
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.240]   He hadn't left the courts of heaven and come into this world and humbled himself in order
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.640]   that he might condemn us all.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.080]   I say there was no need to.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   We are already in the dark.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.680]   We are already failures.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.020]   We are already sinners.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.200]   We are already condemned.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.040]   God's wrath is already upon us.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.640]   That's why the world as it is.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   Why did he come then?
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.720]   Well, he tells us he came to save.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.320]   God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.840]   might be saved.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.120]   And he says the same thing here himself.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.520]   He puts it like this, you see.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.720]   He said, "I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:40.080]   For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:47.560]   But you see, if you do believe that I am he, you shall not die in your sins."
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.920]   He has come into the world in order to save men.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.360]   That is his explicit, specific object in coming.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.840]   And this is the message I have to give you this evening.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.400]   That into the darkness of this world, which is the result of man's disobedience and
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.860]   sin, his original rebellion, and all that has followed from it, and all the consequences
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.880]   of that that he is reaping, God has sent his only Son into it, that we can be delivered
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.120]   from it.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.640]   That we needn't be participators in it any longer.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.200]   That we needn't go to the doom that is inevitably awaiting it.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.920]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.320]   And how does he do it?
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.040]   Well that's why he talks so much about his death, you see.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.600]   You remember how he had already said it in chapter three?
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.680]   You know this Gospel of John, it just goes on repeating itself chapter after chapter.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.800]   He said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.080]   man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   life."
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.840]   Moses lifted up the serpent.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.960]   Do you remember what happened?
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.920]   There was suddenly a plague of serpents and they bit the people and the people died.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.880]   And they were dying rapidly, one after another.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.520]   And God turned, Moses turned to God and said, "What can I do to stop this plague?"
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:24.000]   And God said, "Take and make a serpent out of a piece of brass, make a brazen serpent,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.160]   and then nail it to a pole and hold it up and say to the people, 'Every one of you
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.920]   that looks at that pole will be healed, and every man that looked at it was healed.'"
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:39.560]   Now then says this person, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:46.120]   must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   everlasting life."
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.520]   He says, "That's what I've come into this world.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.040]   I've come to die.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.800]   I've come to be crucified.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.320]   I've come to be lifted up."
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.760]   What's he mean?
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.360]   "Oh, he's the brazen serpent, as it were, in fulfillment."
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   What does he do?
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.960]   "Well, he takes the poison and the sting out of sin and all its consequences."
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   How?
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.480]   "By taking them upon himself.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.600]   The judgment of brass upon the serpent and the foulness and the venom.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   He is this.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.920]   He is the great antitype of that type."
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.200]   He is referring to his death.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:27.400]   That's what he meant when he said, "I go my way when you have lifted me up.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.000]   I know where I'm going.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.600]   Yes, I've come into this world not to stay here, not just to die out of it.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.800]   I've come to die in a very special way.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.200]   I came into the world for this hour that's coming.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.120]   I have come to taste death for every man that believes in me.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.920]   I have come to bear their sins.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.000]   I've come to be the brazen serpent.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.960]   I've come to be held up on a pole.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   I've come that men looking at me might be delivered from the consequences of sin and
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.920]   evil, that they might be forgiven, that they might be absolved, that they might be reconciled
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.120]   to God, that the gate of heaven might be opened to them."
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.000]   That's what he says.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.840]   That is his teaching.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.280]   That is his explanation of the purpose of his coming.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.720]   God so loved the world that he gave, sent his only begotten Son into it, that whosoever
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:23.440]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.840]   Have your sins forgiven.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.760]   Become reconciled to God.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.560]   Know that you're a child of God.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.840]   Lose the fear of death and the grave.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.920]   Know that when you die you go on to be with Christ, which is far better, and that you
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.200]   shall spend your eternity in a glory that baffles description.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.920]   With God and with Christ, oh, the holiness and the wonder of it all.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   You know that.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.240]   That's what he's come to give us.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:43:00.920]   Not perish, but have everlasting, eternal life.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:08.320]   You must believe that, that he is the Son of God, and that he came into the world in
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.920]   order to do that for you, to die your death, to take the punishment of your guilt, to reconcile
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.920]   you to God.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.880]   The three thousand on the day of Pentecost, they believed it.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.840]   "This I cried out, saying, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.480]   And the answer came back from Peter as the voice of thunder, 'Repent, every one of
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:32.440]   you, and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sins.'"
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   That's the answer.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.840]   Believe that he is the Lord.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.360]   Believe that it is through him alone that you can have remission of sins.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.520]   And the last thing, obviously you must act on it.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.600]   You must do something about it.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.200]   That's why he puts it here in terms of following me.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.000]   I am the light of the world.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.240]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   What does it mean?
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.640]   Well, you see, you must act upon this.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.840]   It isn't enough to say, "I believe what you're saying.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.000]   I accept it all."
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   But that's intellectual.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.080]   "My dear friend, you've got to follow him.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   This is essential.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.600]   You've got to do something.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   You don't sit back and just believe this and go on as you were.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   No, no.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.360]   He's going to lead you out of the darkness, and you've got to follow him.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.680]   You've got to go where he is.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.960]   And if you do that, he says, "You shall no longer walk in darkness, but you shall
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.080]   have the light of life."
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.200]   There is action involved.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.880]   You hear the offer.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.640]   What you do, well, you believe it.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   What does that involve?
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.160]   Well, clearly the first thing it involves is this.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.920]   You've got to repent.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.960]   Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.600]   What is repentance?
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:48.400]   Repentance is an acknowledgement of the truth of what the Bible says about you as a sinner.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.760]   You believe this testimony which tells you that you have sinned against God, that you
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.640]   deserve no love, you deserve nothing but hell.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.600]   You've sinned in practice, in actions.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.840]   Your nature is sinful.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.160]   You're by nature a hater of God.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.360]   You believe that.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   You acknowledge it.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   You say, "It's right.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   It's true."
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   You confess it.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.800]   That's repentance, admission that the Bible diagnoses of you and your condition is the
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.680]   simple absolute truth.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.800]   You stop saying, "Ah, but this is insulting.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.800]   I'm a good fellow.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.040]   I've never done any wrong.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.440]   I've always tried to live a good life."
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   You stop saying that.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.280]   For as long as you say that, you have not repented.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.840]   The man who repents is the man like our Lord's picture of that publican who went up at the
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.200]   same time as the Pharisee to pray in the temple, and he was so conscious of his sin, he's there
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.880]   at the back beating his breast.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.880]   He dare not even look up.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.720]   He says, "God, have mercy upon me, a sinner."
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.840]   Have you realized that you're a sinner?
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.600]   Have you acknowledged and confessed your sin to God?
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.120]   That you haven't lived for his glory, that you haven't worshipped him, that you've spat
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.880]   upon his commandments, you've broken them, you've delighted in your own will, you've
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.680]   been proud of yourself and your own efforts and your own understanding, you've been a
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.280]   man of the world, this world, and you've gloried in it and laughed at this and have said, "Away
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.720]   with that Christ," like these people had said before the day of Pentecost.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.240]   But have you seen how wrong it's all been?
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.120]   Have you repented, my friend?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.280]   Have you gone into God's presence and said, "God, I'm not worthy to come before you.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.080]   I realize I deserve nothing, but you cast out of thy presence for all eternity.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:32.000]   I richly deserve hell for my pride, my conceit, my vileness, my foulness, my evil nature,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.400]   my wrong deeds."
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   Have you repented?
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.880]   It's involved in following him.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.520]   It's an admission that you've been all wrong and that what he says is right.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:47.560]   He says, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.000]   Have you admitted to him that you're lost, that you don't know where you are and you
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.800]   don't know what to do, you don't know how to live and you don't know how to die?
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.560]   Have you ever said to him, "Lord, you're right, I'm lost.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.280]   I'm hopelessly lost.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   I'm helpless."
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.840]   Have you told him that that's to repent?
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:11.200]   Admission, confession of sin, being convicted of the truth of this Word about yourself as
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.400]   you are by nature.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   Repentance and then acceptance of him and his teaching.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.360]   In your utter hopelessness and self-despair, you turn to him and say, "Christ, I believe
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.640]   your Word.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.200]   I believe you are the Son of God.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.880]   I see how wrong I've been with my folly and my attempted understanding.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   I see that you are the Son of God.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.760]   I believe what you say about yourself.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.600]   I believe what you say about your mission.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.680]   I believe you have died even for me.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.280]   I can't understand it because I didn't deserve it.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.600]   But you've done it, I believe it, that your love is so glorious that you loved even me
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.760]   and have given yourself.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.840]   I believe it.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.880]   I cast myself at thy feet.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.960]   I accept your offer.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.680]   I believe it's my only hope that you've died for me and therefore that God forgives me.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.720]   I thank you."
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:14.400]   And then obviously, seeing this and believing it, you say, "I'm not going on living any
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.560]   longer as I've been.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:23.080]   You have said rightly that I am of this world and that I'm from beneath and you're right.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.640]   I've been living for the world.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.920]   I've been chasing its prices.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:31.280]   I've been going after its glittering bubbles, its vanities.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.840]   I've been saying it's wonderful and I've been laughing at Christian people and saying,
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.120]   'Oh, how sad that they still believe that old fairy tale.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.240]   I was taught it in the Sunday school, but the moment I became an adolescent I gave up
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   such nonsense.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:49.520]   I see that it's right, it's true, I'm going to live it.'"
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:49:00.280]   "Jesus, I, my cross, have taken all to leave and follow thee, destitute, despised, forsaken.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.480]   Thou from hence my all shall be.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.640]   Perish every fond ambition, all I've thought and hoped and known.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.480]   Yet how rich is my condition, God, and heaven is still mine own."
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.040]   Yes, if you're to follow him, if you want this light, the light of life, if you want
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.600]   to get out of the darkness and get the darkness out of yourself, you've got to follow him.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.080]   And it means turning your back upon the world and all its sin and all its vileness and ugliness
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   and foulness, you get up out of it.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   And whatever the cost, you go after him.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.440]   You listen to his teaching.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   These three thousand on the day of Pentecost, they continued steadfastly in the apostles'
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.320]   doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayer.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.720]   And if you want to have the light of life, you've got to come out of that world, leave
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   it and all that belongs to it.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.520]   Come into the Christian church, follow Christ, get hold of the doctrine, enlighten it, read
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:08.040]   it, understand it, masticate it, share fellowship with Christian people.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:14.080]   Remember the Lord's death and live a life of prayer.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:22.240]   He that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.240]   That's your choice.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:29.160]   Go on living in the world and you'll go on in darkness and you'll die in a final despair
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.400]   and you'll spend eternity in the darkness of hell.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.200]   Come out of it.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.680]   See who he is.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.720]   See what he's done for you.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   See his love.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   Get up.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.120]   Thank him, having fallen at his feet in utter penitence and contrition.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.440]   Rise up and follow him.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.440]   Deny yourself.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.920]   Take up your cross.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   What does that mean?
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.480]   Well, it may mean this, you see, that your own nearest and dearest will say that you're
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.200]   a fool, that you've gone mad.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.880]   It'll mean having the scorn of the people in the office or in the works or in the profession.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   That's taking up your cross.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.520]   Let them say what they like.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   It doesn't matter.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.160]   He is son of God and he's died to deliver me, that I shouldn't perish.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.080]   I'm going after him.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.120]   It means that you desire to please him, that you really are going to live from now on for
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:24.760]   his glory, for his namesake, submitting to his teaching, seeking his guidance, receiving
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:31.520]   his spirit, looking to him for all you need, and living, I say, with all your might and
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:40.320]   main to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:49.840]   I almost feel that it would be insulting your intelligence to plead with you.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:55.480]   If you realize that you're in the darkness and that you can never get yourself out of
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:03.720]   it, if you really see and believe that God has sent his only son into this world to deliver
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:10.560]   you from it, and that that blessed person even went to the extent of dying the cruel
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:17.040]   death on a cross that you might be delivered, if you really believe that and if you believe
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.400]   further that he can lead you into a life of glory, out of the darkness, into the light,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:32.880]   out of shame, into happiness and joy, from hell to heaven and eventual perfect bliss,
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.320]   a man who rarely sees that and believes it, doesn't need me nor anybody else to cajole
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.360]   him or to bring pressure upon him and upon his will and to try to hypnotize him.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.360]   No, no.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.240]   If you see it, that you're hellbound and hell-deserving, but that God has so loved
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:58.400]   you as to send his only begotten son to deliver you, you will leave that world and you'll
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.840]   be glad to do so as soon as possible.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:09.680]   And you'll rise up and you'll follow Jesus Christ.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.520]   He'll lead you through life, he'll lead you through death.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   He will lead you into the presence of his Father and present you before him, the presence
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:28.600]   of his glory, with exceeding joy.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:37.760]   Three thousand people saw that on that first day of Pentecost.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:43.200]   Have you seen it on this day of Pentecost?
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.360]   This White Sunday, have you seen it?
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:55.480]   If you have and if you've told him so and if you tell him so now and give yourself to
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:54:00.760]   him and follow him, you'll no longer walk in the darkness.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.300]   You'll have an entirely new life.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.960]   You will have the light of life.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.680]   You will know your sins forgiven.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.440]   You'll know you're a child of God.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:16.840]   You'll understand the course of future history in this sinful world.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.440]   You'll give up your illusions.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.600]   You'll stop listening to the false prophets.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.040]   You will know that the world is doomed and under condemnation and that a terrible end
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.640]   is coming to it.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.080]   But you will know that you are safe, that you've already passed from judgment into life
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:42.400]   and you'll begin to look forward to that eternity of glory that is reserved for the children
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.440]   of God.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.920]   Amen.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:51.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
