[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.520]   - Pastor John, I know you appreciate Dorothy Sayers
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.860]   and what she has to say about vocation.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.560]   In the next few moments, would you share with us
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.060]   a little bit about what you have learned
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.560]   from her about work?
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   - Dorothy Sayers died in 1957,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   and when I was a senior in college in 1968,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.960]   I think it was February, I read her book,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   "Mind of the Maker," and was riveted by it.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.440]   I had fallen in love with language and writing
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.260]   when I was in the 11th grade,
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.280]   and now I'm a senior in college,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.880]   and I read this book about the connection
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.800]   between God's mind and God's Trinitarian nature
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   and God's creativity in making the world
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.560]   and making us in his image,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.560]   and then our being co-creators with him, makers.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.120]   And the more I thought about it,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.360]   and then just recently thinking about it again,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   the more amazing it is to me that we have been both made
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.120]   and remade in Christ to be makers.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.560]   In other words, when God put Adam and Eve in the garden,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.980]   he put them there to take what he had made,
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.700]   they don't create out of nothing,
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.280]   and then create something out of it,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.120]   make something good and beautiful and useful out of it.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   And then we lost our capacities to serve righteousness
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.000]   and he's remaking us, and then you get to Ephesians 2,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.640]   and we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.840]   for good works.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.240]   And then I did a little thinking and poking around
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.560]   and noticed that the Greek word for do
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.360]   is the same word as make,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480]   ploieo, from which we get the word poem,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   and God, we are his workmanship,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.960]   is the word for poem or made one.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   And it just hit me that virtually everything we do in life
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.280]   is the making of something into something else.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.680]   We make something happen or we make something last,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.760]   or we make something into something else.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   We make a rocky field into a garden
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.840]   or a stick into a spear,
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080]   or a rock into a hammer,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880]   or a room, an empty apartment into a home,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.920]   we make a cow into a steak,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.240]   and the list just goes on and on
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.360]   so that people, I think,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.760]   just be really, really good for Christians
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   to think of themselves as being made the first time
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   and remade as people who are makers with God.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   They are called to take what God has made
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.800]   in all of its now present fallenness
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.720]   and remake it into something Godward and beautiful
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920]   and Christ-honoring as a deep sense of fulfillment
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   of who we are as created in the image of a maker.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.040]   That was the gist behind Dorothy Sare's
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.080]   mind of the maker.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.000]   And to this day, I'm very inspired.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.840]   And even as I head into retirement time,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   which I hope isn't retirement,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.920]   I'll be a more effective, aggressive,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.320]   Christ-honoring maker than I ever have been.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.000]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John,
