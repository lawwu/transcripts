[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   - You say 10X is easier than 2X.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Help people understand how that's actually possible.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.500]   - A 2X mindset means that you're taking the past
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.800]   and the present, and you're using that foundation
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.920]   to build the future.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.800]   It's very linear, and basically what it means
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.260]   is that to go 2X, you're just usually just doing more
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.160]   of what you already have.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.800]   A 10X mindset's the opposite.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.880]   A 10X mindset starts with the future,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880]   and it even scales it so high that it feels impossible,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.960]   literally impossible.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.980]   So I know that you asked the question,
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.260]   how are you saying that this is easier?
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.960]   Now I'm gonna actually say it's literally impossible.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.680]   But you take the future and you scale it
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.160]   to such a high view that it feels impossible,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.720]   and then rather than letting the present shape the future,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.640]   you're now actually letting the future shape the present.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.320]   You're letting the future determine who you are
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.360]   and what you do in the present.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   In other words, I'm letting my future self
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   determine who I am in the present.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.720]   I'm not letting my present self
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.560]   determine who my future self will be.
