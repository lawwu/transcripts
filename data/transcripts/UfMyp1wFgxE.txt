[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:26.160]   My granddad was a soldier on the front in '41.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.040]   The bullets took his brother.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.480]   This stubborn love held on.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.040]   The sky was filled with fire.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.520]   Millions lost in flames.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.760]   Hate and love were all there.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   The world never the same.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.760]   Some days will sink in sadness.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.120]   The weight of them too tough.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.560]   Don't lose yourself to madness.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.640]   The way out is love.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.840]   When New York towers crumble, we're all New Yorkers too.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.800]   For a moment all just human, at the same old red or blue.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.120]   And the wicked will go on scheming
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.520]   for the power and the pain.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.400]   But the heart that longs for freedom
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.320]   is a fire they'll never tame.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.040]   Some days will sink in sadness.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.320]   The weight of them too tough.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.760]   Don't lose yourself to madness.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   The way out is love.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.400]   [MUSIC - THE BULLETS TOOK HIS BROTHER]
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   The virus took a comfort that was never ours to own.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.840]   When the enemy is inside us, we're together but alone.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.800]   This life is so dim and fragile, a leaf caught in the wind.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.640]   But every breath that's tragic ignites a hope within.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.240]   Some days will sink in sadness.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.640]   The weight of them too tough.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   Don't lose yourself to madness.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.480]   The way out is love.
