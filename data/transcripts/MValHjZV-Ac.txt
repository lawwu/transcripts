[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   How do I overcome my fear of the future?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's an ancient question for God's people who have always been
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   tempted to worry about the unknowns. God knows
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   that we struggle here, and overcoming this fear is a matter of getting a
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   right view of God and of his providence over every detail of our
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   lives. Pastor John explained why in a 1993 sermon on
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Isaiah 41 verses 1-13, and I want to
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   read that full text before we hear from Pastor John. The Lord speaks
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   in chapter 41 saying this, "Listen to me in
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   silence, O coastlands. Let the peoples renew their strength.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Let them approach, then let them speak. Let us together draw near
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   for judgment. Who stirred up one from the east, whom victory
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   meets at every step? He gives up nations before him, so that he
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   tramples kings underfoot. He makes them like dust with his sword, like driven
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   stubble with his bow. He pursues them and passes on safely
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   by paths his feet have not trod. Who has performed
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and done this, calling the generations from the beginning?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I the Lord, the first and with the last I am
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   he. The coastlands have seen and are afraid. The ends
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   of the earth tremble. They have drawn near and come. Everyone helps his neighbor
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and says to his brother, 'Be strong.' The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and he who smooths with the hammer, him who strikes the anvil,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   saying of the soldering, 'It is good,' and they strengthen it with
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   nails, so that it cannot be moved. But you, O Israel,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   my servant Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Abraham my friend, you whom I took from the ends of the
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   earth and called from its farthest corners, saying to you,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   'You are my servant. I have chosen
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   you and not cast you off. Fear not, for I am with
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   you. Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   you. I will help you. I will uphold you with my right
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   hand.' Behold, all who are incensed
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   against you shall be put to shame and confounded. Those who
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish. You shall
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Those who war against you shall be as nothing
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   at all. For I, the Lord your God, hold your right
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   hand. It is I who say to you, 'Fear not.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I am the one who helps you.'"
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Here's Pastor John expounding on this text in 1993.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now I say that those four glimpses
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   intensify the five pillars of fearlessness in
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Isaiah 41.10. Let me try to put it all together for you.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   The God who judges all the earth and calls the coastlands to give an
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   account, the God who rules over the rulers of the nations,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   the God who calls the nations into being, the God who calls
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   his people from the nations and elects them for himself, that
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   God says to you this morning, "I am your God. I am with
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   you. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   up with my victorious right hand."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And only now does he say, "Therefore,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   therefore, because I judge the nations,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   therefore, because I rule the rulers, therefore, because I
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   call nations into being, therefore, because I choose my own
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   freely, therefore, because I am your God, therefore, because
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I am with you, therefore, because I help you, therefore, because I strengthen
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   you, therefore, because I uphold you, therefore, for the rest of
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   your life, do not be afraid."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It isn't hanging in the air
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   as a burden. It's a doorway
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   into a life of freedom on
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   massive pillars of divine enablement.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Let me change the image.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   If I may, God, please, get it home to you.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Try five prepositions
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   or five spatial relationships that
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   God has to you. "I am your God."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That is, "I am above you. I am over you
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   with my mighty hand." Over. "I am with you."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Beside. "I will
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   help you from whatever angle the enemy may come or the attack
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   or the threat. I am all around you as your help.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I will strengthen you from inside out. I will be your
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   strength, and I will uphold you from underneath
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   you. I am over you. I am beside
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   you. I am all around you. I am inside
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of you. I am under you. You don't need a fear.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You don't need to be afraid.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Choose your image. Do not be afraid.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   There is one great
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   ground for fearlessness.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   God, I am your God.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I will be with you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I will strengthen you.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I will help you. I will
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   uphold you. I only have one message.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   If you have God, you don't need to be afraid.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And I call you this morning
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   to believe that the most
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   crucial factor in the
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   future of your fearlessness is not your
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   family of origin. It is
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   your God. I
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   call you to be free from the
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   limitations that so many put upon yourself
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   in a kind of fatalistic rootedness in
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   where you've come from. You have a God
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   who is infinitely more powerful
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   than anything in your past.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And He can break whatever
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   bondages you feel to be in because of it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The Bible holds up a God who is
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   stronger than your personality. Who is
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   stronger than your past track record of timidity.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Who is stronger than your perceived
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   identity as a nobody who could ever accomplish
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   anything with courage for God. And I plead with
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   you to accept the fact that it is God who makes the
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   difference and not you or your parents or your friends.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It is God who makes the difference. I just appeal
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to the one among you right now who feels absolutely
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and totally inadequate to do anything of worth this week.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I appeal to you to stop thinking about
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   your inadequacy and why you got to be that way.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And I plead with you to look at God.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He is God. He is God.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Do you believe Him? Jesus said, "Let not
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   your hearts be troubled. Believe
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   in God." Amen.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   That was from Pastor John's sermon on Isaiah 41 verses 1-13 titled
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   "Fear Not, I Am With You, I Am Your God."
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Preached on June 20th, 1993.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The full message is available right now free of charge at DesiringGod.org
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This is a clip I like, one I found while listening to Pastor John's
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   sermons and if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John's, send it to me. Give me the title
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   of the sermon and the timestamps from the audio of when the clip
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   begins and ends. Tell me why it's impacted you. And then give me
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   your name, the closest city to you, and email me all of that information at
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's our email address.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. And put the word "clip" in the subject
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   line, please, if you would. I would appreciate it.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, why is the Bible so violent?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It is violent. Very violent. So violent that one listener wants to know
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   why. Why must it be so violent?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's an important question with an answer that every Christian needs to know and understand and be equipped
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   with. Don't miss it. That's on Friday. I'm your host Tony Rehnke and we will
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   see you then. Thanks for listening.
