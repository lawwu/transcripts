[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.240]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the mortgage market and specifically mortgage
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.580]   market abnormalities.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.800]   The number one economic indicator or financial indicator I like to track is the 10-year bond
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   yield.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.200]   The 10-year bond yield tells you a lot of things.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.280]   You can write books about what the 10-year bond yield is saying.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.920]   And after the election results on November 7, we saw that the 10-year bond yield spiked
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.160]   higher to about 0.97%.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   But in actuality, the 10-year bond yield has been rising steadily from a bottom of around
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.540]   0.51% in early August to about 0.85% up until the election results.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.940]   And concurrently, what's been happening is that the average 30-year mortgage rate has
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.600]   been going down while that 10-year bond yield had been going up.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.240]   At first, I was thinking to myself, this must be a mortgage market anomaly.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.680]   You know, there's a kink in the system.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   It'll right itself eventually.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.600]   But after about three months of this disconnect, it's clear that something's going on with
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960]   the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.820]   And we need to get to the bottom of it.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.520]   The other mortgage market anomaly is that the average 15-year mortgage rate is way below
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.840]   the average 5.1 arm rate.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.440]   We're talking 50 basis points or a half a percentage points lower than the 5.1 average
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.680]   rate.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   And this generally doesn't happen because longer-term duration loans charge higher rates.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.600]   It's just like if your buddy were to ask you to borrow $20 and if he pays you back tomorrow,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.240]   you won't charge him an interest rate.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.900]   But if he says, I want to borrow $100,000, which you're probably not going to lend him
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.620]   over a 30-year period of time, you're certainly going to demand a higher rate because inflation
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.640]   is going to eat up the value of the dollar.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.540]   So based on the time value of money, longer-term duration loans charge higher rates.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.760]   And with the 15-year fixed, generally, a 15-year fixed mortgage is more expensive than a 5.1
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.240]   arm or a 7.1 arm or a 10.1 arm, right?
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.920]   Because the arms are shorter duration loans.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.160]   So the question the intellectually curious should ask is, why did the average 30-year
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.760]   fixed rate decline when bond yields went up?
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.560]   The simple answer is that banks were more able to lend once they got through a tremendous
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.080]   refinance backlog and hired more people.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.760]   When the pandemic hit in March 2020, lending standards tightened tremendously.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.720]   A lot of the bankers were thinking, uh-oh, this is back to 2008, 2009 financial crisis.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.880]   Our loan book is going to get hit.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   There's going to be defaults and so forth.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   So the lenders and the underwriters were like, well, OK, we're going to take our time.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.780]   We're only going to lend to the highest credit-worthy borrowers.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.160]   And refinances took weeks, if not months, longer than normal to close.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600]   About a month after the lockdowns began, I got pre-approved for a mortgage.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.840]   But instead of taking one to two weeks, it took four-plus weeks.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.500]   And it's just because things were all backlogged.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.400]   At the same time, demand to refinance skyrocketed, given rates fell by over 1% in just one or
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.460]   two months.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.840]   So many lenders found themselves short-staffed.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.040]   And they began aggressively trying to hire to meet the increase in demand.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   And so the finance industry is very cyclical in nature.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.480]   It's kind of boom and bust.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.660]   And you can never really time it right.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.000]   And so managers are trying to smooth out the cycles by having the right amount of staff.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.240]   But in this case, it was quite a shock.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.120]   Given it takes time to hire people and train people to help dampen the demand volume, lenders
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.420]   decided to charge a higher spread over an index.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.880]   And that index is usually LIBOR.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.640]   So instead of charging just 2% above LIBOR, lenders began charging 2.25% or 2.5% above
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   LIBOR.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.920]   This is all about demand management here.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.360]   And by charging a higher spread, banks can therefore earn a higher profit margin on the
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.880]   loans that they do close.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   So banks that found themselves more undermanned than others rationally charged higher mortgage
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   rates.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.880]   And as a result, consumers had to diligently shop around to get the best rate.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.120]   So what's going on today?
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.440]   Well, lenders have more capacity to handle refinances and purchase loans because demand
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.800]   has subsided and more people are employed to handle the workload.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.400]   I spoke to my mortgage officer the other day and he said those people who wanted to refinance
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   have already refinanced.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.000]   And he said he was focusing more on purchase loans going into 2021 and beyond.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.880]   So as a result, given more capacity, lenders are now charging lower spreads to help boost
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.280]   business once more.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.560]   Again, it was a pull forward of a lot of refinancing earlier in 2020.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   And now 2020 second half compared to 2020 first half is looking pretty light.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.400]   It's probably going to be, I would think, down half over half.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.440]   So businesses, banks, they're trying to balance out the cycle and smooth out their earnings
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.840]   and their business numbers.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.040]   So they're now lowering rates because they have more capacity.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.680]   So the lesson here is just because the 10-year bond yield is going up, it doesn't mean the
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.080]   30-year mortgage rate is going up in exact correlation.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.280]   In fact, it could be flat or go down, which is why it's important to not only pay attention
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.120]   to the 10-year bond yield, but also to diligently check the latest mortgage rates when it comes
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.680]   time for you to refinance because, let's say, your arm is resetting or it's time for you
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.120]   to buy a house.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   Don't just rely on one indicator.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.480]   You've got to diligently check and cross-reference.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.160]   So the next question we should all ask is why is the average 15-year mortgage rate lower
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.320]   than the average 5-1 arm?
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.040]   I've been a big proponent of getting an arm over a 30-year fixed for a very, very long
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.360]   time because I believe interest rates are going to stay low for a very long time.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.840]   You look back to mortgage rate trends since the late 1980s, and it's been coming down.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.480]   And I think it's going to stay down because the market is much more efficient.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.640]   We've got technology.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   We've learned through many cycles.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.600]   Therefore, we have successfully tamed inflation.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.200]   And therefore, there's no reason to really jack up interest rates.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.760]   The reason why the average 15-year mortgage rate has been lower than the average 5-1 arm
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.360]   rate is because we're still in times of great uncertainty.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.980]   Banks are still being cautious about the amount of money they lend, the duration of each loan,
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.480]   and who they lend money to.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.440]   Yes, it's better than the first half of 2020, but still, banks are quite cautious.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.640]   From a bank's perspective, a 15-year fixed rate mortgage is less risky because the bank
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   gets paid back a larger amount each month in a shorter period of time.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   It's a 15-year amortizing loan versus a 30-year amortizing loan.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.600]   At the same time, borrower demand for 30-year amortizing loans, which are 30-year fixed
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.120]   rate mortgages and arms, is higher because borrowers want maximum flexibility and lower
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.240]   monthly payments during times of uncertainty.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.540]   So with higher borrower demand for a 30-year amortizing loan, banks can logically charge
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.480]   higher spreads to earn a higher risk-adjusted profit.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   Therefore, to entice mortgage borrowers to get a 15-year fixed rate mortgage, banks are
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.320]   willing to charge a lower spread and therefore a lower mortgage rate.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.840]   For those of you looking to refinance or buy a home in the wintertime or in the upcoming
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.560]   months, if you can get a lower mortgage rate and pay down your mortgage quicker, it's not
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.960]   a bad idea.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.520]   This is especially true if you're like me and regularly pay down extra principal anyway.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.240]   The cash flow is not that big of a deal.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.120]   As a homeowner, you're really optimizing for the lowest interest rate possible.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.460]   Just make sure that before you do take out a 15-year fixed rate mortgage, you can comfortably
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.060]   afford the higher mortgage payments due to a shorter amortization period.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.240]   My 30/30/3 home buying rule dictates that you should spend no more than 30% of your
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.400]   monthly gross income on your living expenses.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.540]   Therefore, if you can do that, you should be good to go.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:17.460]   So if you are in for a mortgage right now, the action step to take is to check online.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:24.060]   You can go to financialsamurai.com/credible to get free real mortgage rate quotes.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.940]   And you should go and talk to your banker.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.340]   Shoot him or her an email or give them a call and ask what are the mortgage rates for 30-year
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.500]   fixed, 15-year arm, and various arm products.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.540]   Hopefully you will find that the 15-year mortgage rate is lower than all others.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.720]   I would probably go with that rate right now.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.380]   It is the lowest rate with the widest spread I've ever seen.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.980]   And I think you're going to feel good getting that lowest rate and paying off your mortgage
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980]   quicker.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.540]   I've never regretted paying off my mortgage and I don't think you will either.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.060]   The next step is to think about the future.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.940]   If you're not looking to refinance or buy a home now, you've got to think about where
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.260]   you think mortgage rates will go.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.980]   I personally do not believe that mortgage rates will skyrocket or increase much further
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.820]   than where we are right now, especially as we go into winter and the coronavirus count
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.140]   ticks up and lockdowns start happening nationwide.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.700]   I truly do believe there's going to be more lockdowns over the next two or three months.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.860]   The vaccine, although phenomenal news, is not going to be available until what, April
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.500]   or May or maybe later.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.580]   So you just can't really count on that.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.100]   But in the meantime, I think a lot of people are just getting a lot more relaxed.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.580]   And as a result, the case counts are just going out of control again.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.460]   And it's going to breach the records we saw this summer, unfortunately.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.220]   However, after the first quarter of 2021, things are probably going to start feeling
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.540]   a little bit better.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.160]   We've gone through the worst of winter and there will have probably been a massive amount
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.540]   of positive vaccine news from all sorts of companies.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.860]   And if they can't get it right, well, I mean, Pfizer can just, I'm assuming, give their
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.700]   formula to other vaccine manufacturers and help them pump out large quantities for the
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.460]   entire population.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:14.660]   And therefore, we could enter a scenario where there is a raging bull market in 2021.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.040]   Goldman Sachs, for example, is incredibly bullish on the future.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.620]   They have a year-end target for 2020 of $3,700.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.580]   That's an upgrade from $3,600.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.540]   And they have a year-end 2021 target of $4,300 for the S&P 500.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.420]   Now that's a 20% rise from current levels.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.260]   So the S&P 500 does indeed go up by 20% from here.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.180]   I am pretty sure mortgage rates are going to take higher.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.620]   I don't think they're going to go way higher.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:49.560]   But instead of seeing a 2.85% 30-year fixed rate mortgage, you might see a 3.875%.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.860]   Not bad, but it's still relatively higher than it is right now.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.740]   Therefore, if you are very bullish about the economy in 2021, you should probably refinance
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.180]   now because rates are probably going to go higher.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.880]   And higher rates isn't necessarily bad at all.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.580]   I'm sure we'd all gladly accept higher mortgage rates if our stock portfolios and real estate
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.700]   holdings both rise by another 10% to 20%.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700]   I know I would.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.780]   But wouldn't it be even better to lock in lower mortgage rates today and then see our
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.700]   investments increase so much in value as well?
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.580]   I certainly would prefer the latter.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.900]   Whatever happens, I'm thankful we all have options.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.140]   We have an option to choose a 15-year fixed rate mortgage because it's currently trading
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.900]   way below average.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.860]   I'm also thankful that the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage isn't going up as quickly
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.020]   as the 10-year bond yield.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.660]   And I'm also really thankful that there's vaccine news.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.780]   Oh my goodness, Pfizer coming out with a 90% efficacy.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.820]   That compares really favorably to the flu shot vaccine, which has something like a 50%
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.860]   to 60% efficacy rate.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.860]   And the FDA approval minimum rate is 50%.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.580]   So 90% is just hitting a grand slam.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.300]   It is great.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.360]   And hopefully you're going to see more news from Marderna, Eli Lilly, and a whole bunch
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.780]   of other vaccine companies.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.620]   So things are looking up.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.920]   The stock market is doing well.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.540]   Rates continue to stay low, although they're inching higher.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.820]   Real estate continuing to do well.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.580]   But we've got to buckle down this winter so we could live long enough and survive long
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.180]   enough to get these vaccines, these safe vaccines, hopefully.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.340]   So before the lockdowns occur, I suggest going for a walk, going to the parks, going to the
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.540]   outdoors, playing some sports, and staying safe, because it could be a long winter.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540]   But I'm prepared.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.500]   And hopefully all of us are prepared, and good things will happen in the future.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.940]   Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.820]   If you want to discuss more about mortgage market abnormalities, come hop over to the
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820]   post.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.460]   I've got a couple of cool charts, and we can discuss the future, mortgage rates, stock
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.780]   market, whatever you want.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.020]   And if you found value in this episode, please, I'd love a positive review.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.980]   It keeps me motivated and helps keep me going.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.220]   I think the last time recorded was more than 20 days ago, because I've just been focusing
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.220]   on other stuff.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.420]   But the more positive reviews I get, the more I'll record, and the more I'll invite my wife
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.020]   to talk about interesting subjects that can help us all.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.660]   Stay safe, everyone.
