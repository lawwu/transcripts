[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Well, how do I kill the pride inside me?
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.680]   Pride is a nefarious enemy, one of our great enemies, and one of God's ancient enemies.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.800]   And yet, when the Lord gifts someone with natural skills and abilities beyond the norm,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.260]   that struggle with pride can become even more intense.
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.900]   As we begin a new week on Ask Pastor John, our next question arises from a young woman
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800]   who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.440]   A pleasant good day to you, Pastor John.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.000]   I'm so grateful for your ministry.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.280]   It has immensely contributed to my spiritual development.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.000]   I am a law student from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.560]   I love the Lord with all my heart and desire to do many exploits for the kingdom of God.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.360]   However, I have one big problem, and I think it's hindering my effectiveness as a disciple
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.720]   of Christ.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.520]   I have a deep-rooted issue with pride.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.680]   I know it is a sin, and I've tried many times to deal with this problem, but it always seems
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920]   to hide and then resurface.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.120]   I have been called condescending by my peers and family.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.040]   I am verbally aggressive.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.520]   What steps can I take daily to kill the sin of my expressive pride?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.840]   I wish I knew you better.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.880]   I don't even know your name.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.320]   I sure love your candor, and I think it's a great work of grace that you can even see
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.680]   and identify those things about pride, because you're certainly not the only one.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.880]   If I knew you better, I would try to tailor this response to your particular kind of pride,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.080]   if I understood it better.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.000]   Everybody deals with pride.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.940]   Not everybody knows it, because pride takes such subtle forms, but we all do.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.160]   So I wish I knew better.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.600]   But you give me some clues, so let me make a stab at what might be helpful.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.440]   I pray, God, that it will help you and others, because pride is universal.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.680]   Let me commend this way of battling pride, namely, a close look at the way God saved
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.720]   you.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.400]   A close look, a repeated, regular attention to the way God saved you.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.280]   He saved you in a way that no matter how you look at it, if you look at it biblically,
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.160]   it was designed to humble you and destroy your pride.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.760]   That's the way you were saved.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.600]   So what you need, and all of us need, is not some teaching that comes later, like at a
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320]   mature stage of Christianity.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   What you need is to know and to feel the implications of how God saved you.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Millions of Christians do not know how God saved them.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.440]   That may sound strange, like you could be saved and not know how.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.800]   That's right.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.760]   Many people don't—they haven't been taught accurately what the Bible says about what
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.200]   God did to save them, either in history or by the Spirit in their lives.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.920]   And therefore, they have been deprived of the power of this truth to work a deep humility
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.520]   and great boldness—deep humility, great boldness—in their lives.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.880]   Many Christians think they themselves were the decisive cause of their own conversion
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   to Christ.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.120]   They've been taught that.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.200]   And that God was merely a responder, not sovereign, not a sovereign Savior.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.680]   Let's look at reality.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.960]   First, there's the reality of sin that we have to be saved from.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   It's more profound and more terrible than anyone realizes.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.000]   I mean anyone.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.080]   The entire Old Testament is written to show us the dreadful power of sin and the utter
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.720]   hopelessness of even the people of God without the omnipotence of God's saving grace to
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.520]   convert them to Christ.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.120]   So here's Romans 3:19.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.280]   Now we know that whatever the law says—and I think he's referring to the whole Old Testament,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.520]   not just the first five books.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.960]   You can read why in the context.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   Whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.960]   in the universe may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.400]   We were utterly helpless to free ourselves from the blindness and the bondage of sin.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.920]   And Paul says we could not see it.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.520]   We couldn't see the glory of Christ.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.760]   We could not bring ourselves to life from death.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.200]   Romans 8, 5-7, 1 Corinthians 2, 14, 2 Corinthians 4, 4.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.520]   God appointed faith as a way, the only way of salvation.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.680]   And this way, namely the way of faith, excludes pride.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.200]   It does so in two ways.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.480]   One is that faith by nature looks away from ourselves to God.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   That's what faith is, a looking away from ourselves to God.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.840]   And the other way is that faith itself is a gift of God.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.560]   So here's the first, Romans 3:27.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.040]   Then what becomes of our boasting?
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.280]   It is excluded, Paul says.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.740]   By what kind of law?
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.360]   By a law of works?
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   No.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.560]   By the law of faith.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.740]   Faith excludes boasting.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.280]   You are not trusting God when you are boasting.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.740]   And you are not boasting when you are trusting God.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.440]   Faith is what a child does when it is happy to be helpless and safe in daddy's arms.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.640]   Let me say that again.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:18.800]   Faith is what a child has or does when it is happy to be helpless and safe in daddy's
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.960]   arms.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.200]   It does not boast.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   The child doesn't boast in its self-sufficiency.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.000]   "Oh, look how smart I am to be in daddy's arms."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It boasts in daddy.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600]   Look at his arms.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   Look at his smile.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.560]   And on top of that, faith is a gift.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.760]   For by grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.040]   This is not your own doing.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.480]   It is the gift of God, not of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.920]   There's a principle here that Paul expresses in 1 Corinthians 4:7.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.480]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   And if you received it, why do you boast as though it were not a gift?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:09.000]   So God appointed faith as the way of salvation to doubly exclude boasting.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.560]   Its nature is like a child to call attention to daddy's strength, not its own.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.240]   And even that is a gift of God.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.560]   Now why does God save us in this way, choosing to give faith to one person and not to another?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.840]   Because if it's a gift, some have it and some don't, and you see election.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.480]   God is choosing.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   He gives it to one.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.160]   He doesn't give it to all.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   Why?
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   Is it because he chooses us on the basis of some admirable quality so that we can boast
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.640]   in being chosen?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.480]   No, he doesn't.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   And Paul says—I mean, this is probably the clearest text in the Bible about the relationship
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.160]   between election and humility, or election and the destruction of pride.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   Listen to 1 Corinthians 1:26, "For consider your calling, brothers.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.600]   Not many of you were wise according to worldly standards.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.180]   Not many were powerful.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.320]   Not many were of noble birth.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:20.960]   But God chose"—here's the key word—"God chose what is foolish in the world to shame
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   the wise.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.720]   God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.920]   to nothing things that are."
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.520]   And here's the purpose for all those choosings.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.720]   "So that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   It is slain by election."
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.240]   Free, sovereign, God-willed, not man-determined election.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   God chose, God chose, God chose.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.600]   So that no human being might boast.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.360]   And then it continues like this, "And because of Him," because of God, "you are in Christ
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   Jesus."
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   You didn't do that.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.600]   You didn't jump into Christ.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.920]   You didn't raise yourself from the dead.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.200]   Because of God, you are in Christ Jesus, "who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.160]   sanctification, and redemption."
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.480]   One more time.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:29.960]   "So that, as it is written, 'Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.'"
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.440]   First Corinthians 1, 26-31.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:40.880]   So the entire method of saving us is designed for this.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.920]   Negatively, that no human being might boast in the presence of the Lord.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.960]   Simply, "Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord."
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.800]   So let this sink in.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.160]   Let us all pray that it would sink in.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:08.520]   We are saved in such a way that it makes God's sovereign grace shine as glorious and makes
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.900]   us look utterly helpless in ourselves, utterly dependent on God.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:22.320]   We were dead, blind, helpless, which means that we were no more worthy of salvation than
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.240]   anyone else.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:32.720]   Everybody, everybody that you would boast over, you're like them or worse than them,
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.600]   except for one thing, grace, grace, grace.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:45.940]   All self-exaltation is a recrucifixion of Christ, because he died to kill pride.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:54.820]   Every boast, therefore, mocks the suffering of Jesus, and—I end on this—and every
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:04.500]   humble attitude, every humble act of faith glorifies the grace of God in Christ.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   That's very helpful, Counselor.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   Pastor John, thank you.
