[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   Time is a limited resource that we all want more of.
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560]   So today, we're going to share the secret to make time in your life.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.800]   It's not going to be a bunch of productivity hacks to get more done,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.300]   finish your to-dos faster, or outsource your life.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.000]   Instead, we're going to share a framework and a bunch of tactics designed to help you
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560]   actually create more time in your day for the things you care about.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.080]   Whether that's spending time with your family, starting a side business,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.720]   learning a new language, writing a book, or anything else that's important to you.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   Big favor before we jump in is to give us a quick thumbs up to help others find this channel.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.680]   And if you're new here and want to keep upgrading your life, money, and travel, consider subscribing.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.200]   What do you think most people are getting wrong when it comes to how they manage their time?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.640]   Managing your time is not all about productivity.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.560]   In fact, we think that's sort of the wrong way to look at it entirely.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.080]   Instead, managing your time is about figuring out what matters the most to you
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.240]   in your work, in your life, and finding a way to bring your best efforts to bear
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   on those things that matter the most to you.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.640]   So to make that happen, we have to forget about a lot of the conventional wisdom about
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.240]   staying on top of things, being as responsive as possible,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840]   being the best employee possible in the traditional sense.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   And we've created a framework for rethinking the way you spend your energy every day
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.120]   and modifying all of these things that sometimes become invisible in the way that we behave,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.880]   the way we eat, exercise, respond to email, sleep, everything,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.520]   and restructuring it around spending your energy on what is most important.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.120]   So it's a four-part framework, and it all starts with a very simple idea that we call the highlight.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.640]   And the rest can be a mess.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.880]   But if you get the one most important thing,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000]   it's the biggest way to transform what you're doing at work
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.400]   and transform your experience in your life in general.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000]   - I think that seems obvious, right?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.200]   Oh, just get the one thing done.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.560]   It's not the first time I've heard that.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.720]   What did you guys uncover in all the research you've done
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.360]   that kind of makes it for a different perspective?
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120]   Or how did you approach it differently?
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.280]   - We had a really unique opportunity to do research,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.920]   to back up the things that we've seen firsthand.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.400]   Our weird research lab is that for the past, I don't know, what is it now?
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.760]   It's well over a decade.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.280]   John and I have had the opportunity to work with teams in these sprints.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   So we run design sprints, a process I created at Google.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.000]   John and I kind of perfected working with you at Google Ventures, Chris.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.200]   And we get the chance to take a team for a week at a time
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   and totally control the schedule as they're starting off their most important projects.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.160]   And in that sort of lab, we can see what happens
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   when you clear away all of the defaults of the way people normally work,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.200]   normally behave at work, normally have conversations,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.280]   normally manage their email and all that stuff.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.000]   You clear all of that away and do it in a different way, what happens?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   As we did that, these lessons came out that John and I started applying
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   to our own projects and then eventually our own lives, like our own day-to-day lives.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.280]   - I remember a lot of that process doing design sprints.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.960]   So I love that we broke it all down.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   But why do you think it matters?
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.480]   Why is this happening right now?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.720]   Why are people not able to be productive?
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.480]   Has this been tested, you know, lasted the entirety of human existence?
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.080]   - I definitely think it's lasted the entirety of the digital era of human existence.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.360]   And perhaps, you know, even a little bit longer than that.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.920]   The thing that's really new are these sources of effectively unlimited
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   information that we now pay attention to, right?
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.680]   So your email, which is, I guess, not technically infinite,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.760]   but effectively infinite, and Slack, and news, and social media, and all these things.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.640]   And we sort of fused that phenomenon with some ideas about industrial productivity.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.720]   And when we put those together, we created this situation where we feel like
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   the best way to be productive is to get really good at responding to those things,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.880]   to become really effective reaction machines,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.800]   instead of focusing on the things that we actually care about,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.200]   and the things that we actually need to spend time on, and want to spend time on.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   And so all of the world that we've constructed around ourselves,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.960]   the, you know, the defaults is a word that we use a lot.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.400]   And, you know, we use it partially because we, you know,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.280]   our background is in software product design.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.400]   And, you know, when you install a new piece of software, it has defaults.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.560]   But we think it's a really important word to understand,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.520]   just kind of like the way things work, the status quo,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.000]   sort of the normal mode of operation in the world.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   All these defaults, they don't encourage us to, you know,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   take Jake's advice and focus on one thing each day,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.480]   but they encourage us instead to react to the next thing and to say yes to every meeting,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.000]   and to pay attention to what's, you know, new on our screens.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   And so that has just made it really hard.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   And it continues to get worse because, you know,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   anybody listening to this or watching this knows that the tools that I just mentioned,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.960]   and the content that I just mentioned, it's only getting better and faster and more irresistible.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   So in some ways, these things are very old problems, very familiar human problems.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.160]   But in other ways, they continue to get harder to deal with.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.640]   - And Jake, we talk about productivity.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   And I think that's so often gets lost in the world of work, right?
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.440]   Like, I got to get more, you know, widgets made and, you know, email sent and projects built.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.920]   But when you guys wrote "Make Time", was it just about work?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   - No, it's not just about work.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.240]   And I think that the thing that really it's like, it's kind of hard to divide.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   I think a lot about the feeling at the end of the day, when you look back on the day,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   and you kind of, you know, have a feeling of how the day went,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.280]   and maybe think like, oh, what was the, you know, if you're talking to your,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.800]   you know, your significant other at dinner or your, you know,
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.360]   I keep this little journal where I write down like,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.800]   just things that I'm grateful for that happened during the day.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.000]   What are the things that happened in the day that make you feel good about the day?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.680]   That make you feel like, oh, this is a nice day.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   And usually it's a moment, right?
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.120]   It's like, it's a moment in the day.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   It's some kind of a highlight.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.600]   And that highlight might come from work,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   but they also often come from just day-to-day life.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.760]   The real trigger for me in kind of trying to take some of these ideas
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.280]   that we had been thinking about for work itself and applying them outside of work was,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.560]   I remember when my kids were little, playing on the floor with them with wooden trains.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.200]   And my son all of a sudden saying like, hey, dad, what's going on on your phone?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.760]   And he's just like genuinely wondering what interesting,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.520]   fascinating thing I'm looking at on my phone.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.440]   Because I'm, I didn't even realize it, but was looking at my phone while we were playing.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.560]   After all of my efforts to be as, you know,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.440]   on top of my work as possible and as efficient as possible.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.800]   Like, it was like, you know, in, in, uh, in the Lord of the Rings,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.400]   when like Bilbo Baggins reaches in his, in his pocket to pull out the ring,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.760]   like you don't even know you're doing it.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.840]   The thing I realized at that moment was that this, this pull of react,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.320]   like the reaction machine thing that John talked about.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.120]   It's, it's ever present in our lives.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.360]   And if you take this lens of, I'm going to focus on the one most important thing,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   and I'm going to try to eliminate those defaults, all those polls,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   wherever I possibly can, wherever they don't serve me,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.960]   wherever I'm serving them rather than them serving me,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.680]   then the game changes in your, in your larger life too.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.080]   And in that moment, I like deleted every app on my phone that had infinite content in it.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.600]   You know, and this is like 2012.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.880]   So I was like, deleted like my, my email off the phone.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.680]   I deleted all of the, you know, the games I deleted Facebook and Instagram.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.160]   And I deleted, you know, the, uh, I figured I would turn off the browser.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.080]   I was so angry at myself, you know, I was just like,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.240]   so frustrated that I would give up this time that I knew was precious with my kids
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.840]   for unknown, the unknown poll of, of the infinite.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.600]   And, uh, and I haven't got, I haven't gone back actually.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.520]   And so that like, just as kind of like feeling that the default settings
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.480]   that the world is asking of us are crazy.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   And they're pulling us away from the people we love the most.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.960]   And at work, they pull us away from the projects where we can actually do the most good,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.040]   where we can have the largest effect,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.920]   because nobody has a better insight into what you can do.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.040]   That's going to be of outsized importance and probably in you yourself,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.280]   everywhere, these forces are kind of working against us.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.000]   So everywhere we can benefit from fighting back.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.680]   Before we just tell everyone to delete everything on their phone, which we might do.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.160]   You talked about this infinite stuff, which kind of dovetails to these two important things,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.240]   busy bandwagon, infinity pools.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.640]   Let's talk about what those are and how they're probably taking away our time.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.680]   So the busy bandwagon is where these defaults show up in culture.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.360]   So the expectation that you say yes to every meeting,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.720]   the expectation that you should constantly monitor your email and respond right away.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.280]   The expectation that you should be busy,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:34.400]   that being busy is a sign that you are an important and successful person in the world.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.240]   So that's kind of the culture.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.480]   And I think we all find ourselves either on the bandwagon or
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.520]   wishing we were on the bandwagon at some point in our lives.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:51.600]   The infinity pools, that's kind of our term for the places where defaults show up in our
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.760]   technology and in our media and content.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.640]   And we came up with this term because when you think about email, you think about social media,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.440]   even streaming, there's an infinite source of content.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   There's always water in the pool.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.320]   You can always jump back in at any time.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.680]   Those are infinity pools.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.520]   And the bad news is that those are really irresistible.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:24.240]   They're very effectively designed and engineered and optimized to be irresistible.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.880]   But the good news is that they're actually pretty easy to put up barriers around.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.120]   It's pretty easy to change the defaults so that it's maybe not totally impossible to access.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   Because I use all those things that I just mentioned.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.720]   I help design some of them.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.920]   I find a lot of value in them.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.160]   But it's relatively straightforward.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:54.240]   If you know a few tricks, if you know a few, we call them tactics, specific ways of creating
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   barriers, of changing the defaults, basically to make it just harder to get sucked in, to
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   make these things slightly less irresistible, to add some friction that then kind of frees
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.040]   you up and frees up your energy so that you don't have to be fighting these things and
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   trying to stay super focused and productive.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.000]   But instead, you're freed up to really effortlessly spend time on the things that matter.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.360]   We're going to go through your framework.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.120]   We're going to talk about these tactics.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.920]   But what's the end result of how the day feels, the week feels, life feels?
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.480]   I want to share one quick thing that you will feel right away, which is bored.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.800]   And I know that sounds odd.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.080]   That doesn't sound very appealing.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.880]   But it's actually kind of refreshing to feel that.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:50.320]   I remember when I first adopted the distraction-free phone, which is what we call this idea of
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   a smartphone that has all of the infinity pools removed from it.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.720]   I remember just having these moments where I was like, "Oh, wow.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.200]   There's nothing I have to check right now.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.800]   I'm on a walk or I'm waiting in line."
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.400]   Or even better, I just sat down to do some work, and I don't have that sense that I have
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.200]   to check something.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.280]   That pull is gone.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.560]   And at first, it's sort of alarming.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.920]   You're like, "Whoa, that's weird."
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.280]   And then you're like, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.080]   I can just pay attention to the things that I actually care about."
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.560]   So that's sort of the immediate feeling.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.960]   But Jake, maybe you could talk about how it feels over time.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.240]   Because you're far more diligent about this than I am.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.040]   And you've had a truly distraction-free phone for like 12 years now or something, right?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I backslide occasionally.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.760]   I'll have something on there, take a trip and put email on there.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.480]   And then I'll take it off because it's true that once you get used to this feeling of
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:55.760]   not having the pull, it's like there's been a rope around your neck that's gone.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.240]   It's a feeling of freedom.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   And it does manifest first.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.680]   I think first it's stressful.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.600]   It's stressful to think like, "What am I missing?"
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:11.360]   And I guess I'm old enough to remember what it was like before we had smartphones.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:18.080]   And so I do have this pretty solid bedrock knowledge that you can survive.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.680]   You can be an effective person without having access to your email or Slack or the internet
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.240]   or whatever at any moment of the day.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   That feeling at first is stressful.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.040]   And then maybe the next feeling is boredom.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.360]   Another manifestation of boredom is that time slows down
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.080]   and that you feel like you actually get more lifetime
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.040]   because your time is going a little bit slower.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.200]   When I'm in the mode, when I have everything on my phone
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.720]   and sometimes I have to turn it on for a trip, right?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.480]   Like I said, for whatever reason, or I try out some app and then I realize,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.160]   "Oh my God, this is an infinity pool."
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.440]   And at those times, I feel like I'm just constantly on.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.120]   My brain has no rest.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.800]   And time just starts to blur by.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.560]   It starts to go by faster.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   And our experience of time, it's not fixed.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.600]   Sometimes it goes really, really fast and sometimes it slows down.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.760]   And I found that it slows down in a really good way
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.800]   when the defaults are, when we create barriers.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.240]   Just so anyone listening who hasn't read the book yet knows,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.840]   this isn't a book of distraction-free phone.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.720]   There are a lot of tactics.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.920]   So if someone's listening and thinks,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.640]   "Wow, that one is not where I want to start."
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.280]   We're going to get through a lot of options.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.600]   You don't have to get rid of every app on your phone.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.760]   It's just one of the tactics.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.320]   So maybe the best thing to do now is just start
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.720]   and kind of walk people through what are the kind of high-level framework,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   how people can start to make time.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.800]   Make time is this framework that Jake and I created.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   And it's comprised of four different categories or four steps.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.480]   The first is highlight, which we talked about.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   It's this idea that you should identify the single most important thing
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.560]   that you want to spend time on each day and then focus on it.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.040]   The second step is laser.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.840]   And this is really about setting up these barriers to distraction,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.000]   changing the defaults around the technology that you use
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.240]   so that you can maintain laser-like focus on your highlight
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.760]   on that one thing you've identified.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.960]   The third part is energize.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.920]   And this is sort of a recognition that the first two steps
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.560]   aren't really going to work if we don't take care of ourselves,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.600]   our brains and our bodies, our mental health and our physical health.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.760]   And so, the advice in energize is all about simple ways
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   to reset some of the more physical defaults in our world
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.200]   so that we can have more energy, so that we can pay better attention,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.720]   we can make really good use of that time in those moments.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.840]   And then the fourth, the final part of make time, the final step is to reflect.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.600]   And we take an experimental approach to this stuff.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.880]   And really, in a lot of things, I mean, we both have worked
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.680]   in the technology industry for a long time, and we work with a lot of startups.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.480]   And we're always encouraging those teams to run experiments,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.680]   to sort of create tiny loops of feedback from their product
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.440]   to their customers and back.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.000]   And we think that's really important in our own lives, our own days.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.880]   And so, the final step of make time is really to pay attention
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.200]   to what's working and what's not working and say,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.600]   "Oh, I tried removing everything from my phone, but it was too much.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.280]   Or I actually felt that I wasn't able to get this important thing done,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.600]   or I ended up just reinstalling everything.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.360]   That didn't work, so maybe I'm going to try something else.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.720]   Maybe I'm going to pick a different tactic out of the book."
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.680]   But I think even if you're not trying a ton of different stuff,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.880]   simply paying attention, treating your time and your life as an experiment,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.160]   a series of experiments, just like you might do at work, is really important.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.720]   And it's the thing that kind of completes the loop
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.760]   and just makes it all click together much more effectively.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.520]   This framework comes from when we were running these design sprints,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.480]   and we still are, so we've run hundreds of these now with companies.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.400]   And we sort of saw that this notion of having a highlight
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.280]   that we focused on each day, one most important thing
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.760]   that we brought our peak energy to, that we were sure
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.880]   there was time and attention for, that having laser focus during that time,
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.120]   clearing away all distractions was super important,
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.920]   and that the energy of the team was important that we needed to carefully monitor.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.280]   When are people having snacks?
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   You know, when are we taking a stretch break?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.640]   What are the kind of max hours we can work
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   where we're still in the optimal mode?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.840]   And reflecting and looking back and finding ways to improve it.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.480]   When we started applying these ourselves to our own lives,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.960]   when John and I started saying, "Hey, the stuff that we've learned here
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.440]   with these hundreds of startups, let's apply it for ourselves,"
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.760]   we found that there are some things that work for me that don't work for John,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.760]   some things that work for John that don't work for me.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.400]   So we don't think of it as this one-size-fits-all recipe.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.240]   It's just the framework is kind of undeniably true, we think.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.920]   And the way you apply that framework, it's going to depend.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.680]   It's going to depend on what floats your boat.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.920]   But no matter who you are, it sounds like
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.240]   everybody should start the day with a highlight.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.440]   That has certainly turned out to be the thing from this book
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.640]   that people have unanimously said, "Wow, that is transformative."
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.680]   And, you know, like, of course, we love to have people
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.120]   buy the book, read the book, or listen to the book on Audible or whatever.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.080]   But if you just start making a practice of every day in the evening
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.600]   or in the morning, identifying a highlight for the next day,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.520]   and we can talk more about how to do that,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   how we think about doing that so it works best.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.040]   And then reflecting back at the end of the day and saying, like,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   "Was I able to make time for my highlight?"
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.600]   Incredibly powerful shift in the way you get things done at work,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.240]   pay attention to what you care about in your life,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.640]   unlock projects that you thought you couldn't get to,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.840]   and slow down your life in a really, we think, transformative way.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.240]   And having one highlight doesn't mean you only do one thing a day, right?
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.440]   So the one highlight is the single thing that you want to bring
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.080]   your best energy to, your best focus to.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.120]   And we tend to find that there's a couple different categories
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.880]   that those highlights fit into.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.800]   So sometimes it's urgency.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.840]   Sometimes it's a project that, you know, really needs to get done.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.240]   It's important, and you want to give it its proper, you know,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.960]   do its proper respect and make it happen.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.240]   Sometimes it's satisfaction.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.120]   It's a project, like Jake mentioned, where, you know,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.360]   maybe it's not going to happen otherwise.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.200]   And, you know, it's going to feel really good
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.680]   to have finally spent time on that thing.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.600]   And sometimes it's just based in joy, right?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.840]   Sometimes it's just something that is going to be fun for you.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.320]   It's going to be, you know, kind of restorative.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.760]   It's going to, you know, help you spend time with yourself,
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.960]   with your family, with your friends.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.000]   But, you know, we kind of think of it as this, like,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.960]   60 to 90 minute sort of block in the day.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.080]   And then the rest of your day is, you know, everything else, right?
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.840]   And so, you know, when I look at my days,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   most days I have a focus block in the morning.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.160]   And then my meetings are after lunch.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.640]   And then I have an admin block at the end of the day
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.680]   to get through, you know, email and things like that.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.960]   And, you know, it might not sound that, I don't know,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.400]   earth shattering to say,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.200]   "Oh, I'm going to spend 60 to 90 minutes on something."
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.320]   But it's an amount of time that if you truly use it
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.600]   to focus on one thing, actually is pretty huge.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.080]   You know, it's a level of focus that I think most people
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.920]   don't have in their day-to-day lives.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.160]   And once you get in the habit of doing that,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.240]   a lot of the other things start to fall into place.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.960]   A lot, you get this clarity about what really matters
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.880]   and what can take the back seat.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.280]   And so it's not about, you know, doing only that one thing,
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.480]   but really making sure that you identify
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.440]   and then make time for that one most important thing
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.940]   each day.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.280]   I have two questions.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.000]   So one, yesterday, I had these two things
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.880]   that were going to happen.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.280]   So one, I needed to finish this part of the website
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.000]   I was building.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.920]   And I was like that, in my mind,
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.680]   that was like the urgency highlight.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   But then my wife and I, we both took one of our kids.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.920]   And instead of going out to dinner as a family,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   I took our youngest daughter out on a date.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.400]   My wife took our oldest daughter out on a date.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.320]   And then we didn't plan on this,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.720]   but we ended up meeting for dessert after.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.800]   Like, were both of those the highlight?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.760]   Can I have two?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.320]   How do I think about like two very different
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.440]   and competing things?
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.200]   The way that I think about it is,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.720]   is the highlight is the thing
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.200]   that wouldn't otherwise get your time
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.600]   or wouldn't otherwise get your energy.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.000]   And that varies day to day and week to week and month.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.840]   Like, you know, even as you go through different,
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.240]   you know, eras in your life, different seasons,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.480]   you might find that you need to, you know,
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.080]   your highlight needs to be something different.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.760]   And so, you know, it's, I can't answer your question
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.200]   without like being inside your head,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.160]   but like, it sounds like the, you know,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.640]   the urgent thing during the day was like the thing that,
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.480]   you know, it could have easily gotten away from you.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.520]   It could have easily been like,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.720]   oh, I'm doing all this other stuff
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.080]   and I can never get to that one thing.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.640]   But, you know, on the other hand,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.120]   maybe you've been meaning to, you know,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.280]   kind of take your kids out and, you know,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.160]   to dinner and these, you know, in this way for a while,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.760]   but you had never quite got around to it.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.440]   And so then maybe that's what you needed.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.160]   But, you know, I think it's part of the,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.920]   what's helpful about this daily cycle
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.080]   of reflecting and paying attention is
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.440]   you can ask yourself, like, what do I need now?
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.560]   Like, what do I need my highlight to be?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.240]   And what's going to take care of itself?
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.280]   What's going to happen anyway,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.320]   either because it's scheduled
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.640]   or because I have a routine for it or a habit for it.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.400]   And that's a little bit outside of this idea
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.200]   of the really intentional focus with the highlight.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.880]   - And it can change throughout the day, right?
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.040]   - Yeah, it can, it absolutely can.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   Well, I have a different one from yesterday.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.080]   So the, so yesterday, for example,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.240]   I just finished the manuscript for our book
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.920]   and I'm really excited to send it
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.360]   to some of our test readers.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.160]   And I was, that was gonna be my highlight.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.520]   It's like, I cannot wait to do that.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.440]   And then as it happened,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520]   because I've been in like a bit of crunch mode
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.280]   getting this thing done, I was like, wait a second,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.800]   I can hang out with my younger son
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.320]   and do some projects with him around the farm here.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.160]   And that ended up being what I did during that time slot
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.800]   when I pictured I was going to send out the manuscript
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.200]   because the reality was, I realized in the moment,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.880]   I was like, will it really kill me
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.000]   if I send those out tomorrow instead of today?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.800]   I was like, no, it won't.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.560]   But this is a really special opportunity.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.760]   I'm gonna switch my highlight.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.080]   This is where I wanna put that peak energy.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.760]   This is the one thing I wanna make sure
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.520]   I give my strongest attention to.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.600]   And it was worth it.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.800]   It was absolutely worth it.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.720]   It was a special opportunity, right?
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.480]   And the thing that looking back on the day,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.920]   I was like, I can remember that.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.080]   So the notion that your highlight has to be set in stone
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.280]   when you, once you pick it,
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.360]   sometimes you're gonna change your mind during the day.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.440]   Sometimes an opportunity is gonna come up
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.800]   and that's gonna be the right thing to do
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.920]   or you're gonna realize it.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.640]   But as John says, it's just this practice of day in
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.840]   and day out thinking about what's most important.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.600]   Where do I wanna make sure if nothing else happens,
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.760]   I bring my peak energy to it.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.440]   I bring my best focus to it.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.560]   The thing that I'm gonna enjoy.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.200]   And that's for us really the power of the highlight.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.240]   - One other nice thing about the highlight
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.200]   is that even when you switch your highlight,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.600]   when, like Jake said, you were planning to do this thing,
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.800]   but you ended up doing something else.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.800]   If you've created this habit of choosing a highlight
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   and making time for it each day,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.760]   it's like you have some slack in your schedule.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.800]   If you were booked back to back from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   and a cool opportunity came up to hang out
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   with your son or a friend or whatever,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.000]   there's no slack.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.600]   There's no room for that thing to happen.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.800]   You have to go and cancel stuff
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.760]   but it's a bunch of extra work to email people
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.120]   and rearrange it or whatever.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.200]   But when you've built your day around one block,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.280]   it becomes a little easier to move things
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.480]   in or out of that block
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.320]   depending on what you need in that particular day.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.960]   - Now, we talked earlier, the book's filled with tactics.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.560]   So maybe let's pick a few.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.800]   Let's highlight a few highlight tactics
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   and flag some of the things people might want to do
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.600]   to really make this work well.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.400]   - I'll start with a tactic that's actually
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.120]   not in the book.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   It's based on a tactic in the book.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.240]   So I'll tell you the one it's based on
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.360]   and I'll tell you what I actually do.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.720]   So there's a tactic in the book called design your day
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.200]   and it is sort of what it sounds like.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.800]   The idea is to use your calendar
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.320]   not as kind of this list of things you have to do
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.280]   or this list of things that somebody else dictated for you
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.720]   but think of it as a canvas.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.880]   Think of it as your planner for the day
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   where you can sort of draw out,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.760]   you can design out your day,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   how you want to spend time, what's important to you.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.800]   I realized a couple of years ago
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.640]   that most days I kind of want the same things,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.760]   I need the same things
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.520]   and that I could create a calendar template.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.640]   So this is a really important tactic for me
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.840]   is that I have basically,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.360]   I have a template for my time for the week
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.880]   and there's certain parts of the week
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.240]   that are for focus work,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.920]   certain parts of the week that are for meetings,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.480]   parts of the week that are for admin work,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.520]   sort of shallow work.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.600]   And that basically repeats every week
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.680]   and it's just this like scaffolding
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.200]   that I can kind of build on.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.720]   And then the extra cool thing
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.120]   is that there's this company called Reclaim
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.240]   that we invested in at Character,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.680]   which is our VC firm.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.920]   But initially, I was just a user of the product
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   that sort of manages that template for you.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.200]   So you kind of define,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.960]   you know, these are the habits that I have,
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.320]   these are the things that I need to do
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.000]   and approximately when I want to do them
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.160]   and how much time they're going to take.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   And then your calendar sort of gets adjusted
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.680]   around those things.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.920]   Reclaim sort of adjusts your calendar around,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.120]   "Oh, if a meeting pops up here,
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.880]   we'll move lunch forward by 30 minutes
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.920]   to make room for that."
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.640]   Things like that.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.000]   And so that's been probably one of my
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.560]   most important and durable tactics
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   is this idea of a calendar template
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.680]   to make sure that sort of week in and week out,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.080]   I'm sort of big picture,
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.640]   you know, spending time on the things that matter
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.200]   rather than kind of getting sucked back into,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.640]   you know, the busy bandwagon
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.520]   of just filling more and more of each subsequent day
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.760]   with meetings and email and things like that.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.080]   - On the opposite end of the spectrum,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.120]   because that's a very powerful tool
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.880]   and a very like a powerful way
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.040]   to take control of your time over,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.640]   you know, not just a day,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.520]   but you can extend it to weeks and months
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   and it can become the template for how you work.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.880]   And I've learned from John
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.720]   and apply that to my own calendar.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.400]   But on the opposite end of the spectrum,
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.960]   a sticky note is an incredible tool
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.080]   for setting your highlight.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.000]   So you start out the day,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.600]   say, "Okay, what's the thing
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.280]   that's gonna be the most urgent
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.040]   or the most important,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.560]   bring the most satisfaction or joy?"
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.600]   Whatever it might be to me.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.000]   You take your best guess at what that's gonna be.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.680]   You write it down on a sticky note
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.720]   and you stick it on a visible place on your phone.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.960]   You stick it on your computer display.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.200]   You stick it on your laptop or whatever,
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.240]   wherever you're gonna be.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.840]   You stick it somewhere where you can see it,
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.800]   stick it in the kitchen,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.240]   stick it on the dashboard of your car.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.160]   And then you just see that thing
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.520]   and you're like, "Right, that's right.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.040]   That's the thing I wanna make sure
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.640]   I bring my peak energy to."
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.680]   And then at the end of the day,
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.240]   you look back and you see if you did it.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.680]   I think that that practice
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.880]   simply of identifying it
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.040]   and writing it down somewhere that I can see it
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.160]   is really powerful for me
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.720]   because I don't think I'm alone in this.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.000]   I think I can do more in a day than I can.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.760]   I always think I'm gonna do this and this and this
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.840]   and there's like 10 things I'm gonna do today.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.600]   And I vastly overestimate what I'll be able to get done.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.440]   And as a result, I'm constantly,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.080]   if I don't have rails to protect myself,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.600]   I'm constantly kicking myself for what I did not do.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.000]   I'm constantly feeling like I did not measure up
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.440]   to the standards that I set
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.200]   because the to-do list was so long.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.320]   The inbox was so long
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.680]   and I thought I'd be able to get through
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.960]   all of these things.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.640]   The highlight is a really powerful way
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.800]   to steer me back and just writing it down.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.040]   It's like, okay, look, realistically, pal,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.480]   your previous self from like 10,000 previous days
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.720]   says you probably only gonna get one thing done
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   if you're lucky that's on your list
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.080]   and really do it well.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.120]   So you do that.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.400]   Maybe you get lucky today,
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.760]   you get three or four things done,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.440]   but just seeing that one thing,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.720]   it's a powerful thing to help me reset my own expectations.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.320]   - I'll add a couple more highlight tactics
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.520]   that I think are helpful and that I use a lot.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.760]   One is called batch the little stuff.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.680]   And I bring it up partially 'cause it's really important,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.480]   but partially because I know that we're at the point
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.520]   in the conversation where most people listening are like,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.680]   yeah, yeah, that sounds nice.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.280]   But like, I got a lot of stuff to do.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.720]   Like, when do I do all this stuff?
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.440]   You know, my day is made up of like 15 little things
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.240]   I have to do, not like one big thing that I need to do.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   And so whenever possible,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.800]   I try to batch the little stuff together.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.320]   So rather than like an email here,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.600]   oh, jump back to that blog post I'm trying to write.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.880]   Oh, another email came in.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.160]   Okay, back to the blog post.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.960]   You know, multitasking doesn't really work.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.040]   We're not really capable of multitasking.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.640]   Instead of doing that, I will save all those little things,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.520]   all those emails for a chunk of time.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.880]   And I mentioned earlier this idea of an admin block.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.040]   And the cool thing about it is that not only are you
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.440]   sort of not feeling like you're pulled back and forth
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.040]   between things you're able to focus,
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   but you actually get better at doing that thing, right?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.360]   Like if you spend an hour going through your email,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.480]   you're better at email.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   You're more efficient at email
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.240]   than if you tried to do one email every five minutes
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.440]   throughout the entire day.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.000]   So that's, I think, an important one
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.920]   and just a practical one that I would encourage people
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.880]   to keep in mind, batch the little stuff.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.200]   - How do you keep track of that little stuff?
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.600]   - Well, a lot of it has its own inbox.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.720]   It lives in a place.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.480]   And so I, you know, I think a lot of productivity experts
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.920]   so-called would say, don't use your inbox as a to-do list.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.080]   But I do.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.000]   I basically, my inbox is my to-do list
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.200]   for all the little stuff.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.240]   So it's like, if there's a notification from, you know,
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.120]   something in Notion, you know, we use Notion internally
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.240]   at character for kind of our OS for the team.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.960]   If there's a notification, it'll be in my inbox.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.320]   There's something I need to follow up on.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.360]   It's in my inbox.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.640]   I send myself a lot of email.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   I have an app that is, it's called Compose.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   And all it does is it opens the Compose sheet on iOS
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.760]   so I can send myself an email without looking at my inbox.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.120]   And so then at the end of the day,
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.000]   when I get to that admin block, I open my inbox
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.480]   and I just kind of work through those things.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.240]   Anything that isn't a little thing,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.440]   that's a big thing, then it has to go on my calendar.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.280]   A big thing, you know, needs to have some time dedicated to it
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   or I need to decide that I'm not doing it right now,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.040]   that it's going to get deferred until later.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.360]   And the last thing before we move on is,
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.560]   what about days where you just don't get the highlight done?
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.080]   Can you do it the next day?
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.520]   Absolutely.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.760]   Yeah, you can just try again the next day.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.800]   I mean, certainly that happens to me all the time.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.120]   And the part of the Notion with this too,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.240]   is that you see each day as an experiment.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Now, these are the combination of tactics I tried today.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   And if it didn't work today, maybe I picked the wrong highlight
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.120]   that wasn't accurately what was most important.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.280]   Or maybe the system just broke down.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.000]   But again, I think maybe this is like oversharing or it's about me.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.720]   But personally, I'll default to kind of kicking myself
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   if I don't do things right.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.080]   But this notion of like, it's one day at a time,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.560]   let's look and reflect on what happened today
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.600]   and then figure out like, OK, there was probably some thing
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.920]   that was working against me.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.120]   There's all these powerful forces, these social pressures,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.960]   and all this software that's working against me all the time.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   What's a way I can battle it differently tomorrow?
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.400]   And maybe I'll try this highlight again.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.880]   Or maybe like that highlight was just bigger than I thought it was
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.000]   and there's more to it.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.440]   And so I'm going to do it again.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.520]   Or maybe I'm going to do it again because I did it
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.320]   and it was great.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.240]   And like, I can go back to that.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.640]   Well, like any of those things are fine.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.520]   And this all plays into feedback loops, right?
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.280]   Like you could process what you did.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.200]   How quick are those feedback loops?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.240]   Are you trying to get that feedback daily, weekly, monthly?
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.080]   Do you visit them in different ways?
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.240]   Or do we punt on that and come back to it?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.080]   We think daily is the right level of focus.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.520]   We think that looking at this day by day is zoomed in enough
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.600]   that you can do something about it.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.560]   Like Jake said, if you didn't get to your highlight
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.280]   or you didn't complete it and you want to try it again tomorrow
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.800]   or you want to try something different tomorrow,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.120]   you can do something about it.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.840]   It's actionable.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.600]   But it's also zoomed out enough that you are, I don't know,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   able to think a little bit more holistically,
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.720]   sort of bigger picture about how you're spending your days,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.200]   which is how you're spending your life.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.240]   So we recommend that people,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.480]   when they're just getting started with this reflection stuff,
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.360]   that they do it daily.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.640]   We think that's kind of the sweet spot.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.320]   So we've got our highlight.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.840]   We know what we want to focus on.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   We picked it the night before the morning of.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.000]   I'm really excited to talk about how we get laser focus
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.680]   because I've seen it myself, right?
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.000]   I know that when I hit that moment,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.480]   I can get done things in an hour that otherwise I'm like,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.400]   wow, I've been I've tried to work on this 10 times over multiple days.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.000]   And then I just found that spot.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.360]   What are some of the best ways to find that focus?
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.320]   One way that we think about this is there's
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.840]   the first half of finding that focus is identifying what you want to focus on.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.920]   And then if you're trying to point a laser at that target,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.440]   the next question is, how do you get the disco ball of distraction
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.920]   out of the way so that the laser can hit the target?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.640]   John and I and you will, you too, Chris, you built products for years and years.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.960]   And you know that we all know that the there's a lot of effort
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.600]   always being put into making things simpler for us, taking steps away from things.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:23.840]   Right.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.920]   So whether that's, you know, one click by on Amazon or AI results on search,
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.640]   instead of having to dig through web pages, whatever it is,
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.480]   people are always trying to take a step away so you can get to the thing faster.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.520]   That's a big business.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.840]   There's a lot of there's a lot of economic incentive
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.960]   for people to take steps away and make it easier for us to do other things.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.040]   Doing projects that we care about, there usually are extra steps.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.920]   We usually have to spend some extra time to get there.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.160]   So one of the first things we do is to try to build steps to get to the distractions,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.360]   try to add some steps back in so that the disco ball is pushed out to the side.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:08.400]   And similarly to how we might, you know, I take apps off of my phone
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.760]   that I think are going to distract me.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.080]   You can do the same thing on your computer.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.560]   So you can use there's an app called Freedom that'll either block a specific
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.120]   list of websites or block the Internet altogether for a period of time.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.600]   So you can say, I want freedom for, you know, 30 minutes, 45 minutes,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.000]   60 minutes, 90 minutes, the whole day, whatever.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.480]   And it'll shut down access to those things.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   You can go so far as to put like a vacation timer on your router
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   so that you just turn off the Wi-Fi.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.200]   Then there are also things you can do to reset the expectations
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:49.280]   other people have of how fast you're going to respond to messages, email and the like.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.600]   The reset expectations one.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.880]   I think my I don't want to say favorite because there are a lot of good things, but
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.320]   the idea of setting up an autoresponder that's like,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.800]   I've broken up my day or this is how I focus.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.080]   I might not get back to you.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.920]   If it's urgent, you can text me.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.400]   You probably have a better template for that.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.640]   But that just was really interesting because I think the fear we all have is,
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.920]   "Well, if I don't check my email, but once a day, what if there's something important?"
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.760]   And the answer, one way is to say, "Get over it. Nothing's that important."
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.720]   The other way is to create another avenue
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.280]   and set up a barrier if it really is that important.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.080]   We have a friend that we work with, a business partner named Connor Swenson,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.240]   who has taken make time and he teaches it to teams.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.720]   You know, he works with big companies and sort of
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.840]   helps them figure out how to implement this stuff inside their companies.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.320]   And one of the things that he does with those teams is
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.880]   he walks them through what their minimum viable frequency is of checking email.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.520]   And it's an interesting exercise and you can do it for yourself.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.560]   You can kind of think about, "In my work, in my life, how long could I go
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.320]   without checking email, without anything really bad happening?"
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.560]   And you can define bad however you want.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.000]   Like if you're in a customer-facing role, you're in sales or something like that,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.800]   maybe it's a little bit shorter than it is if you are
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.200]   a writer or a product designer or something like that.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.480]   But when you ask people that question,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.960]   the answer is almost always more than an hour, right?
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.240]   Like it's really hard to find somebody who would say,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.280]   "Oh, if I don't check my email every hour, I'm screwed.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.880]   Like I'm going to get fired from my job.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.560]   Like it's going to be horrible."
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.080]   Yet even that alone is like, you know, sort of an easy change that you can make
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.760]   is to just like reduce the frequency of when you check your email.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.320]   And this idea then of having sort of this cascade of like,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.680]   "Well, I can't respond right now, but if you really need me to respond
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.160]   in the next four minutes, like contact me this other way."
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   That just adds a little bit of extra friction.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.000]   It enables you to push that frequency of when you check something,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.840]   maybe even longer, maybe to four hours, maybe to a whole day, something like that.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.160]   Yeah. Jake, you've gone the distraction-free phone route for a while.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.320]   You've removed the apps, you've gotten rid of everything.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.000]   There is an alternative for people who aren't ready for that, which is,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.360]   well, you could keep the apps on your phone, but log out of them.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.600]   So it's harder to get in or take them off your home screen or turn off the notifications.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.040]   So, or I am guessing what you do is you just use them on your computer,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.240]   or maybe you have another iPad that you use them on, but you're kind of,
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.640]   you're not saying don't do all these things.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.240]   You're saying make it harder or make yourself have to do them somewhere else.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.920]   Yeah, it's really nice if you can confine them to a spot.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:39.760]   And, you know, I think that sometimes you may find,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.640]   and I have found that when I create separation from those things,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   when I stop getting this sort of constant, like constant feedback loop with,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.360]   I mean, this happened for me with social media, like with Facebook, with Instagram, whatever.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.960]   Like when I stopped having the constant feedback loop with it,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.440]   it started to feel a lot less necessary.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.840]   And I realized it was more pleasant for me when I was in those times when I was away from it
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.400]   than when I was at my computer and could access it.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.720]   And so I just gave up altogether.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.440]   But for other things, it really is just about creating that, creating that bit of space.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.960]   And that space can be device related.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.040]   It could be geographic.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.280]   Like, you know, I can do this stuff in my office
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.680]   because that's where my sort of desktop computer sits or whatever.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.840]   It can also be a temporal space.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.880]   Like this is the time block when I use this stuff.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.000]   And this is the time when I don't.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.840]   And again, that freedom app can be really helpful.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.120]   You can have scheduled blocks.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.880]   You can say, I always want these things or everything to turn off at this time
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.720]   and turn back on again at this time.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:52.000]   And that's, you know, that it's not about necessarily giving everything up.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.200]   And I don't think that's, I don't think it's realistic for most of us.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.640]   And for all of us, there's probably things that we don't want to give up.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.080]   But it's really just about changing the, changing the relationship
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.520]   and not feeling like we aren't going to get our money's worth out of our phone
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:13.840]   or we're going to miss out if we're not on top of things 100% of the time.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.480]   When we wrote Make Time, I don't recall two-factor authentication being like
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.520]   a big deal and maybe it was, but I don't remember it.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   But now it is like virtual.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.320]   I mean, you can set up two-factor off on Twitter, on LinkedIn,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.400]   you know, on things that are not sort of like mission critical applications.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.160]   And that's actually another great way to add friction.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.680]   That's something I started doing in the last couple of years is turning on
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.400]   two-factor even for stuff that I don't care about.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.000]   So in addition to logging out or enabling something like freedom,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.240]   that's another really simple tactic that you can use.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.360]   That's not in the book, but I use a ton and really helps.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   And all these things are reversible.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.120]   Now, one tactic that I use, and I can't tell if it's a stalling tactic or a good tactic,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.440]   but I find personally that that sensation of like, "Ah, things aren't in order.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.880]   I haven't checked my inbox.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.160]   My desk is a mess."
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.320]   When I can get rid of those things, I feel more capable of just diving in.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.400]   Now, on the flip side, there's some advice, even a tactic in the book that's like,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.920]   "Don't check all your email in the morning.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.000]   Use the morning for productive time."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.800]   Which I think for me, would have me the entire time I'm trying to be productive being like,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.000]   "I still don't know if these things need to be resolved."
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   Whereas if I wake up, and sometime in the morning, I go through,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.960]   make sure there's nothing urgent.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.000]   I clean off my desk, and I'm like, "Now I'm going to focus."
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.560]   Am I kidding myself?
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.720]   Or is it different for everyone?
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.360]   I think one thing that we have learned is that it is different for everyone.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.080]   So I never want to say like, "Chris, you're wrong.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.200]   You're deluding yourself."
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.160]   I mean, you probably are.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.680]   But the reality of it is that there's this discomfort that I think we kind of have to
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:58.000]   get used to because the prevailing culture and the prevailing expectation is that we're
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.360]   going to be on top of things.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   And so not being on top of things.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.800]   And by on top of things, I mean, I've gone through my email, I've responded to everything
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.160]   that I feel like I either have to, or sort of socially obligated to in some way.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.080]   I've checked my, you know, I've checked Slack, I've checked everything.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.120]   I'm sort of up to speed.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.240]   I've checked the news.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.920]   Like there is a feeling of I've checked everything and done all that work.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   And now the decks are clear.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.400]   And now I can truly focus.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.240]   And I won't lie to you.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.360]   There is a feeling of psychological freedom that happens when you feel like everything
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.240]   is taken care of.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:40.720]   The cost, however, of achieving that level of psychological freedom for most of us is
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.160]   the cost of investing more deeply in these bigger things that are harder to make time
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.880]   for.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.440]   And that cost comes both from the time that you spend catching up and clearing the decks
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.600]   and also from the attention residue.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.000]   I've been working in my email.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.520]   I've been reading the news or whatever.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.720]   And now I feel like I'm caught up.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.800]   But that stuff is still with me.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.360]   It's still in my head in some way.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:10.720]   And this idea of attention residue, it comes from the study by Dr. Sophie Leroy from the
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.840]   University of Washington.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   I think we first heard about it from Cal Newport.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.520]   And it's a fascinating idea.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:20.480]   These things just stick with us and make it harder for us to be fully all in on another
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.200]   topic.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.720]   I think it helps to start off with an activity we call Stack Rank Your Life.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:31.680]   So you just like make a list of every single project, work project, life project that you
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.680]   currently have going on and also the ones that you'd like to do but do not have time
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:35.920]   for.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.800]   And then in whatever order, write that list out and then put them in order.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.880]   Like what's the one, two, three, four, if you had a magic wand and had as much time
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.560]   as possible, where would you want to be spending it?
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.600]   And then just like circle the top one and figure out like, well, how do I make time
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.120]   for that most important thing?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.160]   And if you look at that list and there is no deviation from the way your life actually
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.480]   is and the way your days actually are, then it doesn't matter.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.560]   And you don't have to get comfortable with the discomfort or any of that.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.960]   Like you can just keep doing things as they are.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:13.120]   We sort of think like you want to apply more and more tactics if you feel like that list
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.760]   is more out of whack with what's actually happening.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.040]   And if you feel like there is an important thing and I'm not getting to it, then you
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.440]   have to maybe get into this zone of getting comfortable with the discomfort, because that
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.560]   feeling of I can't start working yet because there's this pile of stuff and I need to clear
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:37.920]   the decks, you can get comfortable with that feeling of the decks being messy and get into
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.200]   the zone anyway.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.400]   It's just one of those things.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.640]   It's like that saying, like, you know, if you the more time you spend outside your comfort
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.160]   zone, the bigger your comfort zone gets and you can get comfortable with the mess of the
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.920]   stuff that doesn't really matter so that you can focus on what's most important.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.120]   But it'll take a few reps.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:04.000]   I think if you want to make a habit of clearing the decks work, then it's really important
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.400]   to constrain it along two dimensions.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.440]   One is time and the other is channels.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:15.200]   So it has to truly be time bound, because one of the big challenges with clearing the
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.960]   decks is that the amount of stuff that is on your deck will always increase.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.440]   There will always be something else to look at or to take care of.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:27.840]   And then constraining it along the line of channels allows you to say, OK, I'm not going
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.960]   to read the news in the morning.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.400]   Like the news actually isn't like that's not actually going to change what I do during
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:32.960]   the day.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.800]   But maybe email is important.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.400]   Maybe Slack is important.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.760]   And I do this.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.560]   I have one of the habits that Reclaim schedules for me every morning is called pre-check.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:47.920]   And it's 30 minutes only and it's email only.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.520]   And I do this because I have decided that in my job, my minimum viable frequency for
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.200]   email is about four hours.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.560]   So I can't go from the end of the day until the next day lunch.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.240]   That would be too long for me to go.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.960]   If there's an email from a founder that we're sort of working with or trying to invest in,
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:13.920]   there's an email from a potential LP in our fund who's expecting us to follow up.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:18.240]   So I've kind of hacked that and accounted for that by having this pre-check block.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.320]   But it's very, very tightly constrained.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   It's only 30 minutes and it's only email.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.600]   Yeah, another thing that's worked well for me, which was hard to get comfortable with
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.560]   is you make this list that you said, Jake, or you put down all the things that are important.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.400]   And I feel like you have to be really ruthless about the projects that you haven't made time
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   for about whether you actually want to do them.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:45.360]   And so if you look at my macro to do list, which is just like project level, I'm like,
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.440]   if something's been on there for three months and I haven't done it, sometimes the answer
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.400]   isn't make time for it.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.560]   Sometimes the answer is like, let's just cut bait.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.280]   Like this is not a project that I clearly prioritize.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.080]   This is not an email that I actually want to respond to.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.640]   And let's just not do it.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.880]   And that has become harder and harder to get comfortable with.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.720]   But once you get comfortable with it, it's really freeing.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.360]   And I know a friend of ours that we both all worked with, Kevin Rose, he was really good
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.080]   a few times at like, "I got all these emails.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.200]   I don't really want to respond to them.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.680]   Command A, archive all."
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.200]   I'm not suggesting people go to that extreme all the time.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.440]   But when there's a project that you have been pushing off and pushing off, if it's an option
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.640]   to not do it, that is a potentially viable option.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:40.160]   And maybe it's counterintuitive, but adopting some of these tactics of saying, "I am going
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.680]   to identify a highlight each day.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.800]   I am going to focus on one thing at a time.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.120]   I am going to make a list of what's important to me."
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:53.520]   That actually makes it easier to decide when something isn't going to happen because you've
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.640]   created a system for yourself.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.080]   This is my system for what I spend time on.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.600]   And if there's something that clearly doesn't fit the system, it's uncomfortable for sure.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.040]   But I find it easier to say, "Okay, it doesn't fit.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.080]   It hasn't fit for three months.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.120]   It hasn't fit for a year.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.080]   It's not going to happen."
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:16.000]   Instead of, I think if you operate in the conventional productivity paradigm of like,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.680]   "Well, if I just get organized enough, I just get efficient enough, I can do everything."
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.880]   Then it's like, there's always a chance.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.360]   You're always like, you keep hope alive for that thing on your list that maybe shouldn't
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.080]   be there at all, like you said, Chris.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.560]   Lots of tactics to focus on things.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.720]   What's required for this focus is energy.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.840]   Let's talk about some ways that we can recharge ourselves.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.640]   As much as it's about time and dividing things up, it's really about energy.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.000]   It's about having the energy to do the thing and dive into it and get into that zone that
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.240]   you described, Chris, where you're just like, "In an hour, I can do what normally might
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.280]   have taken me weeks to do because I was so locked in."
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.760]   So much of that is actually about physical energy.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.280]   The brain is a part of the body.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:09.600]   Whatever the tactics are, getting very conscious about that is related to the work that you
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.440]   do or the time that you spend with your loved ones or the time that you spend doing this
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.440]   hobby or activity that you really care about.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.200]   The way you sleep, the way you eat, the way you caffeinate or don't, when you walk and
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.440]   take a break and reset your brain, all these things have a powerful effect on what you
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.280]   can actually do with your mind.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.880]   Some of them we've done full deep dives on, but what are some of the highlights of tactics
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.920]   around energy that people might not already know?
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:43.200]   We had the opportunity when we were at GV to work with Blue Bottle Coffee.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:49.040]   And there were, as you might expect, some real coffee nerds at Blue Bottle.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:55.920]   And there was this one guy in particular, Ryan Brown, that we worked with who had done
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:01.520]   a bunch of research himself on caffeine and how the body actually processes caffeine.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.280]   And maybe people listening know this already, but caffeine doesn't give you energy.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.600]   It basically prevents you from getting tired.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:15.360]   So there's like a hormone that binds with the receptor in your brain and tells you it's
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.080]   time to be tired.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.960]   And caffeine blocks that binding.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:29.200]   And the thing that Jake actually turned me on to that I recently started doing is not
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.000]   having coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.600]   So when you have coffee first thing in the morning, your body learns that it needs that
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.920]   in order to wake up.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.520]   And so it sort of like blunts the effectiveness of it.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.400]   Coffee, you become more addicted to it and the caffeine is less effective.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:54.000]   But if you can wait an hour or two hours or three hours to have your first cup of coffee,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.080]   you'll wake up better.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:00.480]   You'll actually have a better kind of energy first thing in the morning.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.920]   And then if you want that additional boost from caffeine, if you want to experience that
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.800]   sort of "energy giving" effect of caffeine, you have it a few hours after you've been
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.440]   awake.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.200]   It's way, way more effective.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.880]   And so that's one that I think it's not obvious.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.200]   And certainly the default of how most people consume caffeine first thing in the morning
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.400]   is different.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:28.240]   But that was an interesting thing that we learned about that took me a long time to
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.520]   really implement in my own life.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.720]   But I like it a lot.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.760]   That has had a huge effect on my days.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.360]   And it's always important to say with caffeine that it affects people differently.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.880]   And there's this huge population.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.520]   Like, I have friends who are Swedish who can drink coffee.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.640]   Like, they just start the day, they're drinking just black coffee, like water all day long,
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.000]   you know, right up till they go to bed.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.960]   No problem.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.320]   For me, it's not like that at all.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.000]   And I have to be mindful of it.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.040]   And spacing out and really picking those spots.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.080]   I think of it like if you're playing Super Mario Kart and you've got like the mushroom,
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.480]   like the turbo boost, and you want to pick like the right moment, like the straightaway
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.440]   to get that boost.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:10.400]   If I burn up my mushroom, you know, and the turns in the beginning, that's like the first
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.040]   one out of the bag.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.000]   It's like it's a waste.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.040]   It's a waste.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:21.440]   So the caffeine timing for most of us, I think, is a really big deal and really worth experimenting
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.840]   on for your highlights.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   My caffeine optimization is quite different because I don't really drink caffeine and
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.360]   I don't drink coffee.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.160]   But one time, so I never really liked the taste of coffee.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.880]   And one time I went to Starbucks, I was like, "I don't know what to order."
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.640]   And so someone was like, "You should get a Nitro Cold Brew."
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.840]   And I was like, "I don't know what that is."
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   So I ordered it.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.160]   And best I can understand, a very large Nitro Cold Brew is like drinking two or three coffees,
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:44.320]   right?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.080]   It's way more than you need.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:50.720]   And it put me in this like, I felt like I had taken a drug.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.040]   And I actually felt like I could focus.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.720]   But I've saved that.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.040]   And it's like a one or two time a year thing.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.040]   I'm like, "Wow, I can't find the focus.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:04.400]   Let's use it almost like as a drug, not as a thing every day."
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.840]   I'm not sure if I want to recommend that.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.080]   But that is my experience.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:17.200]   Another tactic that might be a little new to people is called leave your headphones at
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:17.680]   home.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:26.160]   AirPods have created this incredible default at the intersection of culture, what's culturally
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.320]   acceptable, socially acceptable and technology.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:28.960]   It's so easy.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.680]   They're so light.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.720]   They're so delightful to use that you leave the house.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.440]   You're going for a walk.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.400]   You're going to the store.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.560]   You put your AirPods in, which is great.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.040]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.240]   I do it all the time.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:46.320]   But there's kind of this surprising and novel kind of clarity and calm that comes if you
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.400]   just leave the headphones at home.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.440]   You're going for a walk.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.360]   You're going to run errands, and you just don't have your headphones.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.320]   I mean, it sounds so obvious that it even has to be a tactic.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:01.920]   But we have found that when the default is to always be listening to something, to always
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.200]   be consuming, to say, "Oh, well, I can't have downtime.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.800]   I need to make good use of that time by learning something," whatever, if you can change that
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:17.040]   default and use that instead as an opportunity to recharge and to re-energize, it can be
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.440]   helpful.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.280]   Where do breaks and exercise and all that fit into our ability to focus?
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.040]   Well, they're really important.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.880]   We can't be on all the time.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.560]   And this is something that John and I noticed when we have run design sprints.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.040]   In the earliest days of doing it, we didn't have a schedule yet.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:42.080]   We didn't yet know sort of what the structure of the day should be, how long we should go.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:47.440]   And our tendency was-- so the notion with a design sprint is we're working with a team
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.960]   who's starting a big project.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:54.560]   We want to help them go from sort of zero to a prototype that we're testing with customers
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.760]   by the end of the week.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.000]   So you've got a team of three, four, five, six, seven people, something like that.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.080]   For us, it's a startup usually, but people have adopted this in all kinds of places.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:10.080]   And we have a lot to accomplish in a week to get there, to get from zero on this project
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   to a prototype that's realistic that you can test with people.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.840]   There's a lot to accomplish.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:19.360]   At first, our instinct was, well, we need to work the longest days and cram in the most
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:19.600]   time.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.080]   So quick breaks, long hours.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:29.520]   Over time, we learned we actually get more done if we work in these sort of focused blocks
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.960]   of 60 to 90 minutes.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.320]   And we have long breaks in between those blocks.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:40.480]   So up to like 30 minutes where people can walk, have a snack, really kind of do some
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.800]   of that reset that we're just talking about without the headphones.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.080]   And then come back and do another session.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:50.800]   And so this notion that you have like 60 to 90 minutes for a highlight, it kind of comes
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.320]   it's informed by that observation that we saw teams reach their peak performance when
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.320]   they were working in those blocks, taking a big break, doing another block, taking a
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.120]   big break.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.920]   And so that would make a case for kind of stepping away from your desk, like going on
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.240]   a walk in the middle of the day, kind of just breaking up the day.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.280]   What about kind of more exercise?
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.240]   I feel like something that I'm sure is not unique to me is like, oh, I really want to
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.560]   work out, but I just got so much stuff to do.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.640]   So maybe if I can like just catch up and and it seems like the overwhelming theme is like,
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.440]   you'll never catch up.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.720]   So stop trying to catch up.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.160]   But how do you guys think about exercise in your own lives?
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   A couple of ways.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:35.840]   I think there's I share your, your sentiment, Chris, which is that exercise is something
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.720]   that I, I really want to do is very important to me.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:44.720]   But it if I don't have kind of a structure around it, it often slips to the end of the
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.480]   day or it doesn't it doesn't happen.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:55.680]   So, you know, in the book, we actually recommended kind of finding a way to exercise
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:02.560]   on your own, you know, sort of not depending on a trainer or a gym or some some external
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   setting in order to exercise, but rather to find a way to exercise on your own.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:11.120]   And I've actually changed my my tune on that, not because it's ineffective, but because
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.720]   I found that more often than not, I just wasn't getting to it.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.120]   It wasn't it wasn't as important or didn't seem as urgent to me as other things.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:26.800]   And so I've started working with a trainer for a few reasons, partially because they're
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.320]   they're very good at what they do and they help me with some specific challenges that
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:30.720]   I have.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.320]   But but also because now it's scheduled, right?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:39.680]   It's I am accountable to that person and that person has a full schedule of their own.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:44.000]   And so I if I if I cancel with them, it's not like I can just, you know, reschedule
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.880]   any time I want.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.320]   And so I know that it's important to to keep that that that commitment.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:56.320]   So so that's something that I've done to help me make sure that I am making time to
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.120]   exercise.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:02.640]   But I think there's another there's another view of it for us, which is that exercise
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:09.120]   is not just something that like you you should do or that you need to do to stay healthy,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.480]   but that it's actually like a tool you can use to build energy.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:18.400]   And, you know, I'm sure that, you know, anybody in your audience has experienced the
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.200]   feeling of, you know, being stuck and, you know, taking a break or going to take a walk
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.520]   to clear their head or just sort of this this sense that when you when you start moving
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.000]   and you get away from the desk, like it, it just kind of gives you a new kind of energy,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.480]   a new, you know, sort of a boost.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.000]   And so, you know, that's that's kind of another view of it is is you can use exercise
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.720]   to actively give you energy to make it easier to then come back refreshed and really focus
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.800]   on the things that you want to make time for.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.080]   Yeah, one thing that just made me realize when I go to run, I sometimes have all kinds
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:54.560]   of ideas.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.280]   I know every time I'm running, I'm like, gosh, I wish I wish I could just write these
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:57.760]   ideas down.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.360]   So I like sometimes I'll pull out the notes app and I'm like trying to run, trying to
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   write down an idea just so I don't miss it.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.160]   Another time I was like, should I just bring a Sharpie and start writing on my arm?
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.160]   Or it's always dawned on me that that is probably because I'm not distracted, right?
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.280]   Like I'm running.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   I'm not sitting there scrolling social media.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:13.760]   I can't do that.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.320]   I'm running.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.920]   So I just have to be with my thoughts.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.120]   And oh, and I'm with my thoughts.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.880]   Sometimes I come up with really interesting things.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.400]   It's never dawned on me that you could just create that.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.800]   It's like, oh, well, what if I just stopped using the social media ads?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.240]   It sounds so obvious.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.480]   But I was like, I just love that experience.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.120]   And in my mind, I was like, I should just run more, you know, like not there's another
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.800]   way to get to that state.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:41.520]   I think that we will all be better off if we can exercise in some way every day.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520]   And the exercise, it can be a walk.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.720]   It doesn't have to be a Herculean feat.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:52.160]   And in fact, for myself, I've found it's better if I don't do those Herculean exercise
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.480]   things, that's going to usually be a recipe for me, like hurting myself and then stopping
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.040]   the program or wearing myself out too much and not being able to focus.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.120]   But a regular whatever you can do that you can fit in.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.560]   And I think for most people, you'll benefit from it more in the morning.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.080]   Then I benefit from that time that you just described, Chris, like that that brain time
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.520]   and that the sort of cognitive boost that I get afterwards.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.200]   I get to enjoy that all day long.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.920]   It's it's really powerful.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.160]   And it's, you know, there are obviously many reasons to exercise for our health and longevity
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.720]   and so forth.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.080]   But just if you think about it as an equation for what can help you focus, what can help
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.040]   you do your work the best or bring the best attention to the people in the projects you
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   care about, it's it's a great way to to get more out of each day.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.960]   There are a lot of tactics.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.120]   I'm like, there's no way we're getting through all of them.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.160]   So I'm going to move us on to some reflecting and how you guys think about that process.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.880]   We talked briefly about it, but maybe tactically, what do we do to reflect?
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:06.480]   I think the most basic reflecting is just asking yourself, like, how did the day go?
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.920]   Like, how did I feel today?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.800]   What did I spend time on?
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.560]   Was that what I wanted to spend time on?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:19.200]   And we in the back of the book and make time, we have a template for that.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.640]   It's actually it's on our website, too.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.440]   So it's it's free.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.640]   You don't have to buy the book to get it, but it's a simple template that you can use
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.920]   if it's helpful to just sort of walk you through each of those questions.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:36.720]   But I think that the the more important aspect of reflecting is to then think about what
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.320]   you're going to do differently tomorrow, because, you know, if you get in this habit of treating
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.160]   each day as an experiment, you can sort of look back and say, OK, how did it go?
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.920]   Did I make time for the things that I wanted to?
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.480]   And then if not, well, what am I going to do differently tomorrow?
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.320]   And, you know, you can use the tactics in the book or you can, you know, get inspired
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:00.400]   by other things that you that, you know, come to mind or that you read about, you hear about.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.560]   But being somewhat deliberate about what you're going to do next is kind of the that's the
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.320]   secret to propelling this this daily experiment cycle.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.840]   And over time, then getting to a point where you're not just like reading a book and following
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   some advice from from us, but you're actually like constructing your own system.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.440]   You're making your own personalized system that's based on results from your own life,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.040]   based on the things that have actually worked for you and that you are confident work for
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.200]   you, that you enjoy doing.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:37.840]   And so that's that's kind of both the mechanics of reflect, but also the bigger philosophy
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.680]   of why we think it's important.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.600]   You can honestly just you can think about it as like you're playing Super Mario Brothers
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.800]   and it's like every day you you're at the end of a level.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.080]   And I mean, you either died or you're at the end of you got through the level.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.720]   And like maybe you didn't get through the level, but you went into a warp zone or something.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.840]   And like, you know, you change your highlight, you went a different direction.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.280]   But if you didn't make it through, if you look back and you're like, that did not go
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.240]   the way I wanted to.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.000]   If you think of it as like, oh, I didn't measure up, I suck like you're not going to be having
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.880]   a good time, but hopefully people don't feel that way when they're playing Super Mario
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.120]   Brothers.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.040]   You're like, man, that Goomba got me or like whatever, like the Koopa Troopa.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:15.840]   I ran right into him.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.160]   I got to do next time.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.480]   I'm going to just jump a little bit sooner.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.080]   I'm going to jump a little bit higher, whatever.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.200]   And that's the way I think you can think about it.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.000]   It's just like, oh, we tried one thing.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.280]   Did it work or not?
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.160]   And if it didn't work, what might I correct about it?
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.720]   Because there's all these bad guys who are against me.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:43.200]   And I feel like in the world of all of the distractions and all of the social expectations
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.720]   and all of the things that we pile on ourselves and expect ourselves to do, those are all
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.160]   bad guys that we have to avoid.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.280]   And if we trip up for a day and if the bad guys get us, it's not necessarily this intrinsic
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.560]   problem with us.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.640]   We're all going to have days like that.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.240]   I have them all the time.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.280]   It's just, okay, the old system wasn't working for me.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.000]   I need to adapt.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.680]   Things are new, or I'm trying to set up this new thing and it's not clicking yet.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.280]   What am I going to change tomorrow?
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.600]   And it can be as simple as that.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.680]   It sounds like even though you guys wrote the book and practice this daily, you still
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.960]   have days where you don't get stuff done that you want to.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:18.900]   Constantly.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.680]   It's a constant battle for me.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.360]   And I'm constantly getting distracted by stuff.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.240]   You'd be like, "Really?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.040]   You wrote a book on this and you're getting distracted by what you're doing right now?"
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:27.760]   All the time.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.560]   It's just like, I'm the worst.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.760]   I'm the absolute worst.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:39.440]   How do you take someone who's really easily distractible and very poor self-control and
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.240]   get anything done?
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.000]   Make time is that for me.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.400]   Where would you send people, and if that's different types of people, to follow up on
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.680]   everything you're doing from character to make time to anything else?
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.400]   I think it depends on what you're looking for.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:01.840]   If you are specifically interested in getting started with some of these tactics, go to
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.640]   maketime.blog, which is our website.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.280]   And there's a bunch of easy ways to start.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.640]   There's a bunch of free resources.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.000]   You can go as deep or stay as shallow as you want.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.480]   We've talked a bunch about the work that we do with founders.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.040]   We invest in startups.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.400]   We love working with founders when they're at the earliest stages of building their companies.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.080]   And we do that through our VC firm, Character.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.000]   Our website is character.vc.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.200]   And one thing that's really exciting in the Character world is that twice a year, we run
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.880]   a program called Character Labs.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.120]   It's basically our version of a startup accelerator where we apply a lot of these
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:43.520]   lessons.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.800]   We apply lessons from the hundreds of design sprints that we've run with companies.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:54.480]   And we tailored this program to help people who are just getting started building something
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.760]   new.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:01.040]   And so if you're at that stage, if you're in those early days, you should also check
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:01.920]   out Character Labs.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.560]   And it's a cool opportunity to work with us as you're starting a new business.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.680]   Yeah, as someone who has worked with you, with portfolio companies and my own, I can
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:17.200]   fully endorse and recommend anyone go do that.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.800]   If it's one of those two times a year, go wait for the next one.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.440]   Going through that design sprint process, yes, you can read the book and try to do it
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:25.920]   yourself.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.480]   But going through it with someone who's done it is just one of the most interesting
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.040]   experiences you can have when you're building a company.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.000]   Thank you for saying that.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   And it's also what's fun for us.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.120]   And I think where we can have a big impact for founders is not just in leading them through
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:41.760]   the process.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.920]   Because like you said, they can read the book, they can do it.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.640]   But we get to contribute ideas then, right?
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.480]   If we were a normal investor, and we talked to a founder once a month, they were on the
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.880]   board or whatever, we throw out an idea like, "Hey, did you consider this?
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.160]   What if you did it that way?"
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.680]   It's hard to really have an impact in that way.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.080]   But when we're running a sprint with the founders of a startup, with the core team of
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.680]   that startup, it creates an opportunity for us to bring our experience as designers and
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.080]   writers and contribute those ideas directly.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.760]   So we're literally making sketches, we're writing copy, we're working on mockups and
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.240]   prototypes for those founders.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.440]   So that's, I think, one of the things that's really unique about working in this way with
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.660]   founders.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.960]   I don't have a startup right now, or I'd be knocking on the door.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.480]   You do.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.000]   This is a kind of a startup, Chris.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:36.480]   And come on.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.600]   I don't have a venue.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.400]   I'm not raising money.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.440]   Awesome.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.800]   Thank you guys so much for being here.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.320]   Thanks, Chris.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:51.200]   I'm such a big fan of all the hacks, and so this is really a treat to get to be on the
