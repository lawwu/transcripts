[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   A second question comes in from Rick Siegel who serves as the vice president
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.080]   of advancement and the distinguished lecturer of commerce and vocation at
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.120]   Bethlehem College and Seminary. He asks this, "Pastor John, is it sinful to be a
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.640]   high net worth individual, defined as assets minus liabilities being greater
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.480]   than 1 million US dollars? Here's the scenario. God blesses a Christian's
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.600]   personal industry with fruitfulness in the form of a large annual income. The
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.000]   biblical wartime lifestyle, as I may be admittedly misunderstanding it, would
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.640]   have this person use a portion of that income to meet modestly constructed
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.360]   needs, including the setting aside of similarly modest rain day reserves, and
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.040]   then give the rest to ministry, especially for the care of the poor.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   This person would not accumulate assets in such a model and therefore would
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   neither be nor ever become a high net worth individual, only by God's grace a
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.160]   highly paid one during certain seasons. On the other hand, what about a Christian
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.600]   investor, the person who doesn't immediately give to Christian charity
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   all of the difference between a modest lifestyle and a large annual income, but
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.640]   who keeps it and with great attentiveness accumulates assets that
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   may produce future income and future charity beyond the immediate fruit of
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320]   his annual labor. What's the difference between desiring to be rich, 1 Timothy 6
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.080]   9, and skillfully, faithfully managing one's wealth in this manner? So let's get
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.360]   the powerful warning against the desire to be rich out on the table and then
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   clarify a few things about wartime lifestyle, because there's where the rub
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.800]   is. So Paul says, 1 Timothy 6 6, "Godliness with contentment is great gain, for we
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.060]   brought nothing into the world, we cannot take anything out of the world, but if we
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.000]   have food and clothing with these we will be content. But those who desire to
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.320]   desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction, for the love of money is the
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.720]   root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.160]   away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs." That's about
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.960]   as strong a warning about the desire to be rich as I could imagine. So let me
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.160]   clarify what I'm talking about with wartime way of life. The answer to the
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.880]   question is no. A wartime lifestyle does not mean that you, after providing
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.040]   yourself and your family with a modest housing, food, clothing, now you're obliged
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.000]   to give all the surplus away immediately. That's not what wartime lifestyle says.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.600]   Rather, the call for a wartime way of life says, with a lot more nuance and
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.680]   complexity, that the remainder of our resources, so after you've provided for
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360]   yourself those necessities, might be ten dollars, might be ten million dollars
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.080]   left over. That's the one that's being asked about. What's left over
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:25.100]   is managed, stewarded, for the good of others, the glory of God, the advancement
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.600]   of His saving and sanctifying and healing purposes in the world, rather than for
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.360]   personal aggrandizement. So that may mean a huge and immediate sacrificial gift.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   You may give all your surplus away when profits rise or you get a windfall or
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   whenever. Or it may mean, no, you don't give it all away. You build a large
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.760]   capital reserve for starting a foundation or for accompanying,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.800]   accomplishing some larger, longer-term goal for the good of the culture or the
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.880]   society. Wartime way of life, as opposed to merely simple lifestyle, is meant to
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.360]   call attention to the kinds of choices that are made when tanks and rifles and
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.840]   grenades and B-52 bombers are needed to defeat the Germans and Japanese in the
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.600]   war of aggression, World War II. The complexities, think of it, of constructing
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.160]   tanks and rifles and grenades and airplanes were enormous and expensive.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.560]   Factories for parts had to exist and massive paid labor force and logistical
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.540]   systems for transportation and delivery, all of it hugely costly. So, no, the
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.840]   answer is no. The building up of resources for the accomplishing of great
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.400]   and costly acts of love is not sinful. And it might be helpful just to
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.600]   draw this out a little more, not in relationship to any particular war, but
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.320]   rather ordinary business life in America. We live in a society in which many
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.200]   legitimate businesses depend on large concentrations of capital. You can't
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.800]   build a new manufacturing plant without millions of dollars in equity and
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.960]   therefore financial officers in these big businesses have the responsibility
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.140]   to build those reserves like they might sell shares to the community. And when
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.360]   the Bible condemns the desire to get rich, it's not necessarily condemning a
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.240]   business that aims to expand and therefore seeks larger capital reserves.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:01.160]   Now, the officers of the business may be greedy. They may be greedy for personal
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.800]   wealth or for power, but they may have large noble motives of how their
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   expanded productivity will create jobs and benefit people with products and
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.880]   services. It's not necessarily a greedy thing to want to amass that capital for
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.520]   the expansion of a new plant or something like that. Even if a person,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.160]   let's just get it down to the individual, even if a person because of his or her
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.280]   competency in business is offered a raise or a higher paying job and accepts
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.360]   it, that doesn't automatically mean that he or she is driven by the desire to get
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.600]   rich. They may have accepted the job because they don't crave the power or
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.080]   the status of luxuries, but rather they want to do good. They want to
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   build an adoption agency or give a scholarship or send a missionary or fund
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:07.680]   an inner-city ministry or something like that. So what Paul is warning against is
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   not the desire to earn money to meet our needs and the needs of others. He's
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.960]   warning against the desire to have more and more money for the security and the
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.760]   ego boost and the material luxuries it can provide with no plan for loving
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.960]   other people with your increase. That's what my effort to teach
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:39.120]   on wartime lifestyle is aiming to avoid. Very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And you
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.720]   may be listening to this episode and you find yourself on the opposite end of the
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.840]   economic spectrum. If that's you, you're not alone. Many listeners are facing
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.560]   financial hardships right now and even facing poverty. If that's you, we recorded
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.240]   an entire episode titled "Biblical Hope for Christians Facing Poverty." That was
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.680]   episode number 289 in the podcast archive. You can find that episode in the
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.440]   Ask Pastor John app for the iPhone and the Android, which is free of charge to
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.520]   you because we are supported by some very generous financial donors to the
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.400]   ministry of Desiring God. So what does a holistic life of worship look like at
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.040]   work and at school? Tomorrow Pastor John will explain. I'm your host Tony
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.900]   you
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.960]   you
