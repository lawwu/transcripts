[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Here's a moving and important and wise question from a mom.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.000]   "Pastor John, my name is Malia and I'm a new mother to a baby boy.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   I've been thinking about the concept of suffering in relation to my son.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   It will be so hard to watch him suffer, but I know that he will face it one day and probably
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.160]   already does in his own baby way.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.840]   My question is simple.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.280]   How do I prepare him for and raise him to handle suffering?
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.920]   What are some practical ways for young parents to teach children that suffering is part of
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.560]   life and that we can trust God in it?"
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.840]   I would sum up my answer in three steps.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.800]   One, teach your son a glorious, all-encompassing, biblical worldview that puts suffering in
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   its proper place.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   So teaching.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.720]   Number two, discipline him with appropriate firmness and require of him self-denial.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   One is teach.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   Number two is discipline.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.480]   And third, model for him trust and joy in the midst of your own suffering and sorrow.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520]   So let me take those one at a time and just give a little bit of fleshing out on some
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   Bible.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.160]   Number one, teach your son a glorious, all-encompassing, biblical worldview that has suffering in its
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.240]   proper place.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.200]   When I think of what that worldview would include, let me just give six components.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.680]   One, the world God created, created good, including our own hearts and bodies, was broken
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.440]   and made vulnerable and imperfect by the fall of humankind into sin.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.040]   All of sin that fall glory, fall short of the glory of God.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.600]   Things are not the way they should be.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.360]   We teach our children that.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.960]   The basic reason they're not is sin.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.280]   Death came into the world through sin.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.480]   Suffering came with it.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.120]   The whole creation is groaning and waiting for what God is going to do later.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.200]   So we teach the brokenness of the world.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.260]   Number two, we teach our children that everyone suffers therefore.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:15.000]   And since those who trust and follow Jesus are at odds with the sinful system of the
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   world, Christians often suffer most.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.080]   Acts 14.22, through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.960]   Psalm 34.19, many are the afflictions of the righteous.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.560]   John 15.20, if they persecuted Jesus, they're going to persecute you.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.920]   John 16.33, in the world you will have trouble.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.600]   Romans 8.23, we all are groaning, waiting for our bodies to be renewed.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.280]   So we're all going to suffer, especially Christians.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   Three, God is sovereign and nothing can stop him from doing what he wants to do most.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.120]   I am God and there is none like me saying my counsel will stand.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   I will accomplish all my purpose.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.280]   Isaiah 46.10, he is stronger than the weather.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.060]   He's stronger than storms and floods and lightning.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.200]   He's stronger than animals, big ones that can attack you like lions and little teeny
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   microscopic ones you can't even see that can make you sick and even kill you.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.320]   He's stronger than all the enemies that we have.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560]   He's stronger than everything.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.720]   Children need to hear this.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   They get it.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   They'll embrace it more quickly than we do and they can handle the mysteries.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.380]   Yes, they can.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.160]   Don't ever give the impression to your son that suffering exists because God is helpless.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   Number four, make the gospel crystal clear, the gospel crystal clear that God sent his
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.720]   son into the world to suffer with us and for us.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   This means that if we trust him, none of our suffering is punishment for sin.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.840]   Christ bore all our punishment for sin as the basis of our acceptance with God and our
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.320]   hope for heaven and there will be no more suffering there.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.960]   All the suffering therefore that comes into the life of a Christian is not because God
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   is punishing him in his wrath.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   Don't let children understand this, but rather it is God's fatherly discipline for the sake
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.240]   of holiness as Hebrews 12 and first Peter 1 5 says.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.900]   Number five, therefore in all of our suffering, God is good.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.120]   God is wise.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.040]   God is loving, even though painful and he has purposes for us.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.800]   Romans 8 28, we never explain suffering by saying God is helpless or that Satan got the
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.780]   upper hand or that there are mere accidents in the world.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.360]   We always handle suffering, our suffering by saying, even though we don't understand
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.200]   all the answers for why this particular suffering came or this particular suffering came at
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.240]   this particular time or this particular intensity, we don't understand those particulars.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.120]   Nevertheless, we do understand what God has taught us, namely that he's sovereign, that
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.440]   he's good, and he always has purposes for our everlasting joy.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.840]   And the last thing that's part of this overarching worldview is the day is coming when God will
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.980]   set everything right.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.800]   If it looks like any evil person is getting away with something in this life, he will
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.160]   not get away with it because God will bring him into judgment in the end.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   Vengeance is mine.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.740]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.560]   And for every good deed that looks like it did not get repaid or got suffering instead
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:46.480]   of blessing, Luke 14 14, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.400]   So week in and week out, we teach these things to our children.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.320]   Speaking of them, when we rise up and when we drive in the car and when we sit at table
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.840]   and when we go to bed at night, saturate your child with this worldview.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:10.760]   Number two, we discipline our children with appropriate firmness and we require self-denial.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.560]   Fathers do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   of the Lord.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.440]   Not only instruction, but also discipline.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   Proverbs 13 24, whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.400]   to discipline him.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.000]   And one of the reasons I think that's true, that we hate our children if we don't discipline
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.520]   them that way, even though it'll get you arrested in some countries or worse, get your children
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.240]   taken away from you, is that coddling children with no physical repercussions to their defiant
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.760]   behavior is preparing them to be unable to recognize the discipline of God in their lives
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.880]   when it comes in physical forms.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.200]   And it will come in physical forms.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.360]   And we are doing them a great disservice if we haven't shown them how a loving parent
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.720]   can lovingly spank a disobedient child.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.840]   And in general, children should be taught self-denial.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.320]   That is, they should not get everything they want.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.760]   Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5, just like patience and sacrificial love.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   And no one can be a Christian without it, because our fallen nature must be denied,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.180]   put to death, as Paul says.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.240]   As long as we live, we must put to death sinful desires.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:51.000]   We need to habituate our children to lifelong patterns of saying no to selfish desires.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.560]   The inability to do this is the reason thousands of kids are destroyed in life.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.760]   So don't do that to your child.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.700]   Teach them self-denial.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.760]   And the last thing I would say, and this may be, it's hard to rank these, but it may be
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.800]   the most important.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.960]   We should model for our children trust and joy in the midst of our own suffering and
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   sorrows.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.240]   They are watching.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.760]   Romans 5, 3, "We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance."
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.360]   And James 1, 2, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet various trials."
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:40.400]   Nothing will be more powerful in the life of your children than your example of trust
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.320]   and joy in the midst of your own disappointments and sufferings.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.960]   In fact, I would say that the greatest challenge of parenting, at least I look back over, what,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   I parent 42 years or something like that so far.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.720]   The greatest challenge of parenting is not primarily remembering all the things that
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:13.000]   should be taught, the catechism, but primarily a parent growing in grace and humility and
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.680]   trust and joy in all the ups and downs of life.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.640]   Few things will have a greater power in our children's lives to help them suffer as Christians.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.120]   That's a great word, Pastor John.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120]   Thank you.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.720]   We should never, never give our children the impression that suffering exists because God
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   is helpless.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.440]   That's a powerful point.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.480]   On a related note, we talked about the Boudinario case, which is a family in Norway whose children
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.600]   were taken away for spanking.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.760]   We addressed that case in episode number 879, "Spanking is Illegal in My Country, Now What?"
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.700]   And also in episodes 442 and 443, I talked with guest Ted Tripp about why some parents
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.940]   discipline and why others don't.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.780]   You might be helped by those episodes, episodes 442 and 443.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.660]   All of those episodes and about a thousand more can be found in our podcast archive at

[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.620]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
