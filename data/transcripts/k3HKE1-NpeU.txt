[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - I want to go and pretend for a moment
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.040]   that you have no followers.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.080]   No one knows who you are.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.920]   - No one knows I am.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.740]   - No one.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.580]   And you're traveling.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.420]   - Yes.
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.240]   - And I want to know,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.360]   one of the things I think you're most well known for
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.720]   is building community and meeting people
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.240]   and connecting the world.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.960]   How would you go about doing that from scratch
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.400]   if you were in a new place, a new culture, traveling?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.540]   - I love traveling.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.640]   And I happen to have been not famous
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.000]   for like 27 years of my life, okay?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800]   So this is just a recent phenomenon,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   like five years old, right?
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.060]   So I know how it's like to travel to like 30, 40 countries
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.080]   without nobody knowing me.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   But I found out that the best way to travel
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.220]   is to go to hostels.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.640]   And I like strategically now,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.440]   when I didn't have money and when I had money,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.320]   strategically would go to hostels
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.720]   and I would check in in a hostel,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.160]   ideally at a dorm, not at a private room,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.860]   because you want to have like these random interactions
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.560]   with people that end up leading to friendships,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.920]   let's go explore together.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.720]   And then I would spend like a crazy amount of time
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.440]   in the lobby of the hostel
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   in the hopes of just like randomly meeting somebody.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.860]   And then you just need that one person
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.960]   that's also in a very uncomfortable position just like you.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.240]   And both of you decide,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.040]   hey, let's go explore this country together.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.760]   And when you have one person, it's easier to find the third.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.160]   And when you have three, it's easy to find the fourth, right?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.180]   So it's all about getting that one partner
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.540]   to want to explore the country with you.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420]   And so every country I went to,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.420]   I would literally just go to the hostels to make the friends
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.820]   not to stay at the hotel.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.980]   I don't care about staying in the hostels,
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.060]   just to make the friends.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.220]   - So you'd go to a hostel,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.980]   potentially even book a room and not stay in it.
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.220]   - Yes, I did that before.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.540]   - Because I imagine sometimes
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.180]   if you were traveling with your partner,
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.180]   what would you do?
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340]   - Oh, so the second tip
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.060]   is to not travel with your partner.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.900]   - Okay.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   - Yeah, so when I started traveling
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.000]   and I have never enjoyed traveling with a partner
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.920]   if you are trying to make friends.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.400]   So the minute I became sort of self-sufficient in a way,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.600]   like I started traveling with a partner,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.480]   but I find it actually really important to travel single.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.320]   - Okay.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.640]   - Is that, do you agree or disagree with that?
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.920]   - No, I think it depends.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.520]   My wife and I love to explore places together.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760]   So I have that kind of player two
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.600]   to go on these trips with.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   - But you're never gonna get player three.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.800]   - Yeah, sometimes we went-
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.160]   - It's gonna be weird as a third wheel.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.180]   - Well, we went to South Africa
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.900]   and we wanted to explore by car and we were cheap.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.740]   And we were like, well,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.540]   a car holds more than two people, so what do we do?
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.700]   And we met these two Swedish guys
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.260]   and the four of us together bought a tent,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.980]   rented a car, bought four sleeping bags.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.300]   And we drove around for three weeks
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.940]   through Namibia and Botswana and Zambia
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.820]   and South Africa as a team of four.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.780]   Those two player twos.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.660]   We didn't find the three,
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.740]   but we found the three and the four together.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.380]   But they were both single guys.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.120]   They were not in a relationship though.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   - That's interesting.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.180]   - We had a third and fourth wheel to our-
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.140]   - Third and fourth wheel.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.660]   But that is significantly harder
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.920]   than if you were by yourself, correct?
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.760]   - Totally.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.460]   But your strategy seems to be trying to engage with
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.460]   and meet people who are also traveling.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.180]   How do you try to engage and meet people local
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.700]   to the community and learn more about their culture?
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.560]   - Yeah, so I found that school networks
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.080]   were also very, very helpful.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.220]   So I graduated from Harvard
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.500]   and the alumni network is really global.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.620]   And Harvard people tend to stick together
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.460]   because they think they're better than others.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.400]   So I hope no one's listening to this.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.740]   But so I try to check local Harvard clubs.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.020]   And if I know a friend that is from that country,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.940]   like on Facebook.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.700]   You know, remember the time of the social graph on Facebook
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.500]   where you can just search who are my,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900]   which one of my friends is now in Botswana
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.820]   or lives in Botswana.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.140]   And you'd get a couple of people
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.740]   in every one of these countries.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.900]   And that's really all you need.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.560]   It's all about getting the hook.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.980]   The one person that will open the doors to you
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.780]   for to meet the next 10 people.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.600]   That's how I think about it.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.580]   So I just find the hook in the first two days
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.180]   and then the hook takes care of everything else.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.300]   They find me the next 10 people.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   - Do you ever find the hook
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.100]   just like at a bar, at a restaurant?
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.700]   'Cause I think that's what people assume.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.860]   They assume I'm gonna go to a bar
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.580]   and I'm gonna randomly talk to a stranger
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.260]   and now I'm gonna go on a adventure.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.060]   - That's how you find the hook up, not the hook.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.900]   - Okay, okay.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.300]   - So I found it very difficult to meet people at a restaurant
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   'cause you're sitting down the whole time.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.900]   How do you meet people at a restaurant?
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.500]   Or a bar or an event like that?
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380]   Maybe not a restaurant.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.420]   - Yeah, no, I had no success in this.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.340]   - Okay.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.280]   Is there something every time you go to a new country
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.980]   that you try to make sure you do?
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.940]   - It was by nature of my job,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.740]   but I try to make videos as much as possible
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.000]   of every place I go to.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.620]   Because I found that when you travel,
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.040]   you're making so many memories,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.340]   but you'll forget these memories
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.780]   if you don't take videos of them.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.780]   So really, for me, travel is a form of archiving.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.820]   Literally, I feel like I have my camera with me at all time
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.140]   like memorize, memorize, memorize, memorize,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.460]   'cause you wanna not forget this experience.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.820]   So that's how I became a video maker
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.380]   and traveling video maker.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.300]   - How do you make sure you're not just living
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.120]   behind the camera when you're traveling?
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.700]   - I am living behind the camera when I'm traveling.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.820]   Who said I'm not?
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.220]   - Okay, okay.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.140]   - Do you make content when you travel?
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.980]   - Almost never.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.340]   - Almost never?
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.720]   - I make content about the travels.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.660]   So I'll go to a country,
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.300]   come back and talk about the experience.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.140]   - You're kidding.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.620]   - But I'm not making them...
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.100]   I mean, I made a video once in a country
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.840]   talking about how I got there,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.460]   but I don't know, I wanna be there
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.900]   and I don't wanna be distracted
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.460]   from wandering around and seeing things,
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.700]   thinking about, "Oh, what, I gotta go record this thing."
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.320]   For me, that seems like it'd be overwhelming.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.620]   - Wow, that's interesting.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.180]   Well, I guess you and I travel differently.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.620]   We should start to travel together one day.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.460]   - I would like to see what that goes.
