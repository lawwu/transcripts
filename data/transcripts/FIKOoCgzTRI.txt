[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   A couple of different listeners in the past month have written in to ask essentially the
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.960]   same thing and it's this. Is it possible to become legalistic about not being legalistic?
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.680]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   My short answer would be simply yes, but that won't have much meaning until we provide some
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.440]   definitions and biblical content for the word legalism. Here's the startling fact that more
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.880]   people need to take into account and they need to become more careful in their use of the language.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.320]   There is no word for legalism in New Testament Greek. The English word legalism never occurs
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.440]   in any modern translation of all the Bible. It's not in ESV, NIV, NASB, New King James.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:02.400]   What this means is that the incredible frequency and confidence with which we use the word today
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:12.000]   in a negative way to criticize other people stands on very shaky ground. Not shaky because
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.960]   such a thing may not exist, but shaky because we may not know what we're talking about.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.920]   And if we do know what we're talking about, it may not be in the Bible, may not be a biblical idea,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.480]   but everybody just slings this word around, unbelievably common and with such amazing
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.040]   confidence. So we need to look at the scriptures and decide what the English word legalism
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.160]   might refer to in the Bible. So let's mention three or four things that are often called
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.480]   legalism, which the New Testament does not condemn, but in fact encourages. And I am using
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.520]   the word legalistic here to refer to something bad just because that's the way it's universally
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.880]   used. So number one, I think I have four of these. So these are things that are
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.640]   considered to be bad when people call them legalistic, but in the New Testament are good.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.960]   So number one, it is not legalistic to believe that a changed life of love and holiness
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.040]   are necessary for final salvation. Hebrews 12, 14, "Strive for the holiness without which
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.720]   no one will see the Lord." Ephesians 5, 5, "For you may be sure of this, everyone who is sexually
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.400]   immoral or impure or who is covetous," that is an idolatry, "has no inheritance in the kingdom of
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.840]   Christ and God." So the biblical truth is that Christ's blood and righteousness are the sole
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:08.160]   ground of our full acceptance into God's favor, but the new life of love and holiness, pursued
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   with all our might, ready to cut off our hands if we must, is necessary as the fruit which
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.560]   demonstrates that we are truly in Christ and born again. It is not legalistic to be that serious
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.840]   about holiness. Number two, it is not legalistic to think of the Christian life as a life of
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:39.520]   obedience guided by commands, commandments of Jesus. Those two words, obedience and commandments,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.280]   are not legalistic words in the New Testament. Philippians 2, 12, "Therefore, my beloved,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.560]   as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   work out your salvation with fear and trembling." Or 1 John 2, 3, "And by this we know that we have
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   come to know him if we keep his commandments." Number three, it is not legalistic for a Christian
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:24.080]   to make it his aim to please God by the way he lives. Justification by faith alone does not
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:33.120]   exclude this; it empowers it. 2 Corinthians 5, 9, "Whether we are at home or away," meaning in
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:44.560]   heaven or on earth, "we make it our aim to please the Lord." Number four, it is not legalistic to
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.840]   use warnings and threatenings toward professing Christians to stir them up to be vigilant in
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.640]   their pursuit of holiness in heaven. Colossians 3, 5, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.800]   in you—sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry—on
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.280]   account of these," he's addressing Christians, "the wrath of God is coming." So don't do them!
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.040]   And Matthew 5, 30, "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.160]   better for you, you disciples, Peter, James, John, it's better for you to lose one of your members
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.120]   than that your whole body go into hell." It's not wrong, it's not legalistic to use that kind of
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.560]   Jesus and apostolic language to warn professing Christians to get about the business of putting
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.520]   sin to death in their life. So then, what would be the meaning of legalism? If that's what it isn't,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.840]   and yet many consider to be is, what would it be? What would the New Testament really condemn
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   that we sometimes and should call legalistic? Here are three meanings of legalism that I hear
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.800]   used today that I think ought to be used, but they should be carefully explained, which ones being
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.440]   used and when. Number one, we might call someone legalistic if they are overly scrupulous about
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.040]   behaviors that are not prohibited or commanded in the New Testament. This is what Romans 14
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.760]   is mainly about. It goes like this, "Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:45.520]   and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats." So that despising and that
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:53.680]   judging would be legalistic on this definition. Number two, we might call someone legalistic
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:02.240]   if they fail to see that the mosaic system of sacrifices and priestly ceremonies and rights of
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.160]   purification and food laws and rituals that distinguish Israel from the nations are not
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   binding any longer on the Christian. Hebrews 8, 13, "In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:24.880]   first one obsolete," or Romans 7, 4—actually, just verse 6, maybe, both of them say almost the same
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:32.160]   thing—"We are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.000]   the way of the Spirit and not the old way of the written code." And finally, number three,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.520]   we might call someone legalistic if they treat the law or any moral behavior as the ground
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:56.480]   of our full acceptance with God instead of seeing Christ's blood and righteousness as the only
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:06.400]   ground of our acceptance and faith in Him as the only means of having what He died to obtain.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:16.560]   So Romans 8, 3, "God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do." What?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:24.400]   "By sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, He condemned sin." So our condemnation is
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.760]   over because He did in the cross what we could never do by law-keeping. Or Galatians 5, 2—this
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   is even clearer, I think—"If you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:57.280]   the whole law." Which means if you're going to use circumcision as part of the ground of your
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.160]   acceptance with God, you've got to go all the way and be a perfect person in law-keeping. So you
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.080]   just better get rid of that notion and bank everything on Jesus Christ for your acceptance
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:16.720]   with God. Now, my answer is yes, a person can be legalistic about legalism. Yes, you can.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.200]   And here's the easiest way to see it, I think, is what I see anyway in our day. Watch a person
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:31.360]   who thinks another Christian is being overly scrupulous about behaviors that are not
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.320]   prohibited or commanded in the New Testament. Perhaps praying at meals, having personal
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.480]   devotions every day, having family devotions in the evening, abstaining from alcohol,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.320]   refusing to watch movies with nudity, etc. None of those is mentioned in the New Testament.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:10:00.400]   And then you see this legalism-rejecting, so-called free person become overly scrupulous himself
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:09.600]   about doing the very behaviors that the overly scrupulous Christian avoided. You see him
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:19.440]   turn those very behaviors into necessities in order to show that he's not legalistic, he's free.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:27.040]   So he's just got to do those things that this other generation didn't do or not do what they
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.440]   did when in fact the freedom may be just as much a bondage to be different, a bondage to be
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.360]   different as the so-called legalism they are rejecting may be a bondage to tradition.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:51.040]   So yes, it is possible to be legalistic about legalism, but the big challenge, as I see it,
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:59.600]   is to know what we're talking about when we use the word legalism and that we measure it
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.400]   by the scriptures. Yeah, sobering. God save us from this. Thank you, Pastor John.
