[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 10. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.680]   This is the Daily Personal Finance Show, dedicated to serving you with accurate information,
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.160]   comprehensive education, and inspiration to help enhance your financial literacy so that
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.280]   you can save money, live better, and achieve the lifestyle of your dreams. No matter where
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.160]   you're coming from today, my goal is to deliver some ideas that will impact your life and
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.000]   help you to optimize your personal financial plan.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.880]   Today is August 5, 2013, and today we're going to talk about income. The theme of today's
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:57.040]   show is that you and I, we are both 100% responsible for our level of income. Now hear me out,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.960]   don't shut me off too quickly. Many people when they hear a statement like that immediately
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   will shut me off. But give me an opportunity to explain, give me an opportunity to defend
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.680]   that idea, and I hope by the end of it you will see some of where I'm coming from.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.840]   You know, in past shows we've been talking a lot about varied topics, which is how I
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   hope that this show goes. But one thing I think that's very important is that I do not
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   want this show to reflect a poverty consciousness in the wrong way, meaning that life is difficult,
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.560]   we have to scrimp and scrape and just barely get by simply because we can't afford to save
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.360]   any money, or we can't afford to make enough to actually save any money. Income is what
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.160]   drives everything in financial planning. So remember there's only three variables that
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.560]   we can really affect. Number one, how much you make. Number two, how much you spend.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.880]   Number three, what we do with the difference between those two things. That's it. Everything
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.360]   else is commentary as somebody famous says. How much you make, how much you spend, and
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.960]   what we do with the difference between those things. Now if what you make is low and what
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.920]   you spend is high, that's a problem. If what you make is high and what you spend is low,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   that helps. So we've got to constantly, consistently come back to that and focus on each of those
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.760]   things. What you make, what you spend, and what you do with the difference between those
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.160]   two numbers. So today we're going to talk about what you make. And I believe that the
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.120]   foundation to start with, with what you make is by taking 100% responsibility for what
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   you make. You know if you read books on psychology, personal development, things like that, one
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.400]   of the themes that you may find, at least that I have found, is that taking personal
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.880]   responsibility is one of the most important starting places for any major life improvement.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.160]   If one doesn't take personal responsibility for their life, it's very difficult to make
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.360]   any progress. This could be applied in a marriage. If you don't take 100% responsibility for
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.160]   your marriage, it's very possible that your marriage may suffer. This can be applied to
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.400]   your personal life. If you don't take responsibility for your health, if you don't take responsibility
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.760]   for your wealth, if you don't take responsibility for your ability as a parent, or for your
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.720]   function on your job, if you don't take responsibility for those things, then the results are not,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   the results are going to be subpar. Now, many people obviously when I say something
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   like take one, let's use marriage as an example. I believe that each person in a marriage should
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.640]   take 100% responsibility for the marriage. So in my marriage, I take 100% of the responsibility
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.280]   for my marriage. There's a bit of a cognitive, a bit of cognitive dissonance there. Because
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.780]   in a marriage you have two people involved, obviously not any one person of those two
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.760]   is 100% responsible. Some would say that there's a 50/50 responsibility. That's possible.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.080]   That makes sense if you have two people to split the responsibility. But what do you
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.480]   do when there's disagreement? What if one person is 70% right and the other person is
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:58.960]   30% right? It's impossible to work your way down that list and be able to rightly divide
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:07.160]   the responsibility. How much easier is it if I take 100% responsibility? Because the
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.960]   thinking here is that if I take 100% responsibility, that means that I never have to look at my
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.920]   spouse and say, "Well, it's her fault. She needs to do such and such. If only she would
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.840]   do this, then I would do that." The point is it's my responsibility. Now, I wouldn't
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.040]   say that responsibility and fault are the same thing. So I wouldn't say that it's
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.920]   100% my fault. I think that would be an inaccurate statement. But responsibility is an important
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.800]   thing. The example that's come to my mind in the past, and specifically I've thought
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.360]   of it when talking with my wife about our marriage, is the example of who has responsibility
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.880]   for closing a gate to keep animals in. Let's pretend for a moment you're on a farm or
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.800]   you have some, I guess you don't have to be on a farm, but just pretend you have a
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.960]   gate to keep your dog in, or your cat in, or whatever animals there is that you're
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.560]   dealing with. Imagine for a moment, and I'm going to continue using marriage as an example
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.400]   and then we'll move to finances. Imagine for a moment that you have a gate and in your
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.560]   marriage you're not quite sure who's responsible for closing the gate. So you say, "Well,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.240]   it's partly your responsibility." I'll use me. And I say, "Partly to my wife."
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.120]   You know, "Wife, it's partly responsible, you're partly responsible for closing the
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:40.400]   gate and I'm partly responsible for closing the gate." Well, if the gate's open, I
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.480]   may have the potential for looking at it and I may say, "Well, today's the day that
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   Tiffany's going to close the gate." That's my wife's name. "Today's the day that
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.200]   Tiffany's going to close the gate, so I'll leave it alone." And Tiffany may look at
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.600]   the gate and say, "Well, today's the day that Josh was going to close the gate."
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.400]   And the gate might not get closed. But, if I take 100% responsibility and I say, "It's
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   my responsibility. If I see the gate open, it's my job to go and shut the gate." Pure
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   and simple. Now, if my wife is a virtuous woman, and she is, she can also take 100%
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.040]   responsibility for the gate and say, "If I see the gate open, I'm going to go and
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   make a clip and I'm going to go and close it." That's what I mean by taking 100%
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.080]   responsibility. So when it comes to income, this is a very charged discussion. I wasn't
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.480]   sure exactly what I was going to talk about this morning, but I noticed on my Twitter
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.960]   feed last night, I was noticing a friend make a comment about the wages that a large fast
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.640]   food restaurant, McDonald's, pays its employees. And, in case you don't pay much attention
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.040]   to popular news and whatnot, McDonald's Corporation made quite a stir some weeks ago back in July,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.560]   I think it was early July, when they released some budgeting guidance for their employees.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.400]   And as part of that budgeting guidance, they released a sample budget for somebody who's
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.720]   working at their restaurants. And, I'll let you go and research the numbers. I don't
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.980]   want to talk about the numbers this morning, but many people were extremely upset at the
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:26.760]   low level of income and low level of expenses that McDonald's put on that budget. Extremely
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.080]   upset. And I was thinking, so my friend posted a note about the corporate profits that McDonald's
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   declared and talked about what they pay their employees. And I think that my personal opinion
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   is that a company will, can and should pay excellent wages and provide an excellent working
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.240]   environment for their employees out of their own selfish best interest. Because that will
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   help them to develop a more quality workforce that cares about their process and about their
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   product. However, no employee is required to work there. And I'm not going to get into
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.280]   a discussion and debate on the aspects of where to work and opportunity and whatnot.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:33.040]   I just want to talk about personal responsibility. Each and every one of us is responsible for
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.480]   what we make. It may be that we've come from an extremely privileged background, however
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:45.040]   you define privilege. Maybe our parents were wealthy. They were upper class or upper middle
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.680]   class. Perhaps they sent us to the best schools, provided the best tutors for us, gave us the
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.480]   best education, provided all of our needs. And because of that, we've been able to have
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:06.880]   a life of luxury because of it. And today our lives exude success in every area. Or
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:14.560]   perhaps we came from a very underprivileged start. Perhaps we were abused as children
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.640]   and we have deep, deep, deep emotional and psychological scars because of that. Perhaps
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.760]   we come from another country. Perhaps we're immigrants. Perhaps we are in a situation
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.800]   where we're just extremely disadvantaged. Perhaps our skills are lacking, our education
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   is lacking. Perhaps even our own physical and mental abilities are lacking. Perhaps
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.760]   we're not as capable as others may be.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   Now one note before I continue on. Today I'm going to speak in the context of the US-American
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.720]   context. I've been fortunate to travel a good bit in my life and I have seen other
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.800]   contexts and I'm simply not qualified to apply what I'm saying in other dynamics. I have
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.480]   been in places in the world and lived in places in the world where I woke up and shook my
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.080]   head and said it's a difficult place to be and it's very difficult for someone to get
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.400]   ahead. You need a miracle. And I think there are still things that can be done to optimize
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.760]   but when the entire social structure and the governmental structure is against you, it
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.520]   seems very challenging. And I am absolutely not qualified to talk about those countries.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.360]   So let's set that aside. It's a conversation for another day. I'd love to be of service
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.120]   to some people in those contexts but I don't know how to be. But I do feel that I can speak
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.280]   accurately about the US-American context. And in the US-American context, opportunity
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:01.720]   is wide open. It absolutely still is. People say well those times are changed. No they're
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.480]   not. It absolutely, we still do live in the land of opportunity. Now opportunity is a
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.440]   charged word because an opportunity is not a guarantee. An opportunity is just that,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:27.200]   it's an opportunity. People have an opportunity to do what they, whatever they can do. But
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.880]   it's not a guarantee. Now when it comes to income, you're responsible for how much
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:41.920]   money you make. I'm responsible for how much money I make. It doesn't mean that
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.720]   I can't make choices. I don't always choose personally. I don't always choose to do
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.920]   the things that result in the highest income because that doesn't reflect my values. But
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.000]   I will never say that I'm not responsible for how much money that I make. It's in
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:09.160]   my hands. It's largely under my control. See here's what I mean. In the United States
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:21.560]   of America, you are paid exactly based upon your worth in the marketplace. That's it.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.240]   Now that's a freeing concept for me. If I'm paid exactly according to my worth in
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.720]   the marketplace, then what I need to do is look and say, "Am I happy with what I'm
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.760]   making?" And if not, I just simply need to increase my worth or I need to make sure
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:47.800]   the marketplace really sees my worth. And if the marketplace is ignoring my current
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.600]   worth, I guarantee you somebody's going to find me from another opportunity who's
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   going to recognize that worth. It may not be immediate, but somebody's going to find
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:07.480]   it. The level of income that we make has much to do with our personal productivity, our
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.680]   personal performance, our personal skills, and our personal knowledge and our personal
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:19.240]   ability. So why do some people with the same 52 weeks a year, 24 hours a day, why do some
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:27.560]   people make $10,000 a year, some people make $100,000 a year, some people make a million
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:34.920]   dollars a year, some people make a $10 million a year, and some people make far more? What's
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:40.760]   the difference? Well, it's obviously not a difference in time, although it may be a difference
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:47.520]   in hours worked. It's a difference in the person's knowledge, skills, ability, and the
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:55.440]   environment in which they're applying those things. We all have the same amount of time.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   We all start from where we start from, and that's mostly irrelevant. We all come out
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:10.520]   naked, kicking and screaming as people say. We all start with no education. Now some people
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.840]   start that education process early. We all start with no character. Some people start
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   that character formation process early. But each and every one of us has the opportunity
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:30.240]   to increase who we are, to change who we are, and to become more valuable in the marketplace.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.040]   But if we only do that if we see that we are responsible. If we don't see that we're responsible
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.720]   for how much money we make, we view it as someone else's fault. "Well, I'm not making
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.600]   enough because my employer's not paying me enough." Or, "I'm not making enough because
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   my hourly wage is not enough, and the minimum wage is too low." Or, "I'm not making enough
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:56.520]   because my company doesn't allow me to advance beyond this certain cap, this salary cap."
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.940]   Or, "I'm not making enough because the commission rate is too low, or because the commission
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.720]   rate is decreased." Or, "I'm not making enough because business is bad, and customers aren't
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:11.960]   buying my products." You're responsible for affecting those things. You're responsible
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:17.880]   for changing those things. I'm going to give some examples, but the two things that I want
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:24.400]   to focus on is that by taking responsibility we can take action. And number two, that by
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   developing our own knowledge, skills, and ability we can become worth more in the marketplace.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.120]   Number one, in taking action there's a lot of actions we can take. Most of them probably
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:45.120]   aren't going to be fun in the short term. Taking responsibility I have found is very
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.320]   rarely fun because it forces me to look at my own character and my own shortcomings.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   I usually don't enjoy that because my character and my shortcomings are usually weaker than
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.320]   I wish they were. But it's important. So if I'm not making enough, let's go with the lower
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   wage of the wage scale. If I'm not making enough, what's my first choice? Work more.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.160]   I'm not saying that everybody should work 100 hours a week, but there's a reality to
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.720]   it that if I'm not making enough, I've got to work more. I've been to places in the world
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.840]   one year ago was a place that really impacted me. I was in Guatemala City, Guatemala. And
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.360]   in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and in many places in the world, they have a large city
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:41.880]   dump. And there are people that make their living in the dump. Their entire living and
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.760]   their entire livelihood comes from scavenging through the trash, finding things that might
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:53.800]   be of value to other people, collecting those things, and reselling them. And that made
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.280]   my heart hurt for those people who were living there. Children, men, women. It absolutely
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.000]   still does make my heart hurt for the people that are living there. And I want to help.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   So this is not coming from any kind of arrogant idea that there's something wrong with the
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.640]   people there. There's nothing wrong with people there. Some of the hardest working, most dedicated
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   people that I have seen. But imagine you're in that situation. If your entire living comes
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:29.280]   in such a basic, challenging way, do you hang out all morning? Lying in your bed, enjoying
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.680]   the bed, and then get up in the afternoon? You know, you wouldn't want to work during
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.040]   the hot part of the day. So you get up in the afternoon for a little bit, work a little
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.280]   bit in the coolness of the evening, find what you need, and then turn around and go and
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:50.360]   sell it? Guarantee you not. The people that I observed and that I interacted with, sun
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:58.880]   up to sun down every single day. Work is something like that. If you're not making enough, you've
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.640]   got to work more. Got to work more, got to work harder. The people that were making their
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.280]   living in that manner were not lazy. Think about many of us who, obviously, if you're
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:17.960]   listening to the sound of my voice, you have access to maybe a computer, maybe an mp3 player,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.920]   maybe a phone that you're streaming me on. Think about the situation that we have in
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:32.080]   life. Think about the opportunities that we have. So number one is we can work more, we
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.440]   can work harder. The interesting thing about the McDonald's budget that was published,
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.080]   many people were incensed that McDonald's assumed automatically that people would have
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.800]   a set of two jobs. It lists right on the budget income from first job and income from second
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.600]   job. People were incensed about that. Now again, I'm not going to get into the political
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.920]   conversation here, but are you kidding me that you would work on minimum wage and only
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:10.920]   have one job? Are you kidding me that you'd work on minimum wage and work 30, 35, 40 hours
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:19.800]   a week? There's no possibility of that. It's not possible to make it on that, which is
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.280]   why people that work those types of jobs, generally it's part of a family unit or generally
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.000]   they're young, young people. Young people just getting started, working part time as
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.320]   they're working their way through school. It's not an adult that is working and supporting
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:45.880]   their family as running the cash register up front. Now I will tell you this, my observation
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.460]   and experience with people who work at McDonald's, McDonald's has some of the best advancement
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:57.080]   opportunities in the world. If you are dedicated and focused, McDonald's will take you from
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.920]   being on the front cash register. If you've got a good smile, a good sense of humor, and
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.240]   by the way those are easy to develop, McDonald's will take you from there and they will put
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.840]   you through McDonald's University and they will take you to be a top level manager. And
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.680]   there are plenty of people who have started on the front line at minimum wage who now
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:23.640]   own multiple McDonald's. And McDonald's franchises are very profitable to own. That's up to you.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:31.200]   Do you come to work with a surly face or do you come to work with a smile? It's a choice.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.320]   Responsible, you're responsible for that choice. The second big thing that impacts our income
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:45.640]   is our knowledge, skills, ability, personal productivity. Now years ago I heard a talk
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:51.840]   by Brian Tracy. I always have enjoyed Brian Tracy's presentations. When I was younger
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.800]   I bought all of his books and audio programs and I would strongly encourage you if you're
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.000]   looking for a good place to start, it's tough to do a lot better than what he has to share.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.600]   Brian Tracy is, I don't know what you call him, I wouldn't call him a motivational speaker.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.560]   That has a different connotation. He often goes by management consultant and personal
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.880]   success coach. I don't know what he is. He's a speaker, he's a writer, but he comes from
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.120]   a corporate background. But I have always found every book, every recording, everything
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:28.640]   that I've ever purchased from him to be incredibly pithy and to be packed with information. So
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.120]   there's my, I give you a ringing endorsement that every dollar you may spend on any of
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:42.560]   his materials would be well worth the money spent. So I really couldn't recommend anybody
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:49.080]   more highly than I recommend Brian Tracy's materials. The thing that I always love and
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:59.600]   have, enjoy and appreciate about his talks is that he doesn't leave you with fluffy,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:11.800]   feel good ideas and emotions. He gives you practical tips and strategies and tools that
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   you can use to take action on what he says and then that action ultimately produces the
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:28.120]   good emotional feelings. Years ago I heard a talk from him called his thousand percent
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:33.320]   formula, how to increase your income by a thousand percent in ten years time. And I
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.760]   will link to his original, I found one version of his talk on YouTube. I will link to that
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.240]   talk in the show notes so that you can watch him do it. I am 100% plagiarizing what he
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.360]   has said, just adding a few things of my own and I'll summarize his points. But his major
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:58.160]   thought was that, he proposed that anybody can increase their income by a thousand percent
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:06.520]   in ten years time. So take your current income, multiply it by ten. So if you're earning
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.240]   fifty thousand dollars a year, that's five hundred thousand dollars a year. If you're
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.880]   earning twenty thousand dollars a year, that's two hundred thousand dollars a year. If you're
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   earning a hundred thousand dollars a year, that's a million and etc. And the reason he
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.560]   said that was partly A) because he had experienced it. His story that he tells in the video that
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.280]   I'll link to was that one year he finished his tax return and his taxable income was
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:39.400]   fourteen thousand four hundred dollars. Twelve years later he filed his tax return and his
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   taxable income was one million four hundred and forty thousand dollars. An increase of
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.880]   one thousand percent over the course of twelve years. And it was in looking back and reflecting
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.760]   on that and reflecting on what he had done in the interim that he developed his thousand
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.520]   percent formula. But the major idea is that you can increase your income by increasing
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   your productivity, your performance and your output. In the United States of America and
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.720]   in many countries in the world, you're paid exactly what you're worth. I'm not getting
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.520]   into your worth as a human being, but as a person, as an individual, as a sovereign individual.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.360]   But in your economic worth, you're paid exactly what you're worth. So if you want to get paid
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:37.080]   more, the only thing you can do is be worth more. To develop your skills, knowledge, ability,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:44.720]   increase your productivity, your performance and your output. That's it, that's the formula.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.000]   And it's applied at every end of the income scale. So if you're making eight dollars an
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.680]   hour and you say I want to make nine dollars an hour, you have to look at your situation
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:00.840]   and say what does someone who is worth nine dollars an hour do and how do I become that
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.040]   person? And if you're making three hundred thousand dollars a year and you want to make
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.600]   eight hundred thousand dollars a year, you have to look at your situation and say what
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.880]   does somebody who is worth eight hundred thousand dollars a year do in the marketplace and how
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.160]   do I become that person? And it's going to be different than who you are making three
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:33.120]   hundred thousand dollars a year. It's going to be an evolution, an evolution of yourself.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.920]   Brian Tracy's formula that he delivered in that talk that I heard years ago, is that
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.280]   if you'll focus on yourself and develop your own personal abilities, you'll become worth
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:53.760]   more in the marketplace. And all you have to do is focus on small, incremental, consistent
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:02.560]   changes. Incremental, consistent changes. And if you do that, you can become worth more
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.360]   in the marketplace. Now his formula, let me walk through his formula of how he got to
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.320]   one thousand and four percent, one thousand percent over the course of ten years. What
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:25.280]   he said was, can you become one tenth of one percent more productive each and every day?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.800]   If you'll just focus on each and every day becoming one tenth of one percent better,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.240]   better at what you do, more productive, higher performance, increasing your output, increasing
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:41.360]   your skills. One tenth of one percent better every single day. That'll get you where you
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.760]   need to go. I'll walk through the math in just a second. Let me ask you a question and
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.480]   think about this. And by the way, when I share these things, I'm not coming from a place
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.920]   of I haven't done it. I haven't made one million four hundred and forty thousand dollars in
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:28:00.800]   a year yet. But, I'm doing this with you, but I believe that the concept is sound. Could
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:10.120]   you become one tenth of one percent better every day? I think anybody could get one tenth
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:16.680]   of one percent better every day. It's one one thousandth better every day. A tiny little
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.960]   improvement. And he gives a formula for how to do that. I'm going to add a few of my own
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.980]   things to that. But the math is that if you'll become one tenth of one percent better each
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:34.720]   and every day, that means that each and every week you'll become one half of one percent
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.800]   better every week. One tenth times five, five days a week is one half of one percent. Which
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:50.200]   means that every four weeks, every month, you will become two percent better than what
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:57.840]   you are right now. Two percent better every single month, or every single four week period.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.960]   There are thirteen four week periods in a year, fifty two weeks a year. Two percent
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.200]   better every four week period over the course of one year is twenty six percent better.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.160]   Twenty six percent better each year, compounded over ten years is one thousand and four percent
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:26.400]   better every ten years. So you get ten times better in ten years. That's the math. But
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.000]   it comes down to one tenth of one percent better every day. Now, the formula for how
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.560]   to do this is pretty simple. He lists seven things in his formula, which I'll share with
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:42.440]   you. And then I'm going to add a few of my own as we go through. And I'm not going
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.880]   to worry too much about what's attributed to him and what's attributed to me. You
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   can watch the video, the YouTube video, and you'll see what's attributed to him. But
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:59.000]   here's the important thing. Take somebody who earns ten thousand dollars per year,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.680]   and take somebody who earns a hundred thousand. That's probably a bad example. Take someone
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.480]   who earns forty thousand dollars a year and someone who earns four hundred thousand dollars
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.520]   a year and ask, does the person who works, who is earning four hundred thousand dollars
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:20.000]   a year work ten times as hard as the person who's making forty thousand dollars a year?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.720]   I would say no. It's probably not possible to work ten times as hard. Does the person
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.080]   who's making four hundred thousand dollars an hour, excuse me, four hundred thousand
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.840]   dollars a year work ten times more hours than the person who's working, making forty thousand
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.960]   dollars a year? There's no way. It's not possible. So what's the difference? The person
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.320]   who's making four hundred thousand a year has a higher level of knowledge, skills, and
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.800]   ability and they're applying those things in a different field or in a different manner
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:31:02.840]   than the person making forty. So that means that in order to make more, we have to develop
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:08.440]   who we are as a person and increase our knowledge, skills, and ability as a person. Now to prove
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.800]   this to yourself, ask yourself this question. Look at your industry. Wherever you come in
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.440]   the pay scale of your industry, look at your industry and ask yourself, is the person at
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.560]   the very top of your industry is making ten times more than you are? The answer is probably
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:31.280]   likely yes. That somebody who's at the very top of your industry is probably making ten
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.080]   times more than you are. Unless you're at the top of your industry. In which case you've
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.720]   got a choice of, am I in the right industry where I'm happy with what I'm doing? Or do
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.680]   I need to change? Or you have the choice of, is this important to me to make more? And
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.240]   if so, can I either figure out a way to do it in my current industry or do I need to
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:32:01.320]   switch to another industry? Side note, make sure that as you're doing these things that
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.960]   first you've got your ladder leaning against the right tree. You're going to talk about
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.800]   what to do. It's a lot easier if you know you're in the right career. And this may change
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.400]   over time, but it's a lot easier to know what to do if you're confident in the career and
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:26.440]   the choices that you have made. So step one of Brian Tracy's formula is get up earlier
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:36.000]   and read for one hour every single day. Read one hour every single day in your field. Now
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.600]   the average American simply does not read. If you only did this one thing, if you only
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   got up an hour earlier and read for one hour per day, how many books would you read and
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.680]   how much knowledge would you acquire and how many skills could you pick up as time goes
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:05.760]   by? The impact that step alone could have is astounding. If you read at the average
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:11.440]   rate of speed that the average American reads, you would read on average an hour a day about
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:20.320]   a book a week. If you read about a book a week, that's about 50 books a year, which
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.560]   means in the course of 10 years you would read 500 books. And these should be books
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.520]   that are either in your field or are something that you think would benefit you and help
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.280]   you. So the question is this, look at your industry and ask yourself, if I were to read
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:49.200]   500 books that were in my field, is it possible that I wouldn't have a comprehensive knowledge
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.800]   of what's going on in my industry? Is it possible that there would be anybody else
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.360]   that were more knowledgeable than me? It may be possible but it's not probable. Most people
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:06.600]   don't read. Just that right there, one hour per day, that's 50 books a year, that's
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:15.520]   500 books in your field. That could increase your knowledge by 1000% easily. His step two
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.040]   is make a list of everything you need to do every day before you start. Make a list of
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.240]   everything you need to do every day before you start. Write it down. Most people don't
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:33.480]   write things down. Step three, put it in order of priority. Most people don't put this in
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.800]   order of priority. This is my personal weakness. I can put it in order of priority but I usually
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.880]   want to work on the fun things before the most important things. So put that list in
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:56.120]   order of priority and then start on the most important thing and focus on it 100%. Step
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.520]   five, turn your car into a university on wheels. The average person in the United States of
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.040]   America spends about the same amount of time in their car as the average college student
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:15.640]   spends in class. Which means that if you'll seek out information and education that are
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:22.720]   on topics that are interesting and important to you and you'll do that while you're listening
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:29.000]   in your car, you'll gain far ahead even things like this podcast. Here's my commitment and
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.800]   my promise to you. I promise that in the fullness of time by listening to this show, listeners
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:42.160]   to this show will develop a level of understanding and financial literacy that goes from the
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:52.440]   basics to as high as enough knowledge that would be required for passing the CFP board
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:36:00.000]   exam which is a comprehensive financial planning exam that's administered by the CFP. Now it's
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.080]   going to take a little time to get there. I don't have 97 classes on financial planning
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.720]   scoped out in my mind. I'm figuring this out as I go. But I promise that we're going to
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.760]   talk about the basics from what is compound interest and what is an asset and what is
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.480]   a liability all the way through advanced complex technical topics. My challenge is just to
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.360]   figure out how to do that in an interesting way that's not boring. I don't know how to
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.560]   do that so I'm working on that. But you can listen to this for free in your car. My goal
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.680]   is to deliver the equivalent of a college education in financial planning through this
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.600]   podcast. So that right there, just simply turning a drive time into a learning time
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:50.000]   could be incredibly valuable. So many people have benefited from that. For me personally,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.040]   this has been a huge asset through the years. I don't have much of a commute now because
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   I've arranged my life in such a way to diminish my commute. But for years I commuted. And
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:05.440]   any time my car was moving, I always was listening to something, learning something, understanding
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:14.160]   something and developing my knowledge on something. Brian Tracy's step number six is ask two questions
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.640]   every day after every major meeting or after every major day. Number one is what did I
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:27.760]   do right? Number two is what would I do differently next time? I think of this as self-coaching.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.640]   By asking yourself what did I do right and what would I do differently if I were doing
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:42.920]   this again next time? This is a valuable skill to be able to coach yourself into everything
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.520]   that you need. See, teachers and coaches, they don't know your situation, but you do.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.840]   And you can coach yourself if you'll observe. But most people don't take the time to observe
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   and analyze. So observe. What did I do right and what would I do differently next time?
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:04.080]   His step seven is treat everyone you meet like a million dollar customer or a VIP. Treat
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:13.680]   everyone you meet as important. Now think about the impact of those steps that he gives.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:20.680]   Reading an hour a day in your field. You're building your knowledge. Make a list of everything
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.320]   you need to do. Put it in order by priority. Start on the most important thing and focus
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.040]   single-mindedly on that. You're increasing your productivity. Turn your car into a university
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.960]   on wheels. You're increasing your knowledge. Ask two questions. You're increasing your
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.680]   skills and your ability and you're coaching yourself in the right direction. Treat everyone
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.740]   you meet like a million dollar customer or the most valuable person. You're increasing
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:53.920]   your social skills. Is there anything that's not enhanced by that? Is it possible that
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.800]   if you got one-tenth of one percent better at each one of those things each and every
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:09.000]   day that you would be able to make some major progress? I think it's very likely. And the
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.200]   difference between the major progress can be substantial. The difference between somebody
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.240]   who's doing those things and not doing those things at the beginning doesn't seem like
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:24.120]   much. Someone who is two percent better in the beginning, not that big a deal. But at
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:31.560]   the end of a year, someone who's 26 percent better, that's huge. At the end of two years,
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:37.400]   someone who is 40, 50 percent better, I guess it wouldn't quite be that. I can't compound
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:49.120]   the numbers in my head but it would be huge. Time and compounding make a huge difference.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.240]   I'm going to add a couple of things. This is actually probably also from one of Brian
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.560]   Tracy's books that I read back in the past. I'm going to focus specifically on the education
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:06.960]   part of things. Education is so important. Without education, education is important.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.640]   And he has two steps that he mentioned in these seven steps that I wrote down from the
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.720]   video. But in the book, I remember him adding a third. So step one, read for an hour a day
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:21.400]   in your field. That's a book a week, that's 50 books a year. Average PhD program requires
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.320]   a student to read between 30 and 50 books and write a dissertation. If you read for
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:33.640]   an hour a day, 50 books a year in your field, that's the equivalent of a PhD level education
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:41.240]   each and every year. Number two, listen to educational materials in your car. That's
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.200]   the equivalent if you spend the same amount of time in your car as the average college
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.560]   student spends in class. That's the equivalent of two and a half bachelor's degrees over
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.440]   a ten year period of time. Let's call it two and round down to be conservative. His step
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:01.760]   three is search out, seek out, and attend one conference in your field every quarter,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.040]   or per year. And the reason that conferences are important is because conferences in your
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.280]   field, or conventions, or shows, or whatever it is in your field, is where the best of
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:19.300]   the best and the brightest of the brightest are invited to share their ideas. They don't
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:25.360]   invite the people who are losing up on stage, generally. They invite the people who are
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.400]   crushing it. And one idea at a conference can make the entire thing worth it. The other
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.960]   thing that's so valuable about conferences is that the people who go to conferences are
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.720]   the people who are generally very committed and very dedicated to their fields of study
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:46.320]   and fields of work. So by being at the conferences and networking with the people that are there,
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:52.800]   you're in a situation where you're getting to know the best of the best, and you're becoming
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:42:00.200]   friendly with them, and you are learning their tips and their techniques just simply by being
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.560]   there. Now it takes time out to take time off on the weekends. That's why the people
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   that you find at the conference are the highest earners in your field. Now I add another one.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.120]   Learn to be a decent public speaker. If you're not comfortable with public speaking, join
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.080]   Toastmasters organization. Well worth the, I don't know, tiny little membership fees
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.720]   to learn how to be a decent public speaker. Because the thing is this, while you're at
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:33.360]   a conference, you want to network with the leaders who are there, who are leading the
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.760]   sessions and the ideas. And is there any reason why if you're reading 50 books a year in your
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.920]   industry, and you're getting two bachelor's degrees every 10 years in your industry, and
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.360]   you're applying those insights each and every day, and you're learning while you're at the
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.320]   conferences, is there any reason why you shouldn't be on stage? Why you shouldn't be sharing
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:43:01.160]   the things that are helpful for you? There's no reason at all. And with those things being
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:08.040]   done, is there any reason why you shouldn't be able to increase your income by 1000%?
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:15.920]   But this only starts if you start with taking personal responsibility for your life. You
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.320]   have to take personal responsibility for your life, for your education, for your knowledge.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.960]   I personally get really upset when people talk about, "Oh, I can't do this because I
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:32.200]   can't go to college." Education is free. Each and every town has a local library. And in
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:40.320]   that library are hundreds and thousands of books that are available for free to you.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   All for the cost of driving there or walking there or riding a bicycle there and going
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.760]   inside and learning. Whether someone is a brand new immigrant to the United States,
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.920]   and I believe this formula can be solved in any way. Immigrants to the United States,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:02.600]   by the way, I think the statistic that I can't source this or prove this, but the number
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.200]   that I remember in my mind, four times more likely to become millionaires than natural
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.160]   born citizens. People who show up to the United States don't speak a word of English. You
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.640]   can get English classes for free down at your local library. You can check out English classes
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.280]   on CD. The books are there for free. The internet is there for free. With YouTube, there is
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:28.200]   almost nothing you can't learn with YouTube. Want to learn math skills? Khan Academy. Want
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.920]   to learn science skills? There's tons of science podcasts. You can watch university lectures
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.760]   for free. Everything for free. The problem is not that the information and the education
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.560]   is not available. The problem is that people don't seek it out. So don't be one of those
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.560]   people. Seek it out. Seek it out. To close, take responsibility for your income. Choose
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:45:01.840]   how much money you want to make. If you want to make a low level of income, maybe to avoid
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:08.480]   paying income taxes, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. There are people,
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.520]   I'm fascinated by people who are tax protesters. I'm hoping to have one on the show here. I
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.280]   have contacted for an interview. It's not quite the right time, but in the future I'm
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:23.960]   going to interview somebody who is a tax protester. This person is anti-war and he does not want
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:30.220]   his tax dollars being used to support foreign wars. And so because of that, he avoids paying
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:35.840]   income taxes. He avoided paying income taxes by consciously reducing his income from a
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.760]   higher taxable income down to a level that's no longer taxable. So if you want to choose
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:49.120]   to make a lower income, more power to you. But you can also choose to make a higher income
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.080]   or develop your skills and knowledge and ability that you have the opportunity to do that.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:59.120]   Take responsibility for that and encourage others to take responsibility for that. I
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.280]   hope this has been a good show. I felt a little bit like I've rambled, so if I have, forgive
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   me. It's always challenging to be pointed and brief, but yet share enough information.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.400]   I hope some of the ideas in here, these ideas have been helpful to me. Look at the show
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.360]   notes for more information. There are others that are much more capable of explaining things
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.200]   better than I can. So look in the show notes for some other resources and links. I hope
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.040]   this has been helpful. Leave some feedback in the comments section. Shoot me an email
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.920]   at joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com or also leave some notes in the comments section.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:38.760]   If you have questions, let me know what your questions are. I want to tailor this show
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.800]   to be exactly what will serve you, the audience. We're starting to get some really nice numbers
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.360]   as far as listenership. I'm excited. I'm committed to being here and doing this. I'm going to
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.920]   be improving my audio quality soon here. I apologize, the website was down last week
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   for a day or two. I host the website with Bluehost and evidently there were some major
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:08.160]   outages with the parent company that owns Bluehost and HostGator. There were something
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.280]   like 8 million websites affected. So poor folks over there were scrambling all day to
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.680]   get things done. So the site was down on Friday. But it should be back up now. Again, going
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.040]   to keep on doing this, getting better. Let me know what you want, how I can serve you.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   I'm going to keep applying my 1000% formula to this show. Doing it consistently, learning
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.120]   how to become better at it. If you need to check back in 10 years, check back in 10 years
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.000]   and find out if I'm 1000% better. I believe I will be. So just check back and we'll find
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.960]   out for it. We'll find out together. Have a great week everybody.
