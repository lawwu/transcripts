[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 10.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   This is the daily personal finance show dedicated to serving you with accurate information,
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:23.220]   comprehensive education, and inspiration to help enhance your financial literacy so that
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.460]   you can save money, live better, and achieve the lifestyle of your dreams.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.000]   No matter where you're coming from today, my goal is to deliver some ideas that will
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   impact your life and help you to optimize your personal financial plan.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.920]   Today is August 5, 2013, and today we're going to talk about income.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.480]   The theme of today's show is that you and I, we are both 100% responsible for our level
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.980]   of income.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.920]   Now hear me out.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   Hear me out.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.440]   Don't you dare.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.780]   Don't shut me off too quickly.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.600]   Many people, when they hear a statement like that, immediately will shut me off.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100]   But give me an opportunity to explain.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.240]   Give me an opportunity to defend that idea, and I hope by the end of it, you will see
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.580]   some of where I'm coming from.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:27.180]   In past shows, we've been talking a lot about varied topics, which is how I hope that this
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.800]   show goes.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.760]   But one thing I think that's very important is that I do not want this show to reflect
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.380]   a poverty consciousness in the wrong way, meaning that life is difficult.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.760]   We have to scrimp and scrape and just barely get by simply because we can't afford to save
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.800]   any money, or we can't afford to make enough to actually save any money.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.340]   Income is what drives everything in.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.800]   In financial planning.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.140]   So remember, there's only three variables that we can really affect.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.240]   Number one, how much you make.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   Number two, how much you spend.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.900]   Number three, what we do with the difference between those two things.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.320]   That's it.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.920]   Everything else is commentary, as somebody famous says.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.580]   How much you make, how much you spend, and what we do with the difference between those
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.920]   things.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.300]   Now, if what you make is low and what you spend is high, that's a problem.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.340]   If what you make is high and what you spend is low, that helps.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.500]   So we've got to constantly, consistently come back to that and focus on each of those things.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.340]   What you make, what you spend, and what you do with the difference between those two numbers.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.560]   So today we're going to talk about what you make.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.100]   And I believe that the foundation to start with, with what you make, is by taking 100%
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.620]   responsibility for what you make.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.280]   You know, if you read the book, you'll find that it's not just about what you make.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.180]   If you read books on psychology, personal development, things like that, one of the
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.080]   themes that you may find, at least that I have found, is that taking personal responsibility
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.860]   is one of the most important starting places for any major life improvement.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.260]   If one doesn't take personal responsibility for their life, it's very difficult to make
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.820]   any progress.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.820]   This could be applied in...
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.700]   in a marriage.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.300]   If you don't take 100% responsibility for your marriage, it's very possible that your
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.200]   marriage may suffer.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.240]   This can be applied to your personal life.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.620]   If you don't take responsibility for your health, if you don't take responsibility for
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:51.640]   your wealth, if you don't take responsibility for your ability as a parent, or for your
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.800]   function on your job, if you don't take responsibility for your health, if you don't take responsibility
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.600]   for those things, then the results are not...
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.900]   the results are going to be subpar.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.840]   Now, many people, obviously, when I say something like, take one...
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.140]   let's use marriage as an example.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.860]   I believe that each person in a marriage should take 100% responsibility for the marriage.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.320]   So, in my marriage, I take 100% of the responsibility for my marriage.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   There's a bit of a...
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.780]   There's a bit of a...
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.360]   There's a bit of cognitive dissonance there.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.200]   Because in a marriage, you have two people involved.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.980]   Obviously, not any one person of those two is 100% responsible.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.540]   Some would say that there's a 50-50 responsibility.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.920]   That's possible.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.280]   That makes sense.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.080]   If you have two people, split the responsibility.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   But what do you do when there's disagreement?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.220]   What if one person is 70% right and the other person is 30% right?
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.760]   It's impossible to work your way down that list and...
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.840]   and be able to rightly divide the responsibility.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.960]   How much easier is it if I take 100% responsibility?
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.740]   Because the reason...
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.780]   The thinking here is that if I take 100% responsibility,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.160]   that means that I never have to look at my spouse and say,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.920]   well, it's her fault.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   She needs to do such and such.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.480]   If only she would do this, then I would do that.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.420]   The point is, it's my responsibility.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.940]   Now, I wouldn't say that responsibility and fault are the same thing.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.620]   So I wouldn't say that it's 100% my fault.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.860]   I think that would be an inaccurate statement.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.240]   But responsibility is an important, important thing.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.280]   The example that's come to my mind in the past,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.020]   and specifically I've thought of it when talking with my wife about our marriage,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.900]   is the example of who has responsibility for closing a gate to keep animals in.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.400]   Let's pretend.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.640]   Pretend for a moment you're on a farm or you have some...
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.960]   I guess you don't have to be on a farm.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.860]   Just pretend you have a gate to keep your dog in
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.620]   or your cat in or whatever animals there is that you're dealing with.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.900]   Imagine for a moment,
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.520]   and I'm going to continue using marriage as an example,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.660]   then we'll move to finances.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.200]   Imagine for a moment that you have a gate
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.820]   and in your marriage,
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.480]   you're not quite sure who's responsible for closing the gate.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.020]   So you say, well, it's partly your responsibility.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.920]   I'll use me.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.260]   And I say, part to my wife.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.660]   You know, wife, it's partly responsible.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.340]   You're partly responsible for closing the gate
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.340]   and I'm partly responsible for closing the gate.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.160]   Well, if the gate's open,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.680]   I may have the potential for looking at it
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.940]   and I may say, well,
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.580]   today's the day that Tiffany's going to close the gate.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.360]   That's my wife's name.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.600]   Today's the day that Tiffany's going to close the gate,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.400]   so I'll leave it alone.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.800]   And Tiffany may look at the gate and say,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.360]   well, today's the day that Tiffany's going to close the gate.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.560]   Today's the day that Josh was going to close the gate
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.840]   and the gate might not get closed.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.800]   But if I take 100% responsibility
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.040]   and I say it's my responsibility,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.760]   if I see the gate open,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.360]   it's my job to go and shut the gate.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   Pure and simple.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.780]   Now, if my wife is a virtuous woman,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.500]   and she is,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.080]   she can also take 100% responsibility for the gate
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.040]   and say, if I see the gate open,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.340]   I'm going to go and make a close
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.540]   it.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.740]   That's what I mean by taking 100% responsibility.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.880]   So when it comes to income,
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.720]   this is a very charged discussion.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.700]   I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to talk about this morning,
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.220]   but I noticed on my Twitter feed last night,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.920]   I was noticing a friend make a comment
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.380]   about the wages that a large fast food restaurant,
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.500]   McDonald's, pays its employees.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.620]   And in case you don't pay much attention to popular news
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.620]   and whatnot,
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.320]   McDonald's pays its employees.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.020]   McDonald's Corporation made quite a stir some weeks ago
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.320]   back in July,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.660]   I think it was early July,
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.540]   when they released some budgeting guidance
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.520]   for their employees.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.040]   And as part of that budgeting guidance,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.260]   they released a sample budget
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.520]   for somebody who's working at their restaurants.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.480]   And I'll let you go and research the numbers.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.080]   I don't want to talk about the numbers this morning,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.480]   but many people were extremely upset
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.040]   at the low level of income
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.920]   and low level of expenses
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.380]   that McDonald's put on that budget.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.000]   Extremely upset.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.900]   And I was thinking,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.760]   so my friend posted a note
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.140]   about the corporate profits
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.520]   that McDonald's declared
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.460]   and talked about what they pay their employees.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.140]   And I think that my personal opinion
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.100]   is that a company
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.240]   will, can and should,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.100]   pay excellent wages
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.680]   and provide an excellent working environment
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.600]   for their employees
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.280]   out of their own self-interest.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.380]   Best interest.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.560]   Because that will help them to develop,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.480]   that will help them to develop
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.300]   a more quality workforce
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.600]   that cares about their process
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.700]   and about their product.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.700]   However,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.160]   no employee is required to work there.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.540]   And I'm not going to get into a,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.960]   I'm not going to get into a discussion
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.880]   and a debate on those,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.040]   on the aspects of where to work
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.260]   and opportunity and what not.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.300]   And I just want to talk about personal responsibility.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.020]   Each and every one of us
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.680]   is responsible for what we make.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.140]   It may be that we've come from
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.060]   an extremely privileged background,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.580]   however you define privilege.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.320]   Maybe our parents were wealthy.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.420]   They were upper class
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.480]   or upper middle class.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.960]   Perhaps they sent us to the best schools,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.860]   provided the best tutors for us,
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.620]   gave us the best education,
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.940]   provided all of our needs
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.240]   and became the best teacher
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.820]   and because of that,
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.940]   we've been able to have a life of luxury
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.440]   because of it.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.200]   And today,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.900]   our lives exude success in every area.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:11.420]   Or perhaps we came from a very underprivileged start.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.480]   Perhaps we were abused as children
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   and we have deep, deep, deep emotional
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.720]   and psychological scars because of that.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.840]   Perhaps we come from another country.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.760]   Perhaps we're immigrants.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.240]   Perhaps we are in a situation where
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   we're just extremely disadvantaged.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.940]   Perhaps our skills are lacking.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.340]   Our education is lacking.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.500]   Perhaps even our own physical
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.080]   and mental abilities are lacking.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.460]   Perhaps we're not as capable
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.960]   as others may be.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.940]   Now, one note
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.520]   before I continue on today,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.140]   I'm going to speak in the context
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.500]   of the U.S. American context.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.720]   I've been fortunate to travel a good bit in my life
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.580]   and I have seen other contexts.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.060]   And I'm simply not qualified to apply what I'm saying
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.040]   in other dynamics.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   I have been in places in the world and lived in places
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   in the world where I woke up and shook my head and said,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.460]   "It's a difficult place to be and it's very difficult
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.400]   for someone to get ahead.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.040]   You need a miracle."
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.480]   And I think there are still things that can be done
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.620]   to optimize, but when the entire social structure
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.620]   and the governmental structure is against you,
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.160]   it seems very challenging.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.440]   And I am absolutely not qualified
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.680]   to talk about those countries.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.840]   So let's set that aside.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.620]   It's a conversation for another day.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.880]   I'd love to be of service to some people in those contexts,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.820]   but I don't know how to be.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.620]   But I do feel that I can speak accurately
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.240]   about the U.S. American context.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.200]   And in the U.S. American context, opportunity is --
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.460]   I think it's a very important word.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.740]   It's a very important word.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.100]   It's a very important word.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.220]   And I think that's why I'm saying
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.700]   that opportunity is wide open.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.900]   It absolutely still is.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.460]   People say, "Well, those times have changed."
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.100]   No, they're not.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.460]   It absolutely -- we still do live in the land of opportunity.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.640]   Now, opportunity is a charged word
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.460]   because an opportunity is not a guarantee.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.500]   An opportunity is just that.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.500]   It's an opportunity.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.440]   People have an opportunity to do what they --
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.320]   whatever they can do.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.120]   But it's not a guarantee.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   Now, when it comes to income,
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.560]   you're responsible for how much money you make.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.760]   I'm responsible for how much money I make.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.000]   It doesn't mean that I can't make choices.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.640]   I don't always choose personally.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.560]   I don't always choose to do the things that result
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.100]   in the highest income because that doesn't reflect my values.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.420]   But I will never say that I'm not responsible for how much money I make.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.880]   It's in my hands.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.580]   It's largely under my control.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.020]   See, here's what I mean.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:15.460]   In the United States of America, you are paid exactly based upon your worth in the marketplace.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.460]   That's it.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.400]   Now, that's a freeing concept for me.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.820]   If I'm paid exactly according to my worth in the marketplace,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:34.400]   then what I need to do is look and say, "Am I happy with what I'm making?"
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.900]   And if not, I just simply need to increase my worth
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:45.480]   or I need to make sure that the marketplace really sees my worth.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.160]   And if the marketplace is ignoring my current worth,
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.380]   I guarantee you somebody's going to find me from another opportunity.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.620]   I guarantee you somebody's going to recognize that worth.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:02.500]   It may not be immediate, but somebody's going to find it.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.000]   The level of income that we make has much to do with our personal productivity,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.140]   our personal performance, our personal skills, and our personal knowledge,
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.980]   and our personal ability.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.760]   So why do some people with the same 52 weeks a year, 24 hours a day,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.260]   why do some people make $10,000 a year?
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.360]   Some people make $100,000 a year.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.860]   Some people make $100,000 a year.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.620]   Some people make $1 million a year.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.440]   Some people make $10 million a year.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.760]   And some people make far more.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.460]   What's the difference?
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.800]   Well, it's obviously not a difference in time,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.560]   although it may be a difference in hours worked.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.320]   It's a difference in the person's knowledge, skills, ability,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.520]   and the environment in which they're applying those things.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.340]   We all have the same amount of time.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:59.840]   We all start from where we start from, and that's mostly irrelevant.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   We all come out naked, kicking and screaming, as people say.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.960]   We all start with no education.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.740]   Now some people start that education process early.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.340]   We all start with no character.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.700]   Some people start that character formation process early.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.320]   But each and every one of us has the opportunity.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   We all have the opportunity to increase who we are,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.020]   to change who we are, and to become more valuable in the marketplace.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.140]   But we only do that if we see that we are responsible.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.140]   If we don't see that we're responsible for how much money we make,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.940]   we view it as someone else's fault.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.680]   Well, I'm not making enough because my employer's not paying me enough.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.240]   Or I'm not making enough because my hourly wage is not enough,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.080]   and the minimum wage is too low.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.300]   Or I'm not making enough because my company doesn't allow me to advance beyond
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.580]   this certain cap, this salary cap.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.080]   Or I'm not making enough because the commission rate is too low,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.880]   or because the commission rate is decreased.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.700]   Or I'm not making enough because business is bad,
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.120]   and customers aren't buying my products.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.420]   You're responsible for affecting those things.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.260]   You're responsible for changing those things.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.500]   I'm going to give some examples, but the two things that I want to focus on is that
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.280]   by taking responsibility, we can take action.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.820]   Number two, that by developing our own knowledge, skills, and ability,
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.500]   we can become worth more in the marketplace.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.340]   Number one, in taking action, there's a lot of actions we can take.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:43.320]   Most of them probably aren't going to be fun in the short term.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.980]   Taking responsibility, I have found, is very rarely fun because it forces me to look at
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.560]   my own character and my own shortcomings.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.260]   I usually don't enjoy that.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.080]   My character and my shortcomings are usually weaker than I wish they were.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.820]   But it's important.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:06.340]   So if I'm not making enough, let's go with the lower wage of the wage scale.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.440]   If I'm not making enough, what's my first choice?
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   Work more.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.020]   Now I'm not saying that everybody should work 100 hours a week, but there's a reality
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   to it.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.700]   That if I'm not making enough, I've got to work more.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.240]   You know, I've been to places in the world.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.120]   Years ago was a place that really impacted me.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.700]   I was in Guatemala City, Guatemala.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.480]   And in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and in many places in the world, they have a large city
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.760]   dump.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.940]   And there are people that make their living in the dump.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.820]   Their entire living and their entire livelihood comes from scavenging through the trash, finding
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:53.220]   things that might be of value to other people, collecting those things, and reselling them.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.700]   And now it made my heart hurt for those people who were living there.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.780]   Children, men, women.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.740]   It absolutely still does make my heart hurt for the people that are living there.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.040]   And I want to help.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.580]   So this is not coming from any kind of arrogant idea that there's something wrong with the
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.580]   people there.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   There's nothing wrong with people there.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.620]   Some of the hardest working, most dedicated people that I have seen.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.140]   But imagine you're in that situation.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.200]   If your entire living comes in such a basic, challenging way.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.880]   Do you hang out all morning?
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.860]   Lying in your bed, enjoying the bed, and then get up in the afternoon?
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.620]   You wouldn't want to work during the hot part of the day.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.920]   So you get up in the afternoon for a little bit, work a little bit in the coolness of
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.780]   the evening, find what you need, and then turn around and go and sell it?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.680]   Guarantee you not.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:53.180]   The people that I observed and that I interacted with sun up to sun down every single day.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.300]   Work is something like that.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.940]   If you're not making enough, you've got to work more.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.420]   You've got to work more.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   You've got to work harder.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.300]   The people that were making their living in that manner were not lazy.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.740]   Think about many of us who obviously, if you're listening to the sound of my voice, you have
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:22.200]   access to maybe a computer, maybe an MP3 player, maybe a phone that you're streaming me on.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.160]   Think about the situation.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.440]   Think about the opportunities that we have in life.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.500]   Think about the opportunities that we have.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.080]   So number one is we can work more.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.120]   We can work harder.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.840]   The interesting thing about the McDonald's budget that was published, many people were
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.160]   incensed that McDonald's assumed automatically that people would have a set two jobs.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.820]   It lists right on the budget income from first job and income from second job.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.140]   People were incensed about that.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:59.900]   Now, again, I'm not going to get into the political conversation here, but are you kidding
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.640]   me that you would work on minimum wage and only have one job?
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.980]   Are you kidding me that you'd work on minimum wage and earn and work 30, 35, 40 hours a
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.020]   week?
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.580]   There's no possibility of that.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:21.620]   It's not possible to make it on that, which is why people that work those types of jobs,
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.120]   generally it's part of a family unit.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.420]   or generally their young people.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.640]   Young people just getting started,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.400]   working part-time as they're working their way through school.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:38.880]   It's not an adult that is working and supporting their family
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.500]   as running the cash register up front.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.480]   Now I will tell you this, my observation and experience
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.880]   with people who work at McDonald's,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.720]   McDonald's has some of the best advancement opportunities in the world.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.700]   If you are dedicated and focused,
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.460]   McDonald's will take you from being on the front cash register,
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.460]   if you've got a good smile, a good sense of humor,
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.240]   and by the way, those are easy to develop,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.780]   McDonald's will take you from there,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.760]   and they will put you through McDonald's University,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.660]   and they will take you to be a top-level manager.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.800]   And there are plenty of people who have started on the front line
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.200]   at minimum wage who now own multiple McDonald's.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.980]   And McDonald's franchises are very profitable to own.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.320]   That's up to you.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.920]   Do you come to work with a surly face?
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   Or do you come to work with a smile?
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.580]   It's a choice.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.100]   You're responsible.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.800]   You're responsible for that choice.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.280]   The second big thing that impacts our income
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.300]   is our knowledge, skills, ability, personal productivity.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:46.540]   Now, years ago, I heard a talk by Brian Tracy.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.580]   I always have enjoyed Brian Tracy's presentations.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.400]   When I was younger,
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.380]   I bought all of his books and audio programs,
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.040]   and I would strongly encourage you,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.220]   if you're looking for a good place to start,
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.860]   it's tough to do a lot better than what he has to share.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.820]   Brian Tracy is, I don't know what you call him,
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.080]   I wouldn't call him a motivational speaker.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.720]   That has a different connotation.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.780]   He often goes by management consultant
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.360]   and personal success coach,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.900]   and I don't know what he is.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.020]   He's a speaker, he's a writer,
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.800]   but he comes from a corporate background.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.500]   But I have always found every book,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.440]   every recording,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.540]   every book,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.480]   everything that I've ever purchased from him
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.340]   to be incredibly pithy
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.860]   and to be packed with information.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.960]   So there's my,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.020]   I give you a ringing endorsement
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.820]   that every dollar you may spend on any of his materials
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.220]   would be well worth the money spent.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   So I really couldn't recommend anybody more highly
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.900]   than I recommend Brian Tracy's materials.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.100]   The thing that I always love and enjoy and appreciate
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.420]   is that he's a great person.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.220]   And I think that's what I've been doing
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.180]   about his talks,
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.320]   is that he doesn't leave you
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:03.060]   with fluffy, feel-good ideas and emotions.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.060]   He gives you practical tips and strategies and tools
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:15.520]   that you can use to take action on what he says.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.260]   And then that action ultimately produces
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.220]   the good emotional feelings.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.020]   And I think that's what I've been doing
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.060]   for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.120]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.200]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.240]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.280]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.320]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.360]   And I think that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.120]   Years ago, I heard a talk from him
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.020]   called,
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.440]   it's a thousand percent formula,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.660]   how to increase your income by a thousand percent
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.720]   in ten years' time.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.860]   And I will link to his original,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.940]   I found one version of his talk on YouTube.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.700]   I will link to that talk in the show notes
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.000]   so that you can watch him do it.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.660]   I am 100% plagiarizing what he has said,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.180]   just adding a few things of my own,
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.940]   and I'll summarize his points.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.200]   But his major thought was that,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.300]   he proposed that anybody
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.100]   can increase their income by a thousand percent
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.140]   in ten years' time.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.540]   So take your current income,
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.860]   multiply it by ten.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.480]   So if you're earning $50,000 a year,
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.420]   that's $500,000 a year.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.520]   If you're earning $20,000 a year,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.140]   that's $200,000 a year.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.600]   If you're earning $100,000 a year,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.880]   that's a million, and etc.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.580]   And the reason he said that
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.480]   was partly, A, because
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.740]   he had experienced it.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.100]   His story that he tells in the video that I'll link to
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.820]   was that one year he finished his tax return
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.320]   and his taxable income was
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.540]   $14,400.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.700]   Twelve years later,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.460]   he filed his tax,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.760]   and his taxable income was
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.840]   $1,440,000.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.260]   An increase of 1,000%
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.000]   over the course of 12 years.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.120]   And it was in looking back
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.480]   and reflecting on that,
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.020]   and reflecting on what he had done in the interim,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.480]   that he developed his thousand percent formula.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.560]   But the major idea is that
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.940]   you can increase your income
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.160]   by increasing your productivity,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.940]   your performance,
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.120]   and your output.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.740]   In the United States of America,
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.500]   and in many countries in the world,
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.320]   you're paid exactly what you're worth.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.120]   I'm not getting into your worth
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   as a human being,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.880]   but as a person,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.780]   as an individual, as a sovereign individual.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.740]   But in your economic worth,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.720]   you're paid exactly what you're worth.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.580]   So if you want to get paid more,
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.640]   the only thing you can do
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.480]   is be worth more.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.100]   To develop your skills,
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.060]   knowledge, ability,
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.820]   increase your productivity,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.300]   your performance,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.560]   and your output.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.060]   That's it.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.780]   That's the formula.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.140]   And it's applied at every end of the income scale.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.320]   So if you're making $8 an hour,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:50.940]   and you say,
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.240]   I want to make $9 an hour,
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.600]   you have to look at your situation
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.000]   and say,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.480]   what does someone who is worth $9 an hour do,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.260]   and how do I become that person?
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.460]   And if you're making $300,000 a year,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.460]   and you want to make $800,000,
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.920]   you have to look at your situation and say,
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.780]   what does somebody who is worth $800,000 a year do
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.480]   in the marketplace,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.960]   and how do I become that person?
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.620]   And it's going to be different
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.140]   than who you are making $300,000 a year.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.280]   It's going to be an evolution.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.480]   An evolution of yourself.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:34.240]   Brian Tracy's formula
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.240]   that he delivered in that talk,
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.640]   that I heard years ago,
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.120]   said if you'll focus on yourself
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.160]   and develop your own personal abilities,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.140]   you'll become worth more in the marketplace.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.220]   And all you have to do
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:56.000]   is focus on small, incremental, consistent changes.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.380]   Incremental, consistent changes.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.460]   And if you do that,
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.220]   you can become worth more in the marketplace.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.340]   Now his formula,
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.120]   let me walk through,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.800]   his formula of how he got to 1,000%
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.980]   over a course of 10 years.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.920]   What he said was,
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.280]   can you become one-tenth of one percent
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.740]   more productive
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.340]   each and every day?
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.860]   If you'll just focus on each and every day
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.320]   becoming one-tenth of one percent better,
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.560]   better at what you do,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.300]   more productive,
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.940]   higher performance,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.640]   increasing your output,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   increasing your skills,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.100]   one-tenth of one percent better every single day.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.720]   That'll get you where you need to go.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.180]   And I'll walk through the math in just a second.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.500]   Let me ask you a question and think about this.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.680]   And by the way,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.500]   when I share these things,
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.760]   I'm not coming from a place of,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.600]   I haven't done,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.740]   I haven't made $1,440,000 in a year yet.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.080]   But,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.340]   I'm doing this with you,
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.900]   but I believe that the concept is sound.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.680]   Could you become one-tenth of one percent better
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.500]   every day?
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.200]   I think anybody could get one-tenth of one percent better
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.000]   every day.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.980]   It's one-one-thousandth better every day.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.180]   A tiny little improvement.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.800]   And he gives a formula for how to do that.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.700]   And I'm going to add a few of my own things to that.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:26.580]   But the math is that if you'll become one-tenth of one percent better
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.680]   each and every day,
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.060]   that means that each and every week,
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.080]   you'll become one-half of one percent better
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:35.480]   every day.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.120]   Every week.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.660]   One-tenth times five,
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.740]   five days a week is one-half of one percent.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.480]   Which means that every four weeks,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.080]   every month,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.260]   you will become
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.600]   two percent better
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.000]   than what you are right now.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.340]   Two percent better
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.160]   every single month
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.660]   or every single four-week period.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.780]   There are 13 four-week periods in a year,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.800]   52 weeks a year.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.160]   Two percent better every four-week period
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.280]   over the course of one year
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.420]   is 26 percent better.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.660]   26 percent better each year,
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.420]   compounded over 10 years,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.660]   is 1,004 percent better
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.040]   every 10 years.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   So you get 10 times better in 10 years.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   That's the math.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   But it comes down to one-tenth of one percent better every day.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.080]   Now, the formula for how to do this is pretty simple.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.200]   He lists seven things in his formula,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.840]   which I'll share with you.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.900]   And then I'm going to add a few of my own, though,
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.960]   as we go through.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.600]   And I'm not going to worry too much about
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.040]   what's attributed to him
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.900]   and what's attributed to me.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.720]   You can watch the video,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.620]   the YouTube video,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.200]   and you'll see what's attributed to him.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.980]   But here's the important thing.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.460]   Take somebody who earns
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.000]   $10,000 per year.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.660]   Take somebody who earns $100,000.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.860]   That's probably a bad example.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.220]   Take someone who earns $40,000 a year
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.180]   and someone who earns,
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.800]   $400,000 a year.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.080]   And ask,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.740]   does the person who works,
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.880]   who is earning $400,000 a year
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.680]   work 10 times as hard
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.140]   as the person who's making $40,000 a year?
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.720]   I would say no.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.660]   It's probably not possible to work 10 times as hard.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.620]   Does the person who's making $400,000 an hour,
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.420]   excuse me,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.680]   $400,000 a year,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.100]   work 10 times more hours
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.960]   than the person who's working 10 times a year?
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.300]   And the person who's making $40,000 a year?
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:37.980]   There's no way.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.760]   It's not possible.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.260]   So what's the difference?
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.980]   The person who's making $400,000 a year
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.720]   has a higher level of knowledge, skills, and ability.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   And they're applying those things
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.840]   in a different field
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   or in a different manner
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.880]   than the person making $40,000.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.480]   So that means that in order to make more,
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.080]   we have to develop who we are as a person
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.880]   and increase our ability to make more.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.680]   And that's our knowledge, skills, and ability as a person.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.120]   Now to prove this to yourself,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.540]   ask yourself this question.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.500]   Look at your industry.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.140]   Wherever you come in the pay scale of your industry,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.720]   look at your industry and ask yourself
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.880]   that the person at the very top of your industry
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.760]   is making 10 times more than you are.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.000]   The answer is probably likely yes.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.140]   That somebody who's at the very top of your industry
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.420]   is probably making 10 times more than you are.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.660]   Unless you're at the top of your industry.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.000]   In which case, you've got a choice of
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.640]   am I in the right industry
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.960]   where I'm happy with what I'm doing?
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.420]   Or do I need to change?
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.440]   Or you have the choice of
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.940]   is this important to me to make more?
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.520]   And if so, can I either figure out a way
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.900]   to do it in my current industry
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.540]   or do I need to switch to another industry?
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:01.120]   Side note, make sure that as you're doing these things
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.400]   that first you've got your ladder
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.640]   leaning against the right tree.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.580]   You're going to talk about the tree.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:04.640]   You're going to talk about the tree.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.480]   You're going to talk about what to do.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.160]   It's a lot easier if you know you're in the right career.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.300]   And this may change over time,
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.780]   but it's a lot easier to know what to do
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.160]   if you're confident in the career
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.480]   and the choices that you have made.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:23.960]   So step one of Brian Tracy's formula
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.520]   is get up earlier
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.840]   and read for one hour every single day.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.540]   Read one hour every single day in your field.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.300]   Now the average American simply does not read.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.500]   If you only did this one thing,
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.760]   if you only got up an hour earlier
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.220]   and read for one hour per day,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.340]   how many books would you read
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.000]   and how much knowledge would you acquire
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.640]   and how many skills could you pick up
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.060]   as time goes by?
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:03.200]   The impact that step alone could have is astounding.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.340]   If you read at the average rate of speed
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.860]   that the average American reads,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.100]   you would read on average an hour a day
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   about a book a week.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.040]   If you read about a book a week,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.700]   that's about 50 books a year.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:22.460]   Which means in the course of 10 years,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.200]   you would read 500 books.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.080]   And these should be books that are either in your field
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.200]   or are something that you think would benefit you
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.760]   and help you.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.660]   So the question is this.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.140]   Look at your industry and ask yourself,
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.520]   if I were to read 500 books
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.020]   that were in my field,
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:43.280]   is it possible that
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.680]   is it possible that
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.160]   I wouldn't have a comprehensive knowledge
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.640]   of what's going on in my industry?
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.880]   Is it possible that there would be anybody else
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.440]   that were more knowledgeable than me?
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.740]   It may be possible, but it's not probable.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.900]   Most people don't read.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.420]   Just that right there, one hour per day,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.820]   it's 50 books a year.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.480]   That's 500.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.000]   That's 100 books in your field.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.900]   That could increase your knowledge by 1,000% easily.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:17.600]   His step two is make a list of everything you need to do
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.880]   every day before you start.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.060]   Make a list of everything you need to do
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.560]   every day before you start.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.060]   Write it down.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.520]   Most people don't write things down.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.900]   Step three, put it in order of priority.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.180]   Most people don't put lists in order of priority.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.460]   This is my favorite.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.260]   This is my personal weakness.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.180]   I can put it in order of priority,
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.000]   but I usually want to work on the fun things
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.420]   before the most important things.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.400]   Put that list in order of priority
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.860]   and then start on the most important thing
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.460]   and focus on it 100%.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:58.600]   Step five, turn your car into a university on wheels.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.880]   The average person in the United States of America
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.440]   spends about the same amount of time in their car
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.880]   as the average college student spends in class,
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.920]   which means that if you'll seek out information
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.140]   and education that are on topics
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.100]   that are interesting and important to you,
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.400]   and you'll do that while you're listening in your car,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   you'll gain far ahead, even things like this podcast.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.680]   Here's my commitment and my promise to you.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.800]   I promise that in the fullness of time,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.600]   by listening to this show,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.580]   listeners to this show will develop
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.620]   a level of understanding and financial literacy
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.740]   that goes from the basics
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.660]   to as high as enough knowledge
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.780]   that would be required for passing the CFP board exam,
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.900]   which is a comprehensive financial planning exam
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.700]   that's administered by the
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.780]   Certified Financial Planning Organization.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.780]   Now, it's going to take a little time to get there.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.180]   I don't have 97 classes on,
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.240]   on financial planning scoped out in my mind.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.800]   I'm figuring this out as I go.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.700]   But I promise that we're going to talk about the basics
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.420]   from what is compound interest and what is an asset
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.340]   and what is a liability,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.220]   all the way through advanced, complex, technical topics.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.340]   My challenge is just to figure out how to do that
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.500]   in an interesting way that's not boring.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.760]   And I don't know how to do that.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.780]   So I'm working on that.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.960]   But you can listen to this for free in your car.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.360]   And my goal is to deliver,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.100]   the equivalent of a college education and financial planning
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.280]   through this podcast.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.740]   So that right there,
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.520]   just simply turning a drive time into learning time
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.000]   could be incredibly valuable.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   So many people have benefited from that.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.840]   For me personally,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.740]   this has been a huge asset through the years.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.280]   I don't have much of a commute now
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.440]   because I've arranged my life in such a way
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.620]   to kind of diminish my commute.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.780]   But for years I commuted.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.160]   And anytime my car was moving,
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.300]   I always was listening to something,
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.240]   learning something.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.600]   I'm always listening to something.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.660]   And I'm always trying to get the job done.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.740]   And I'm always trying to get the job done.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.740]   And I'm always trying to get the job done.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:10.840]   And I'm always trying to get the job done.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:10.960]   And I'm always trying to get the job done.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.660]   Brian Tracy's step number six is ask two questions every day
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.440]   after every major meeting or after every major day.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.240]   Number one is, what did I do right?
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.160]   Number two is, what would I do differently next time?
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.800]   I think of this as self-coaching.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.500]   By asking yourself, what did I do right?
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.000]   And what would I do differently
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.640]   if I were doing this again next time?
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.860]   This is a valuable skill
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.520]   to be able to coach yourself
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.520]   into everything that you need.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.080]   See, teachers and coaches,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.480]   they don't know your situation.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.720]   But you do.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.980]   And you can coach yourself if you'll observe.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.280]   But most people don't take the time
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   to observe and analyze.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.860]   So observe.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.720]   What did I do right?
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.260]   And what would I do differently next time?
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.760]   His step seven is,
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.600]   treat everyone you meet
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.820]   like a million dollar customer or a VIP.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   Treat everyone you meet as important.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:12.080]   Now think about the impact of those steps that he gives.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.380]   Reading an hour a day in your field.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.060]   You're building your knowledge.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.300]   Make a list of everything you need to do.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.580]   Put it in order by priority.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.920]   Start on the most important thing
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.480]   and focus single-mindedly on that.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.560]   You're increasing your productivity.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   Turn your car into a university on wheels.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.700]   You're increasing your knowledge.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.580]   Ask two questions.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.180]   You're increasing your skills and your ability.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.300]   And you're coaching yourself in the right direction.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.240]   Treat everyone you meet like a million dollar customer
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.080]   or the most valuable person.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.520]   You're increasing your social skills.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.640]   Is there anything that's not enhanced by that?
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:56.200]   Is it possible that if you got one-tenth of one percent better
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.080]   at each one of those things each and every day,
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.180]   that you would be able to make some major progress?
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.000]   I think it's very likely.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.940]   And the difference between the major progress can be substantial.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.140]   And the difference between somebody who's doing those things
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.120]   and not doing those things,
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.680]   at the beginning doesn't seem like much.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   Someone who is two percent better in the beginning,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.780]   not that big a deal.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.980]   But at the end of a year, someone who's 26 percent better,
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.820]   that's huge.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.140]   The end of two years, someone who is 40,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.240]   50 percent better.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.580]   I guess it wouldn't quite be that.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.360]   I can't compound the numbers in my head.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.300]   But it would be huge.
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:46.520]   Time and compounding make a huge difference.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   Now I'm going to add a couple things.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.780]   And this is actually probably also from, I think,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.060]   one of Brian Tracy's books that I read back in the past.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.160]   But I'm going to focus specifically on the education part of things.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.800]   Education is so important.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.500]   Without education,
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.160]   education is important.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.820]   And he has two steps that he mentioned in these seven steps
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.920]   that I wrote down from the video.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.720]   But in the book, I remember him adding a third.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.320]   So step one, read for an hour a day in your field.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.740]   That's a book a week.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.940]   That's 50 books a year.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.780]   Average PhD program requires a student to read between 30 and 50 books
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.580]   and write a dissertation.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.680]   If you read for an hour a day, 50 books a year in your field,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   that's the equivalent of a PhD level education
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.480]   each and every year.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.360]   Number two, listen to educational materials in your car.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.660]   That's the equivalent.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.240]   If you spend the same amount of time in your car
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.200]   as the average college student spends in class,
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.740]   that's the equivalent of two and a half bachelor's degrees
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.540]   over a 10-year period of time.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.360]   Let's call it two and round down to be conservative.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.360]   His step three is search out, seek out,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.320]   and attend one conference in your field every quarter,
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.260]   four per year.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.720]   And the reason that conferences are important
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.500]   is because conferences in your field,
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.120]   or conventions, or shows, or whatever it is in your field,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.620]   is where the best of the best and the brightest of the brightest
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.880]   are invited to share their ideas.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:23.680]   They don't invite the people who are losing up on stage, generally.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.940]   They invite the people who are crushing it.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.060]   And one idea at a conference can make the entire thing worth it.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.980]   The other thing that's so valuable about conferences
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.680]   is that the people who go to conferences
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.780]   are the people who are generally very committed
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.640]   and very dedicated to their fields of study and fields of work.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.700]   So by being at the conferences
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.460]   and networking with the people that are there,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.680]   you're in a situation where you're getting to know the best of the best,
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.720]   and you're becoming friendly with them,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.320]   and you are learning their tips and their techniques
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.500]   just simply by being there.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.200]   Now, it takes time out.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.940]   It takes time off.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.580]   It takes time off on the weekends.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.480]   That's why the people that you find at the conference
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.540]   are the highest earners in your field.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.700]   Now, I add another one.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.340]   Learn to be a decent public speaker.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.380]   If you're not comfortable with public speaking,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.440]   join Toastmasters organization.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.140]   Well worth the, I don't know, tiny little membership fees
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.780]   to learn how to be a decent public speaker.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.380]   Because the thing is this.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.380]   While you're at a conference,
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.560]   you want to network with the leaders who are there
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.900]   who are leading the conversation.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.620]   Who are leading the sessions and the ideas.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.900]   And is there any reason why
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.220]   if you're reading 50 books a year in your industry,
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.300]   and you're getting two bachelor's degrees
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.940]   every 10 years in your industry,
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.180]   and you're applying those insights each and every day,
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.820]   and you're learning while you're at the conferences,
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.060]   is there any reason why you shouldn't be on stage?
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.420]   Why you shouldn't be sharing the things that are helpful for you?
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.060]   There's no reason at all.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.440]   And with those things being done,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.880]   is there any reason why you shouldn't be?
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.920]   Are you able to increase your income by a thousand percent?
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   But this only starts if you start
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.880]   with taking personal responsibility for your life.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:17.980]   You have to take personal responsibility for your life,
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.760]   for your education, for your knowledge.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.920]   I personally get really upset when people talk about,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.560]   oh, I can't do this because I can't go to college.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.700]   Education is free.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.160]   Each and every town has a local library.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.840]   And in that library,
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.920]   there are hundreds and thousands of books
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.340]   that are available for free to you.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:44.100]   All for the cost of driving there,
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.940]   or walking there,
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.000]   or riding a bicycle there,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.120]   and going inside and learning.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.740]   Whether someone is a brand new immigrant to the United States,
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.240]   and I believe this formula can be solved in any way.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.320]   Immigrants to the United States, by the way,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.720]   I think the statistic that I can't source this or prove this,
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.820]   but the number that I,
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.040]   I remember in my mind,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.300]   four times more likely to become millionaires
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.920]   than natural born citizens.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.940]   People who show up to the United States
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.060]   don't speak a word of English.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.420]   You can get English classes for free
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.520]   down at your local library.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.120]   You can check out English classes on CD.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.960]   The books are there for free.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   The internet's there for free.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.500]   With YouTube,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.200]   there is almost nothing you can't learn with YouTube.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.760]   Want to learn math skills?
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.680]   Khan Academy.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.180]   Want to learn science skills?
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.100]   There's tons of science podcasts.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.800]   You can watch YouTube videos,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.500]   university lectures for free.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.820]   Everything for free.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.900]   The problem is not that the information
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.420]   and the education is not available.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.640]   The problem is that people don't seek it out.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.840]   So don't be one of those people.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.680]   Seek it out.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.500]   Seek it out.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.600]   To close,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.520]   take responsibility for your income.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.040]   Choose how much money you want to make.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.280]   If you want to make a low level of income,
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.780]   you know, maybe to avoid paying income,
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:03.480]   income taxes.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.700]   That's fine.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.000]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.360]   There are people,
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.600]   I'm fascinated by people who are tax protesters.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.540]   I'm hoping to have one on the show here.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:15.580]   I've contacted for an interview.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.640]   It's not quite the right time,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.200]   but in the future,
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.960]   I'm going to interview somebody who is a tax protester.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.160]   This person is anti-war
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.020]   and he does not want his tax dollars being used
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.260]   to support foreign wars.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.840]   And so because of that,
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.080]   he avoids paying income taxes.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.760]   He avoided paying income taxes.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.580]   He avoided paying income taxes by consciously reducing his income
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.180]   from a higher taxable income
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.840]   down to a level that's no longer taxable.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.700]   So if you want to choose to make a lower income,
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.840]   more power to you.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.720]   But you can also choose to pay a higher income
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.140]   or develop your skills and knowledge and ability
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.920]   that you have the opportunity to do that.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.120]   Take responsibility for that
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.440]   and encourage others to take responsibility for that.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.960]   I hope this has been a good show.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.600]   It felt a little bit like I've rambled.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.620]   So if I have,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.420]   forgive me.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.180]   It's always challenging to be pointed and brief,
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.640]   but yet share enough information.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.260]   But I hope some of the ideas in here,
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.160]   these are ideas that have been helpful to me.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.800]   Look at the show notes for more information.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.260]   There are others that are much more capable
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.680]   of explaining things better than I can.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.880]   So look in the show notes for some other resources and links.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.860]   And I hope this has been helpful.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.460]   Leave some feedback in the comments section.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.080]   Shoot me an email,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.620]   joshua at radicalpersonalfinance.com
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.720]   or also leave some comments.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.920]   I'll put some notes in the comments section.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.560]   If you have questions,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.760]   let me know what your questions are.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.900]   I want to tailor this show
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.580]   to be exactly what will serve you, the audience.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.780]   We're starting to get some really nice numbers
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.820]   as far as listenership.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.420]   I'm excited.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.020]   I'm committed to being here and doing this.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.340]   Going to be improving my audio quality soon here.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.240]   I apologize.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.280]   The website was down last week for a day or two.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.480]   I host the website with Bluehost.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.700]   And evidently there were some major outages
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.640]   with the parent company that owns Bluehost and HostGator.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.700]   And there were something like 8 million websites affected.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.200]   So poor folks over there were scrambling all day
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.980]   to get things done.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.320]   So the site was down on Friday.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.140]   But it should be back up now.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.800]   And again, going to keep on doing this, getting better.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.020]   Let me know what you want, how I can serve you.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.240]   I'm going to keep applying my 1000% formula to this show.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.760]   Doing it consistently,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.800]   learning how to become better at it.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.060]   If you need to check back in 10 years,
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:32.680]   check back in 10 years.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.880]   And find out if I'm 1000% better.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.720]   I believe I will be.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.680]   So just check back and we'll find out together.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.020]   Have a great week everybody.
