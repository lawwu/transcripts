[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua, and today
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:50.880]   on the show, I want to talk to you about when something that is completely innocuous, completely
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:02.000]   harmless was banned in an ostensibly free western country. And what's more is I want
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.580]   to talk to you with proven history when not only was this banned, but it was banned for
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.920]   very clearly ulterior motives. It was banned by the government so that the government could
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:30.720]   steal from its own citizens. What was banned? Gold coins. Gold bullion. Did you know that
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.360]   for just over 40 years in the United States, from about 1933 to 1974, it was illegal for
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:49.640]   you to own something as simple and innocuous as a gold coin? Did you know that you could
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   not own gold bullion, legally speaking, in the United States for that four decade period?
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.520]   And if you did own it, your assets, your gold coins, your gold bullion, or your gold certificates
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.200]   could be, and in some cases were, seized and kept by the US government. If you didn't
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   know it, don't be too hard on yourself. I remember distinctly that I was quite literally
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.640]   a financial planner, literally a certified financial planner. And one day I think somebody
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.480]   said to me and made a claim that it was illegal to own gold coins as short of a time ago as
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.040]   50 years ago in the United States. And I said, "Illegal to own a gold coin? Come on, that's
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   ridiculous." And I started doing my research and I found out that they were right. Today
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.760]   I want to share with you the history of Executive Order 6102. And there are a couple of other
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   follow on pieces of legislation, but this is usually talked about as Executive Order
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.640]   6102, which will go over for you the truth of what I have just stated. We're going to
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.040]   go over the history. I'm going to explain to you what happened because I think in today's
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.120]   world it's important for you and me to understand that what has happened before can and perhaps
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.400]   will happen again. As I record this on Tuesday, March 1, 2022, there are several very current
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.880]   cases of governments using financial laws in ways that might make us uncomfortable.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.960]   We've talked recently about the government of Canada authorizing Canadian banks, brokerage
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.760]   companies, insurance companies, and other financial institutions to unilaterally freeze
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.120]   the assets of anybody suspected of having been involved with the Freedom Convoy protest.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.980]   This was done under so-called Emergency Measures Act, which never did wind up getting voted
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:05.080]   on fully by both houses of the Canadian Parliament. And I showed how this is a very worrying example
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.920]   of modern financial debanking, de-financialization, which is a trend that I'm very concerned about.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   And what was worse is that particular system was being done with no judicial oversight,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.480]   and the institutions were guaranteed immunity from any kind of civil liability that they
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.300]   might incur from the actions of freezing or confiscating the assets of people suspected
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.560]   to be involved with the protests. Now, I don't think that particular event was the end of
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   the world as we know it, but I thought it was a good example of what can happen. In
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.900]   addition, another very current example that we see happening right now is we see governments
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.820]   all around the world, very notably governments in Western Europe and the United States and
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.160]   many other countries as well, seeking to freeze the assets of Russians, both specifically
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.420]   the Russian government, Russian government officials, the so-called Russian oligarchs,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:16.460]   as well as just ordinary, common, everyday Russians getting bundled up with it. Now,
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.020]   these are some examples that sometimes you look at, and ethically, it's harder to figure
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.140]   out what's going on. For example, very few people are shedding tears when the news comes
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.180]   along that Vladimir Putin or the Russian oligarchs have had their assets frozen. Currently, that's
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.300]   not a big concern for many people from an ethical perspective. They say, "Listen, if
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.420]   you're going to go and invade your neighbor, we're going to take your money and we're going
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.340]   to freeze it and shut it all down." I think it's not as simple as that. I think there
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.620]   are more important ethical considerations in terms of making Russians themselves suffer.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.180]   I get very concerned about any action that's going to affect those who are not in government.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.980]   Clearly, these current sets of sanctions and restrictions are already affecting the lives
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.380]   of individual ordinary Russian citizens. In some way, it's an act of war. Basically, the
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   goal of these sanctions is to destabilize the country so that the population will rise
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.300]   up and ideally, in the mind of many of those advancing it, murder their president. Of course,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.860]   they would say, "Well, let's go ahead and do it in a democratic sense. Let's overthrow
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.700]   him and bring someone else in." They're going for regime change.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.420]   Now, time will tell. It remains to be seen what will happen. We'll be talking a good
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.260]   bit about the Ukraine and Russia situation in the days to come. The point is that, ethically
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.500]   speaking, very few people have any kind of reservation or qualms about seeing the assets
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.380]   of the Russian leaders and Russian government seized, frozen, and seeing them cut off from
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.700]   the banking system, etc., because of their evil invasion of their neighbor.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.900]   The Canadian situation is one in which many people would also say, "Well, hey, look, these
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.020]   guys are breaking the law. They're making life unlivable for us in Ottawa. We got to
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.100]   get them out." Going after their money is the way to do it. Again, I have significant
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.500]   concerns, which I've expressed about this, but a lot of people feel that way.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.020]   One of the interesting things about Executive Order 6102 and the true history of what happened
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:28.060]   in the United States is nobody except the government was being hurt by the hoarding,
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.340]   quote-unquote, what they alleged, using their words, of gold. As you'll see as I go into
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:42.780]   the actual history, the US government stole money directly from its citizens and seized
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.460]   the assets of its citizens exclusively to maintain power. We will go over their alleged
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.380]   reasoning and you can judge for yourself the ethics of it, but let's begin with the actual
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:01.820]   history. I'm going to be reading to you the Wikipedia entry for Executive Order 6102.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:10.220]   Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933 by US President Franklin
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:16.420]   Delano Roosevelt. He's always all of our favorite presidents, right? Quote, "Forbidding
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:24.260]   the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.500]   States," close quote. The executive order was made under the authority of the Trading
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act in March 1933. The
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.180]   limitation on gold ownership in the United States was repealed after President Gerald
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:51.220]   Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars, and certificates by an
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:09:00.660]   act of Congress, codified in publication L. 93373, which went into effect December 31,
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:12.300]   1974. Rationale. The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused "hoarding
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:20.300]   of gold, stalling economic growth, and worsening the Depression as the US was then using the
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:28.740]   gold standard for its currency." On April 6, 1933, the New York Times wrote, under the
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.860]   headline "Hoarding of Gold," quote, "The executive order issued by the President yesterday
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:42.300]   amplifies and particularizes his earlier warnings against hoarding." On March 6, taking advantage
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:49.220]   of a wartime statute that had not been repealed, he issued Presidential Proclamation 2039 that
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:57.380]   forbade the hoarding of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency under penalty of $10,000
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.980]   and/or up to 5 to 10 years imprisonment. The main rationale behind the order was actually
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.900]   to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:18.780]   during the Depression. The Federal Reserve Act 1913 required 40% gold backing of Federal
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.100]   Reserve notes that were issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost reached
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.660]   the limit of allowable credit in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes, which could
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.780]   be backed by the gold in its possession.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.540]   Now let me interrupt the article here to clarify. I've just read you under the section marked
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:44.180]   Rationale from the Wikipedia article. But remember that what they did was use, first
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:53.900]   of all, an authority that was made law under the World War I situation. So the President
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:02.620]   at that time, President Franklin Roosevelt, used an act, a piece of legislation that was
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:09.980]   signed in 1917 under the previous World War I. Note, of course, that at this time we were
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.060]   in the Great Depression in the United States. This is prior to World War II. But this particular
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.780]   law had never been repealed. And the lesson that I, reason I'm emphasizing this is, this
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.980]   is why I get so concerned and why I publicly talk about any kind of issue that involves
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.740]   some expansion of government authority, especially something that doesn't have a clear sunset
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:42.180]   clause. So in Canada, for example, we now see that there is a clear precedent for the
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:48.380]   Canadian Prime Minister to authorize institutions to go after people who are protesting in the
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:55.900]   streets without ever actually following through the legally required parliamentary debate,
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:02.380]   legally required parliamentary approval, etc. The recent situation in Canada was done under
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:09.340]   the Emergency Measures Act, which was updated from the War, what was it, the War Protection
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.140]   Act or something like that, something related to Emergency War Measures Act, something like
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:21.740]   that before. And the idea here is you see how legislators use whatever legislation they
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:27.900]   can find on the books to authorize their actions. Now, what was the actual thing that was happening?
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.740]   Well, people were saving money. They were in the middle of a Great Depression. They
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.460]   understood the value of their money and they wanted to save their money. At that time,
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:44.180]   that's what gold was. Gold was money. Federal Reserve notes at that time depended upon the
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:50.820]   fact that gold was money in order to have their validity. And the Federal Reserve was
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.840]   trying to make sure that its notes were widely accepted, but they had to be constrained.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.260]   And so the government could not spend as much money, could not borrow as much money as they
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:07.140]   wanted. They couldn't issue as many notes because they were required to have gold at
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:13.540]   a 40% ratio. They were required to have at least 40% of their Federal Reserve notes value
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:20.700]   on hand as gold, gold money, gold dollars. And so they're finding their ability to print
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.980]   money, finance all of their things constrained by the fact that US citizens are holding gold.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:34.780]   So what should they do? Well, let's just tell the citizens they can't hold gold. Brilliant.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.140]   Let's take away their money and tell them they can't hold gold. Then we'll take the
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.500]   gold. We'll now have it in a Federal Reserve vault. Then we can print more dollars. It's
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.380]   wonderful. And we'll just tell our citizens that they have to cough up their gold bullion
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:56.460]   or their gold coins, or we're going to penalize them a massive penalty. More on that in a
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.420]   moment or we're going to imprison them for up to five or 10 years. Remember at this time
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:10.940]   also that gold coins were standard forms of money in the same way that today, a hundred
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.900]   dollar Federal Reserve note is a standard form of money. Gold coins were at that time
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:23.000]   a standard form of money. A $20 gold piece was issued, created by the US Mint and was
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.900]   commonly used in circulation. So when the government came out with this and said, we're
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:36.400]   going to fine you or we're going to jail you if you keep your gold coins, they were telling
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.740]   people you can't keep the $20 gold piece that we minted and distributed two years ago. By
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:50.340]   the way, point of interest, what was a $10,000 fine like? Well, if we go to an inflation
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:58.540]   calculator using all of the standard inflation measurements, the consumer price index, and
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:05.820]   we go back and see what was the value of a $10,000 fine in 1933. In 2022 dollars, it
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:17.060]   was $216,267. Since that time, almost basically 90 years ago when this law was passed, there's
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:27.580]   been a cumulative rate of inflation of 2,062.7%, which a lot of it is related to exactly what
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:33.420]   we're talking about here. So they wanted to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:39.100]   from increasing the money supply by banning the ownership of gold coins. Now pay attention
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.020]   because as we get to the end of this show, after I go over the history, I'm going to
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.560]   talk to you about how you can protect yourself from this. I'm going to talk to you also about
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:51.780]   a brand new course that I'm launching that's giving modern equivalents to this, but let's
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.780]   continue through the history.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:03.940]   Effects. Executive Order 6102 required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:11.140]   all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:19.960]   to the Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 per troy ounce. By the way, let me interrupt
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:27.740]   the article. Let's do a quick inflation calculation of $20.67. That would be in 1933. Today, that
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:35.540]   would be $447 per ounce. That would be the equivalent rate. Interestingly, today's spot
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:46.080]   price of gold, again March 1, 2022, is $1,945 per ounce.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.100]   The Executive Order required all persons to deliver on or before May 1, 1933, all but
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.140]   a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:01.580]   Federal Reserve in exchange for $20.67 per troy ounce. Under the Trading with the Enemy
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:09.020]   Act of 1917, as amended by the recently passed Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, a
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   violation of the order was punishable by fine up to $10,000 (equivalent in today's world
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:24.620]   of more than $200,000) up to 10 years in prison or both. The order specifically exempted "customary
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:30.340]   use in industry, profession, or art"—a provision that covered artists, jewelers,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.740]   scientists, sign makers, etc. The order also permitted any person to own up to $100 in
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:45.020]   gold coins, a face value equivalent to 5 troy ounces (160 grams) of gold valued at approximately
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.620]   $10,000 in 2020.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.540]   So let me clarify. Again, you could keep 5 gold coins. Remember, at that time, there
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:03.380]   was a provision for you to have a standard piece of money, so you could keep up to 5
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:12.740]   of your standard $20 gold pieces of US dollars at that time. If we do the inflation calculation,
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.860]   it's more or less $10,000. Ironically, we see then that gold at a price of just under
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.900]   $2,000 an ounce would be similar to today. Basically, you could have about 5 ounces of
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.460]   gold or $10,000 in modern coins.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.420]   So it's important that you understand this to understand how the actual confiscation
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:42.060]   occurred. There was an exemption. You could say, "Hey, you could have $10,000." And
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:49.700]   it's up to you to judge whether or not you consider $10,000 to be a lot of money or a
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.100]   little bit of money when it comes to your life savings.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.740]   The same paragraph also exempted "gold coins having recognized special value to collectors
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.600]   of rare and unusual coins, which protected recognized gold coin collectors from legal
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.380]   seizure and likely melting." The price of gold from the Treasury for international transactions
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:16.980]   was then raised by the Gold Reserve Act to $35 an ounce, equivalent to $700 in 2020.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:23.940]   The resulting profit that the government realized funded the Exchange Stabilization Fund established
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.860]   by the 1934 Gold Reserve Act.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:37.060]   I interrupt the article to clarify. They gave you as a citizen $20.67 per ounce for your
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:44.220]   gold. Then, shortly thereafter, as soon as everyone had put in all of their gold coins
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.540]   and submitted them to the central treasury, they revalued the dollar and they raised it.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:57.420]   They raised the price of gold from $20 to $35 an ounce. Not quite halving, but pretty
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:05.420]   much almost half. Basically, stealing half of your money. If you had kept your ounce
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.860]   of gold valued at just over $20 and simply waited a few months in the international marketplace,
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:19.020]   you could have then received $35 for your previous $20 worth of gold. So a direct stealing
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:28.300]   of value from the American people in order to fund the Exchange Stabilization Fund.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.100]   Continuing with the article. The regulations prescribed in the Executive Order were modified
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.220]   by Executive Order 6111 on April 20, 1933, both of which were ultimately revoked and
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:45.260]   superseded by Executive Orders 6260 and 6261 on August 28 and 29, 1933, respectively. Executive
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:53.460]   Order 6102 also led to the extreme rarity of the 1933 double-legal gold coin. The order
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:59.420]   caused all gold coin production to cease and all 1933 minted coins to be destroyed. About
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.580]   20 illegal coins were stolen, leading to an outstanding U.S. Secret Service warrant for
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:10.820]   arrest and confiscation of the coin. Illegalized surviving coins sold for over $7.5 million
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.620]   in 2002, making it one of the most valuable coins in the world.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:21.700]   So the question is, well, was anybody prosecuted? Did anybody have their gold taken? Did anybody
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.460]   do time in prison? Let's answer that question. The truth is actually worse than you might
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:32.260]   think because, while there weren't a lot of prosecutions, the legal basis for prosecution
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.100]   was actually confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:42.060]   Prosecutions. Numerous individuals and companies were prosecuted relating to Roosevelt's
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.920]   Executive Order 6102. The prosecutions took place under the subsequent Executive Orders
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:56.140]   6111, 6260, 6261, and the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. There was a need to strengthen Executive
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.580]   Order 6102 as the one prosecution under the order was ruled invalid by federal judge John
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:08.060]   M. Woolsey on the grounds that the order was signed by the President, instead of the Secretary
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:14.100]   of Treasury, as required. The circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:22.100]   named Frederick Barber Campbell had one deposit at Chase National Bank of over 5,000 troy
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.900]   ounces of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:37.020]   sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day, September 27,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:44.860]   1933, for failing to surrender his gold. Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:54.100]   authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.840]   confiscated. By the way, pay careful attention to these examples, because in hearing the
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.360]   examples of what has happened in the past, you will be enlightened as to some of the
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.700]   methodology that you can use to protect yourself in the future.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.820]   The case was caused for the Roosevelt administration to issue a new order under the signature of
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:22.700]   the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, Jr. Executive Orders 6260-6261 related to
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:30.060]   the seizure of gold and the prosecution of gold hoarders. A few months later, Congress
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:36.100]   passed the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, which ratified Roosevelt's orders. A new set of
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:42.740]   Treasury regulations was issued, providing civil penalties of confiscation of all gold
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:50.100]   and imposition of fines equal to double the value of the gold seized. Did you hear that?
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.780]   A new set of Treasury regulations was issued, providing civil penalties of confiscation
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:03.140]   of all gold and imposition of fines equal to double the value of the gold seized. You
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:10.220]   have $100,000 worth of gold. They're going to seize your gold and impose fines of $200,000
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.580]   that you now have to pay. With, of course, money that you have to earn from working,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.020]   which of course in today's world you pay income taxes on, and then you pay your fines
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.060]   and/or other assets that you have to cash in to pay your fines.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.500]   Continuing, prosecutions of US citizens and non-citizens followed the new orders with
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:36.860]   a few notable cases. Gus Farber, a diamond and jewelry merchant from San Francisco, was
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:44.220]   prosecuted for the sale of 13 $20 gold coins without a license. Secret Service agents discovered
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:50.620]   the sale with the help of the buyer. Farber, his father, and 12 others were arrested in
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:56.660]   four American cities after a sting operation conducted by the Secret Service. The arrests
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:02.300]   took place simultaneously in New York and three California cities, San Francisco, San
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:09.660]   Jose, and Oakland. Morris Anilic was arrested in New York with $5,000 in US and foreign
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:17.140]   gold coins. Dan Levin and Edward Friedman of San Jose were arrested with $15,000 in
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:24.300]   gold. Sam Nankin was arrested in Oakland. In San Francisco, nine men were arrested on
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:31.420]   charges of hoarding gold. In all, $24,000 in gold was seized by Secret Service agents
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:39.540]   during the operation. David Baraban and his son Jacob owned a refining company. The Barabans'
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:45.620]   license to deal in unmelted scrap gold was revoked, and so the Barabans operated their
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:52.380]   refining business under a license issued to a "mini-sarch." The Barabans admitted
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.900]   that "mini-sarch" had nothing to do with the business and that she had obtained the
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:02.100]   license so that the Barabans could continue to deal in gold. The Barabans had a cigar
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:08.820]   box full of gold-filled scrap jewelry visible in one of the showcases. Government agents
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.020]   raided the Barabans' business and found another hidden box of US and foreign gold
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:22.440]   coins. The coins were seized, and Baraban was charged with conspiracy to defraud the
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:29.540]   United States. Louis Rufino was one individual indicted on three counts purporting to violations
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:35.460]   of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, which restricted trade with countries hostile
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:41.140]   to the United States. Eventually, Rufino appealed the conviction to the Circuit Court of Appeals,
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:47.940]   9th District in 1940. However, the judgment of the lower courts was upheld based on the
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:54.620]   Barabans' executive orders and the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Rufino, a resident of
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:01.020]   Sutter Creek in California gold country, was convicted of possessing 78 ounces of gold
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:09.140]   and was sentenced to six months in jail, paid a $500 fine, and had his gold seized.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:15.340]   Foreigners also had gold confiscated and were forced to accept paper money for their gold.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:24.100]   The Ubersee Finance Corporation, a Swiss banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins for
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:30.020]   business use. The Ubersee Finance Corporation entrusted the gold to an American firm for
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:36.460]   safekeeping, and the Swiss were shocked to find that their gold was confiscated. The
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.700]   Swiss made appeals, but they were denied. They were entitled to paper money, but not
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:47.780]   their gold. The Swiss company would have lost 40% of their gold's value if they had tried
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.580]   to buy the same amount of gold with the paper money they received in exchange for their
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.980]   confiscated gold.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:01.260]   Another type of de facto gold seizure occurred as a result of the various executive orders
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:09.100]   involving bonds, gold certificates, and private contracts. Private contracts, or bonds that
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:15.420]   were written in terms of gold, were to be paid in paper currency instead of gold, although
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.660]   all of the contracts and the bonds proclaimed that they were payable in gold, and at least
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:27.540]   one, the Fourth Liberty Bond, was a federal instrument. The plaintiffs in all cases received
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:34.380]   paper money instead of gold, despite the contract's terms. The contracts and the bonds were written
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:40.780]   precisely to avoid currency debasement by requiring payment in gold coin. The paper
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:49.140]   money, which was redeemable in gold, was instead irredeemable based on Nortz v. United States.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.660]   The consolidated gold clause cases were the following, Perry v. United States, U.S. v.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:29:00.100]   Bankers Trust Company, Norman v. Baltimore and Ohio R. Company, Nortz v. United States.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:09.380]   The Supreme Court upheld all seizures as "constitutional," with Justices James Clark McReynolds, Willis
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:15.700]   Van Deventer, George Sutherland, and Pierce Butler dissenting. The four justices were
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.580]   labeled the "four horsemen" by the compliant press, as their conservative views were in
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:28.620]   opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal, supported by the press.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:35.620]   Sound familiar? You have a populist president who comes in with massive support, says "I'm
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:41.580]   going to solve your problems," passes some of the most wide-ranging sets of legislation
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.540]   in American history, but the press is cheering him on. And because the press is cheering
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.820]   him on, then anybody who stands for things like constitutional right to privacy or the
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.180]   right to be safe in your person's papers and effects, or the right to not be stolen
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.420]   up by the U.S. government, well, very quickly, those four justices were labeled the "four
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.300]   horsemen" by the compliant press, as their conservative views were in opposition to Roosevelt's
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.860]   New Deal, which was supported by the press.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:15.500]   So the examples, I think, are important to see. Because you can see in the examples of
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:21.260]   the cases listed here how the government seeks to enforce what it does.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:27.540]   Number one, if there is previous evidence or a paper trail related to your ownership
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:36.420]   of the gold, such as here the attorney, Frederick Campbell, who had deposited at the bank 5,000
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.220]   troy ounces, well now there's a formal paper trail saying "here is my 5,000 troy ounces."
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.100]   And so he goes to withdraw his gold, most likely because the government is passing a
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.140]   law saying they're going to seize his gold, and Chase refuses to give them the gold. The
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:58.180]   bank refuses to return the money. Why? Well, because the bank is scared of the government.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.500]   The bank receives its license to exist and make money because of the government. And
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:09.260]   so it's basically an arm of the government. A lot of people get mad when I say "all financial
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.980]   representatives are unpaid spies of the U.S. government." And it's the same all around
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:22.700]   the world in many countries. It's just a statement of fact as far as I can see it, that bankers
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:28.420]   are charged, legally speaking, to spy for the U.S. government, to watch out for things
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:33.180]   like money laundering. I used to be one, meaning I used to be a financial advisor. Every single
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.860]   year we sit down and we give classes on money laundering, and it's required in order for
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.980]   the company to stay out of legal trouble with the government. Well in this case, of course,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:47.280]   the banker is observing what's happening, and the bank refuses to abide by the terms
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:53.880]   of its depository relationship and instead enforces the gold seizure from the U.S. government.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:32:01.320]   So Campbell gets angry and he sues the bank for breach of contract. And what do they do?
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.160]   The federal prosecutor, clearly informed by the bank, then indicts Campbell on the following
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.820]   day for failing to surrender his gold. So that's the first thing, his paper trail.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:19.420]   Second thing relating to it is always a sting operation. You have to remember that many,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:27.980]   many people gain their sense of superiority. People love to inform on the neighbors that
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.980]   they don't like. Now you can have a very unified population. If there is an issue where there's
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.820]   a unified population of people that see the world in the same way, then of course they'll
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.380]   stand together and support one another. But if you don't have a unified population, you
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.500]   have one segment of the population that sees the other segment of the population is not
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.300]   doing the right thing, then they quickly inform on one another. So think about places where
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:33:00.420]   there's, I don't know, people make fake vaccine cards. Well, all your friends that are anti-vaccine,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.580]   they'll stand with you. All your friends that are pro-vaccine will inform on you because
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.460]   they see what you're doing as an evil wrong. With taxes, you see this. The IRS will pay
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:16.380]   whistleblowers, whistleblowers, people who inform about tax cheats, they will pay them
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:23.780]   a significant portion, I think it's almost half of the amount of money seized from the
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:29.020]   company or from the individual that is prosecuted for tax evasion. Probably one of the most
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:36.660]   famous cases for this over the last few years is from the Swiss banker who went to the IRS
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.860]   and took lots of private information from, he was working for UBS, and ultimately he
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:48.060]   earned over a hundred million dollars by informing on UBS. He served a couple years, I think
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:56.540]   two and a half years in prison for fraud after a fraud conspiracy conviction, but the IRS
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.780]   paid him over a hundred million dollars for informing on UBS for tax evasion. And they
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.820]   ultimately succeeded in pressing their case. And so this is one of the things that happens
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.340]   all the time. It happens on a public basis with companies. If a company is engaging in
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.780]   some kind of tax evasion, then the IRS takes informants on that. It also happens with any
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.980]   private individual, right? You evade your taxes, you tell your girlfriend about the
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.020]   fact that you don't do it, then you dump her and she gets angry and disappears. Or
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:32.460]   your ex-wife informs on the fact that you don't pay taxes. And then any money that's
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:41.780]   seized, that person, the informant, will be eligible for a significant portion of it.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:48.460]   I wanted to get the numbers right, so I went to irs.gov. It's not 40%. And they have
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.820]   a section here on what happens to a claim for an informant award, a whistleblower. And
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.180]   it says the amount of the award will be at least 15%, but not more than 30% of collected
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:03.180]   proceeds in cases in which the service determines that the information submitted substantially
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:08.780]   contributed to the service's detection and recovery of tax. So somewhere between 15 to
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:16.020]   30% of the amount collected by the IRS. And they have a handy number here, report suspected
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:21.660]   tax fraud. So remember that there's always informants. In this case, the Secret Service
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:29.860]   ran a sting operation using informants to seize the gold and the assets of the farmers
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   and their business. The trading company coming along, what do they do? Well, they require
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.700]   a license to deal in unmelted scrap gold. Licensing systems, the same basic problem.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.800]   And so they have a license, but the license is issued to somebody else, and they admit
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.620]   that she's just their licensee, they're charged, all their money is seized, etc. And then of
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:58.780]   course, you have the Swiss bank, excuse me, the Swiss company, Swiss bank, which had $1.25
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.700]   million in gold coins on deposit in the United States for their business use. And then they
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.700]   just find that their gold was confiscated. So sucks to be you for counting on the United
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.020]   States of America in 1933 to actually protect your money. That was dumb. And you shouldn't
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.860]   have done that. And this is basically the same thing that you see all over the world.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:22.020]   Right? Imagine today that you have some money abroad, you have to be very careful because
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.340]   put money in Canada, or any significant money in Canada, it sucks to be you. Canadian government
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.940]   has a reputation of doing this. And so you want to be very thoughtful who you trust your
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.020]   money to, and you want to pay attention to see what kinds of changes are happening in
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:40.300]   their laws. So we can learn from these events. Let's continue.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:46.740]   Subsequent events and abrogation. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made gold clauses unenforceable
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:52.660]   and authorized the president to establish the gold value of the dollar by proclamation.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:58.860]   Isn't it wonderful? Right? Let's take away previous legislation that had, that used the
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.260]   power of gold to restrain government. And let's create a new piece of legislation that
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:09.120]   allows the president, the government, to establish the gold value by proclamation. Immediately
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:16.020]   following its passage, Roosevelt changed the statutory price of gold from $20.67 to $35
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:22.620]   per ounce, thereby devaluing the US dollar, which was based on gold. That price remained
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:29.140]   in effect until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the US would
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:35.340]   no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, thus abandoning the gold standard for
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:43.380]   foreign exchange. See the Nixon shock articles. By the way, I consider that also to be one
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:54.140]   of the most beautifully recorded historical examples of proven deception. Deception isn't
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:38:01.420]   strong enough. I'll write cheating. Deception, I guess, is the best thing. By the US government.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.420]   I don't want to get too off topic to dive much into that, but let me just tell you a
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:13.380]   quick moment of what actually happened in that. I'll read here from an article called
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:20.140]   "Vox Populi, Vox Suckers," published back in the early 2000s by recently deceased economist
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:26.260]   Gary North. He wrote this, "Immediately after the devaluation of the pound," this is two
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.300]   years later, in November 1967, the British government devalued the pound. "The Chancellor
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.780]   of the Exchequer had of course sworn that this was not being contemplated. A few weeks
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.100]   before this event, I, he being Gary North, I attended the first international gold conference
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.340]   in history. It was sponsored by Harry Schultz. The hard money newsletter publisher was held
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.740]   in Los Angeles. Rush Dooney paid my admission. I wrote it up in a report dated November 17,
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:54.420]   1967, the coming credit crunch. Immediately after the devaluation of the pound, gold began
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:02.380]   to rise. In 1968, the US and European central banks imposed a two-tier gold market. Central
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:09.020]   banks could buy gold from the US at $35, but agreed not to sell gold to the public at this
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.060]   price. Gold's free market price began to move up by a few dollars above $35. Still,
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:22.820]   the outflow of gold from the Treasury continued. So, on August 15, 1971, Nixon closed the gold
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:28.020]   window. The Secretary of the Treasury, John Connolly, had sworn to the media for weeks
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:32.380]   that no such move was being contemplated. I shall never forget his press conference
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.540]   on August 16. He admitted openly that he had lied. "If I had told the truth, there would
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:43.140]   immediately have been a rush by foreign central banks to buy our gold." The press nodded
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:49.420]   dutifully and nobody in the mainstream media complained. Price controls. Nixon also froze
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:56.480]   all domestic prices that day. No discussion, no democracy, just one-man rule. Within days,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:02.260]   the United States Chamber of Commerce backed this move against freedom. So did the National
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.940]   Association of Manufacturers. Normally, a gallon of gasoline sold for over $0.35 in
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.020]   Southern California, but there was a gasoline price war that week. You could buy gasoline
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:17.400]   for about $0.22, a loss leader. Those stations got locked in. A lot of them went bankrupt
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.660]   over the next two years. That was when the shift to convenience store gas stations began.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.300]   Profits on the sale of candy, packaged foods, and sodas marked the end of the "service
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:36.380]   station" era. Ian had predicted this move in a 1970 article in the Whole Earth Catalog.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:41.900]   I had told readers to buy US silver coins. In 1970, I bought British gold sovereigns
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.300]   for $10 each, $40 an ounce.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.140]   Let's go back and I'm going to skip the article. Let me go back or any more of that and go
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:57.460]   back because the point is that the games didn't end when it became legal to buy gold. They
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:05.140]   implemented that price fix until 1971 and it was still illegal during the Nixon shock.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:15.620]   It was still illegal for anybody to own gold coins until 1974. Continuing the article,
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.580]   the private ownership of gold certificates was legalized in 1964 and they can be openly
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:27.100]   owned by collectors but are not redeemable in gold. The limitation on gold ownership
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.780]   in the United States was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill to "permit United
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:37.340]   States citizens to purchase, hold, sell, or otherwise deal with gold in the United States
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.960]   or abroad" with an act of Congress codified in publication L. 93373 which went into effect
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:52.660]   December 31, 1974. However, PL 93373 did not repeal the Gold Repeal Joint Resolution which
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.940]   banned any contract that specified payment in a fixed amount of money as gold or a fixed
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:04.460]   amount of gold. That is, contracts remained unenforceable if they used gold monetarily
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:14.080]   rather than as a commodity of trade. However, an act enacted on October 28, 1977 amended
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.160]   the 1933 joint resolution to make it clear that parties could again include so-called
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.600]   gold clauses in contracts made after 1977.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.400]   I'm going to go on and talk about similar laws in other countries and then come back
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.320]   to the hoax of safe deposit box seizures. Similar laws in other countries. In Poland,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.360]   a similar regulation was issued on November 7, 1919 which forced citizens to sell their
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.040]   gold and silver to the state. A month later, it was extended until January 31, 1920. In
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:48.120]   Australia, Part IV of the Banking Act 1959 allows the Commonwealth government to seize
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:54.400]   private citizens' gold in return for paper money where the Governor General is satisfied
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.920]   that it is expedient so to do, for the protection of the currency or of the public credit of
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:06.800]   the Commonwealth. On January 30, 1976, the operation of that part of the Act was suspended.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:14.640]   United Kingdom introduced the Gold Trade Ban Law at 1966 (Exchange Control Act 1947). It
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:20.360]   became illegal for UK residents to continue to hold more than four gold coins dated after
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:28.660]   1817 or to buy any gold coins unless they obtained collector license from Bank of England.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.320]   The reasoning was to prevent people from hoarding the gold while the cost of living and inflation
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.120]   increase. This Act was recalled in 1971.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:43.680]   So we can see that while of course I will always be hardest on the United States being
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:52.880]   a natural born US citizen, it's not purely a US phenomenon. Any government around the
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:01.560]   world that thinks it's in their best interest to seize their citizens' gold has historically
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.680]   done this. Now I don't expect, we'll go to the hoax in just a moment, but I don't
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:13.020]   expect this to happen again in the future because basically nobody owns gold anymore.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:17.440]   Could they do it? Sure, but I don't think it would make a difference. Today, if the
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.080]   US government banned gold coins, almost nobody would count. There would be a tiny percentage
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:29.600]   of us, people like me, who are 5% of the population, who would be bent out of shape about it. There
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.200]   would be probably 20 or 30% of people that would be worried about this. What does this
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.880]   mean? But they don't own gold coins. And then most people would say, well, hey, they
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.680]   said it's bad people hoarding gold. Can you believe that they're hoarding gold? But
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.500]   it wouldn't make a big deal. And at this point in time, we are very far gone from the
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:53.520]   gold standard. We're very far gone from any widespread ownership of gold, etc. Central
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.880]   banks do still own gold. I think you should own some gold. I think that gold still has
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.360]   an important place. But we are not in the same world we were 100 years ago because gold
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:14.840]   ownership today is not widespread. It was at that time. Remember, gold was money. Contracts
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:20.760]   were denominated in gold. The US dollar was tied to gold. All of that is now in the past.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:28.040]   The US dollar now has no value based upon any other instrument. It's a pure fiat currency
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:33.280]   that we use because it is widely accepted and the right floats freely. You can go in
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.520]   freely today, buy gold coins. They have, of course, implemented and maintained lots of
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:44.080]   significant reporting requirements. If you go and you buy gold, it's subject to currency
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.120]   transaction reports, etc. They get filed. But it's not illegal for you to do and you
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:56.040]   can you can engage in it. So I don't expect these laws in the future because gold, I don't
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.840]   think they would get much bang for the buck. And when a government does this, it does risk
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:06.480]   some kind of opprobrium from its citizenry. And so it needs to be worth it in order for
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:13.880]   the governing agents to maintain and to maintain their power and accomplish their stated goals.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:19.000]   But the question remains, what could they do this with in the future? Again, we'll get
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.680]   to that in a moment. Let's go back to the hoax of safe deposit box seizures. This is
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.640]   important to talk about because if you're going to talk about this, you need to get
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.360]   your history right. I'm doing my very best to be accurate with anything that I say. But
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:40.440]   there is an Internet hoax that says that somehow the IRS was going in and opening people's
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.160]   safety deposit boxes. Now, we know from some of the cases cited that if you did have safety
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:52.720]   deposit boxes, they weren't necessarily safe. But the Internet hoax does exaggerate what
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.600]   actually happened. It wouldn't surprise me if this particular hoax had been true, but
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.880]   it's not true. So you think, as we read about it, you think about whether or not this would
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.320]   surprise you if this had actually happened. But remember, it did not. Hoax of safe deposit
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:14.400]   box seizures. According to a hoax, Roosevelt ordered all safe deposit boxes in the country
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.600]   seized and searched for gold by an official of the Internal Revenue Service. A typical
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.200]   example of the text of the alleged order reads, quote, "By executive order of the President
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:31.280]   of the United States, March 9, 1933, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 5(b)
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:37.400]   of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended by Section 2 of the Act of March 9, 1933,
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:44.120]   in which Congress declared that a serious emergency exists, I, as President, do declare
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:49.240]   that the national emergency still exists, that the continued private hoarding of gold
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:55.800]   and silver by subjects of the United States poses a grave threat to the peace, equal justice,
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.320]   and well-being of the United States, and that appropriate measures must be taken immediately
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.680]   to protect the interests of our people. Therefore, I hereby proclaim that such gold and silver
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.440]   holdings are prohibited, and that all such coin, bullion, or other possessions of gold
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.000]   and silver be tendered within 14 days to agents of the government for compensation at the
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.240]   official price and the legal tender of the government. All safe deposit boxes in banks
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:30.800]   or financial institutions have been sealed. All sales or purchases or movements of such
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:38.160]   gold and silver are hereby prohibited. Your possession and/or safe deposit box to store
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.440]   them is known by the government from bank and insurance records. Therefore, your vault
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:50.160]   box must remain sealed and may only be opened in the presence of an agent of the Internal
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.880]   Revenue Service, by lawful order, the President of the United States.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.360]   Now, just a moment. I'll continue with the background. Remember, this is a hoax. But
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.720]   in what I just read, could you believe it? The most effective hoaxes are passed along
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.320]   widely because they are believable. That, to me, is the fundamental problem. I could
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:19.960]   easily believe that this actually was true history after I understand that Executive
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:28.440]   Order 6102 was true history. And so, it's not a very far distance from "you're not
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:34.200]   allowed to own gold" to "we're going to seal and order the banks to seal all safe
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.640]   deposit boxes." So, thankfully, this was a hoax. But I don't see anything in the
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:46.960]   hoax per se that would in and of itself be unbelievable or would violate any particular
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:57.040]   aspect of the law that actually was passed. So, they didn't do that, but I could believe
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.440]   that they would have done that in that measure. What I also just think about is that even
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:09.120]   the language of the hoax. Think back to what we talked about as about the Canadian situation
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.640]   a couple weeks ago. And just think about this language in the hoax. "I, as President,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.840]   do declare that the national emergency still exists, that the continued private hoarding
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:24.320]   of gold and silver by subjects of the United States poses a grave threat to the peace,
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.120]   equal justice, and well-being of the United States, and that appropriate measures must
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.480]   be taken immediately to protect the interests of our people." In some ways, that language
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:41.680]   sounds very much like the language of Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada a week or two ago.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.600]   Let me finish up the background of the hoax, and then we will talk about what to do about
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.800]   this. The first known reference to the hoax was in the book "After the Crash, Life in
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.120]   the New Great Depression." The fake text refers only to gold, not to silver, which
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.520]   was added by 1998 to internet references. It claims to be an executive order, but its
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.960]   text was written to apply it to specific individuals, your possession. And so, if the text originated
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.280]   from the government, it would have been sent to individuals, not published as an executive
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:13.040]   order. The first paragraph starts with the actual text of executive order 6102, then
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:18.320]   edits it slightly, changing "said national emergency" to "a national emergency"
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:24.040]   and "still continues to exist" to "still exists" and then adds invented text. The
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.160]   minor edits and the way that the real text and fake text are combined mid-sentence make
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.720]   it almost certainly an intentionally designed hoax rather than an accident. Most of the
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.640]   text does not appear in the actual executive order. In fact, safe deposit boxes held by
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:43.480]   individuals were not forcibly searched or seized under the order, and the few prosecutions
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:49.080]   that occurred in the 1930s for gold hoarding were executed under different statutes. One
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:55.800]   of the few such cases occurred in 1936, when a safety deposit box containing over 10,000
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:02.720]   troy ounces of gold belonging to Zilick Josefowicz, who was not a US citizen, was seized with
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.920]   a search warrant as part of a prosecution for tax evasion. The US Treasury also came
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.000]   into possession of a large number of safe deposit boxes due to bank failures. During
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.360]   the 1930s, over 3,000 banks failed, and the contents of their safe deposit boxes were
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.120]   remanded to the custody of the Treasury. If no one claimed the box, it remained in the
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.240]   possession of the Treasury. In October 1981, there were 1,605 cardboard cartons in the
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:32.680]   basement of the Treasury, each carton containing the contents of one unclaimed safe deposit
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   box.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:43.480]   I hope you can enjoy learning the lessons from that, and feel free to research or dig
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.320]   into the subject more your own. I find it fascinating. Here are some points that I would
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.120]   like to make in addition to what I've already said.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   1. I hope that when you take stories or warnings or you hear conspiracy theories, I hope that
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:05.000]   you stop and consider if they are actually plausible. One of the things that's been
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.880]   quite disconcerting to me over the years is I have come to believe that many stories,
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:20.520]   many predictions, many conspiracy theories, even many hoaxes are plausible based upon
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:31.360]   past experience, based upon past evidence. If I said to you today that, say, five years
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:38.160]   from now, the US government could seize your Bitcoin from you, in my opinion, that kind
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.600]   of prediction is plausible. They could do it. Will they do it? We don't know, because
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:49.800]   there is a system where they have to go based upon public constraint. If Bitcoin were widely
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.480]   acknowledged as being useful, people liked it, people used it, then they probably couldn't
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:58.880]   get away with it. If Bitcoin were seen as a way of getting evil money to evil Russian
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.640]   oligarchs, getting around all of the world sanctions on the Russian economy, that changes
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:10.520]   things. You could see so much why Bitcoin has been tarred and feathered by so many people,
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:17.040]   drug dealing, money laundering, Russian oligarchs, etc. So the point is that warnings like that,
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.840]   I consider them plausible. I remember years ago, I got interested in various conspiracy
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.240]   theories and I started studying some of the history of various theories, and I was shocked
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:33.440]   to find how much stuff actually happened. I found that a sobering experience. It's very
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.280]   sobering when you learn, you know what, when people have wacky conspiracy theories, I can't
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.240]   just dismiss them out of hand. I need to stop, I need to look for evidence, I need to think
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.640]   about it and consider them, because I can go through history and I can find some really
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:52.680]   wacky stuff that has happened over the time that would be unbelievable if I didn't know
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.760]   it was actually true. Kind of like it was to me about gold confiscation and it being
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.720]   illegal to own gold coins.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:07.280]   The reason I love this example so much also, let me expand this point for you, is it's
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:19.880]   hard to find something less damaging to you as an individual than a gold coin. Almost
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:27.400]   any other seizure is not quite that way. If the government comes and seizes a bale of
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:33.120]   marijuana, we think, well, you know, at the end of the day, maybe people shouldn't be
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.240]   doing marijuana. After all, it's going to make them stupid and lazy, so maybe people
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.960]   shouldn't be smoking marijuana. Or the government seizing a bunch of cocaine. Well, at the end
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.920]   of the day, that's really bad, that's, you know, destroying people. Or the government
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:56:02.400]   seizes a bunch of fentanyl. And you think, well, okay, they're seizing it, but I see
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.000]   the point. I understand the point and we're probably better off having it off the streets.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.960]   It takes a very committed person to say free markets, total liberty, etc., when you're
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   dealing with things like that. Or you come along and you say, well, what about civil
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.940]   asset forfeiture? And you say, well, you know, when they seize the speedboats of those nasty
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.400]   drug runners, they're putting a dent in the drug ring. Or when they seize a sports car
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:32.560]   and you go and you find the Miami Police Department logo and spray it all over some cigarette
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.560]   boat and you think, hey, you know, at least they got those nasty drug dealers off the
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.440]   street. Or if they make something illegal, then you say, prohibition, right? We make
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:48.720]   alcohol illegal. You say, well, at least people will drink less. And so you justify those
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.000]   things. In the modern world, again, I've already given examples of Russia. You say, at least
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.040]   they can get rid of Putin, right? He's pretty evil. At least that'll be good. And after
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.400]   all, I'm for the Ukrainians. But when you look at this example of banning the use of
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:07.760]   gold coins, what you see is that it is exclusively about the interests of the United States.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.400]   Now, a fair-minded individual would say, well, the interest of the United States is for the
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.600]   flourishing of its people. So therefore, if the United States can increase its money supply
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.160]   and the people can improve, maybe that could get us out of the depression, right? This
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.600]   is the classic argument that we all argue about. Went into the Great Depression, did
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:27.080]   the government actions help or hinder? Was it harmful or was it helpful? And we'll save
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:33.400]   that discussion for another day. But I think clearly you see here that this is backroom
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:42.240]   dealing and the only people that benefit are government representatives, government agents.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:48.600]   They made the most traditional thing you could ever own, right? Gold coins, we've got them
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:54.160]   back to the Romans and probably before. Thousands and thousands of years of history of people
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.920]   using gold coins as money. This is money. This is a product that didn't come in from
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:04.560]   overseas. This is a product that the US government made, stamping out gold coins. And the system
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:11.960]   was intentionally designed to be a check on government excess. That's how it was designed.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:17.560]   The original Federal Reserve Act itself was a nightmare, but it was designed to be a check
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:23.120]   on government excess. So they come in, use a time of extreme duress, extreme economic
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.680]   hardship and say, we're going to change all the laws and we're going to make it illegal
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:37.880]   for you to own gold because you're hoarding your money. Think about the use of that word,
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.800]   right? In past pandemic, in a previous conversations, I've talked about how the difference between
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:48.520]   stockpiling and hoarding, right? And so I think there is an example of hoarding, but
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:54.640]   most of the time it's used in a pejorative sense. I remember back when we're at the beginning
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:59.480]   of the pandemic, right? And I did, I think I did shows and I talked about when they came
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.280]   in and they stole a bunch of masks from a guy who had bought them and they accused him
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.520]   of hoarding and they did thousands of masks that he was selling to doctors on the secondary
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.380]   market and the FBI came in and they raided his house and they stole his masks. I try
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.120]   to stick up for my principles that I didn't, it wasn't wrong. That was, that wasn't right.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:23.480]   Talked about it on Twitter, almost, not almost. I got a great, I got a great group of listeners
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.200]   that understand arguing things from the basis of principle, but 80% of the response was,
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:33.400]   how could you believe this guy is price gouging people on the cost of the masks? And you always
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:39.400]   think, well, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe, but when it's gold coins, nobody was harmed
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:44.280]   by your ownership of gold coins in any way. But the government says you're hoarding money
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:48.520]   and you're not allowed to hoard money. So we're just going to take it from you. Now,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:53.940]   bring that to a modern context. Think for example, about things like wealth taxes. Think
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:59.960]   about even the income tax itself. See, we're not in 1933 anymore. I don't expect any kind
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:07.280]   of, of repeat of this particular set of laws related to gold, but this same theory holds
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:14.200]   true in other ways. And you got a bunch of people with similar theories to president
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:21.640]   Roosevelt trying to build a utopia with their covetous actions. Now, brings me to the next
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:27.120]   question. Don't think that it was better back then. There's often this sense that we have,
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   and especially people who are politically conservative or, or sympathetic to conservatism
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.480]   in some way often have the sense of, well, it was better before. No, not necessarily.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.440]   It wasn't necessarily better before. Some things were better. Some things were worse.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.040]   But today, some things are much better. Some things are worse. History is a mixed bag and
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.200]   don't fall prey to the golden era fallacy to think that, well, in 1933, they really
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:59.640]   believed in constitutional rights. Nonsense. Constitution. They, they, they affirmed everything
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:05.120]   I've just described here as constitutional. The press cheered it on. It all happened.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.640]   So what can you do? I don't know how to change a governmental system. I don't know how to
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:15.040]   do it. All I know is to say, what can we learn about how to protect ourselves? First lessons
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.280]   do relate to gold coins. I think these are the least, not least important, but just the
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.320]   least likely again, I do for reasons stated several times. Now I don't expect this to
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:31.880]   happen again. Nobody owns gold anymore, but if you do own gold, this is why in my opinion,
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.560]   you buy it privately. If you're going to go through the hassle of buying gold, owning
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.160]   gold, storing gold, then as I've stated in Q and A shows, what I've been asked about
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.560]   the subject, just go that last extra step and own it privately. It is today legal anywhere
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:56.160]   in the United States for you to walk into any, to a gold shop, a coin shop, and to do
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:02.240]   business in cash and for you to buy gold coins. You'll pay a slight premium to deal with a
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.400]   dealer of course. You will have some hassle factor of your having to physically go and
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.360]   do that. You may want to separate your transactions into modest amounts so that there's no currency
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.000]   transaction reports that have to be filed on behalf of the dealer. No, no, no, no name
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.080]   and information required, et cetera, but it's perfectly legal to do what I have described
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:29.300]   and you can own your gold. And at least that way, if a law were to be passed in the future,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:36.060]   you would have less exposure, less risk. The power of gold among other things is that it's
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:43.680]   an incredibly compact traditional store of wealth with a long and storied history and
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.920]   it doesn't have any kind of physical trails attached. It doesn't have any kind of registration
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.120]   documents required. It's just a little coin and that's really powerful, especially in
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.920]   times of duress when the government is passing these immoral laws like we've talked about
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.720]   with executive order 1602. It's really useful to have that feature. And even in the modern
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.480]   world, in a moment I'm going to talk about a new Bitcoin privacy, how to buy Bitcoin
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.080]   immediately class that I'm working on with a friend of mine that will be launching, that
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.760]   we have ready to launch. But one of the things that's so fascinating about it is for all
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.420]   of the promises of Bitcoin, and I'm on board for all the promises of Bitcoin, gold is still
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:33.760]   better from a privacy perspective. It's just different. The fact that you could put $100,000
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.880]   worth of value in gold coins in a coffee can stuck in your backyard and unless somebody
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.160]   passes over the top of the metal detector, most likely because they knew that you're
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.840]   there, it's pretty powerful. As we get into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency privacy stuff,
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.320]   you need to have a basic level of knowledge about how to do it. You don't have to be super
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.360]   sophisticated to buy it privately, but you do need to have a basic level of knowledge.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.640]   Gold coins, it's a lot simpler. Buy it, pay cash, take delivery, keep your mouth shut.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.260]   Everybody knows you have it. That's powerful. It's as powerful today as it was in 1933.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:17.600]   So when you're buying gold coins for your personal collection, do that. Pay cash, take
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.600]   delivery, keep your mouth shut. And then you'll have the power of knowing that you have an
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:30.840]   asset that you can own without anybody else necessarily knowing. Related to that, I personally
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:38.040]   give a lot of attention to the idea of the safety deposit hoax. Again, I don't think
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:47.800]   it unreasonable to believe that the government could, in a time of duress or in a time of
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.840]   emergency action or something, I don't believe it unreasonable to believe that they could
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:59.640]   issue a proclamation like was issued in that hoax, meaning we're sealing all the safety
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:05.720]   deposit boxes. And what's unfortunate is in the modern world, a safety deposit box
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:11.600]   with a financial institution is considered to have an account. Then it comes in under
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:17.480]   all of the banking regulations. So as you're going to arrange for storage of your gold,
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.280]   then I think it's better to go with some form of private storage with a non-banking
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:29.560]   entity if possible. I don't think, and you ask, "Well, how big of a deal is that?"
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.400]   Well, I don't think it's that big of a deal, but if you're going about it and you're
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.960]   going to be paying for a safety deposit box, you might consider simply transacting with
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.000]   a private secure storage company rather than a bank for the reasons stated.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:51.720]   The next lesson is diversify your holdings. I always think about that attorney. Just imagine
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:06:00.800]   that guy, Barb Campbell, 5,000 ounces of gold. For all we know, that may have been
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:08.000]   his life savings. I think it probably was. I wish I had more information on him and I
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.320]   wish I could read a book that was written about that particular case. It would be interesting
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.280]   to do so. In fact, I just found, I hadn't previously clicked on the link, here's an
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:26.640]   article with more details on the case, specifically in Time Magazine, published October 9, 1933.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.120]   Let me read this because it's about the details of the case and I think it'll be
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:35.880]   instructive. "Gold Indictment #1," name of the article. "On October 11, 1932,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.760]   an elderly Manhattan attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell marched into Chase National
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.980]   Bank followed by an armed guard trundling 13 bars of gold. Mr. Campbell had just drawn
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.240]   this bullion from the Federal Reserve Bank in return for gold certificates. Each bar,
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:57.040]   worth approximately $5,000, had been cast by the U.S. Treasury and bore its stamp and
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:03.000]   number. Lawyer Campbell arranged for the Chase Bank to act as hired custodian for his bullion.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.240]   On January 25, 1933, Mr. Campbell again appeared at Chase National Bank with 14 more gold bars
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.040]   which were stowed away in the vault with the first batch. By gold standard reckoning, his
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:20.520]   total deposit of metal amounted to $135,000. On March 9, Congress passed the Emergency
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.460]   Banking Act, which empowered the President to call all gold into the Treasury, with heavy
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:33.240]   penalties for those who disobeyed his orders. At that time, $1.4 billion in gold was in
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.160]   circulation, most of it hoarded. In the next 30 days, more than one-third of this was turned
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.840]   into the Treasury. On April 5, President Roosevelt issued an
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:46.280]   executive order requiring holders of gold to turn it into the Treasury in exchange for
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.860]   paper currency under penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and $10,000 fine. Department
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:08:00.760]   of Justice agents began visiting known hoarders who, to date, have surrendered $38,901,009
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:07.420]   in gold. During the same period, unknown hoarders have given up more than $300 million. Attorney
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:16.360]   General Cummings issued threat of prosecution against recalcitrants who still held $560,201,000.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:22.060]   On August 28, President Roosevelt issued another order requiring every possessor of gold to
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:27.340]   register his holdings with the Treasury before September 18. Those who failed to do so were
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:34.060]   also to be punished by 10 years' imprisonment, $10,000 fine. On September 16, lawyer Campbell
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:39.780]   appeared at Chase National Bank, demanded his 27 bars of gold. The bank told him that
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.740]   under the law it could not deliver them to him, but would have to surrender them to the
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.820]   government in accordance with the President's orders. On September 26, Mr. Campbell started
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:54.220]   a civil suit in Manhattan federal court to compel the bank to release his gold deposits.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:58.560]   In his petition, he argued that the President's orders, which prevented him from regaining
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:05.120]   his property, were unconstitutional. On September 27, after an 18-minute session, a federal
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.380]   grand jury in Manhattan indicted Frederick Barber Campbell for failing to register gold
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:21.340]   now valued at $200,574.34 before September 18, as required by the August 28 order. Also
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:26.740]   imminent was a second indictment charging actual hoarding of gold in violation of the
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.340]   April 5 order. Thus, last week was President Roosevelt's
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:38.420]   whole gold policy started on its winding way to the Supreme Court for a major test on constitutionality.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:43.100]   If Defendant Campbell is convicted by a jury, and the Supreme Court sustains his conviction,
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:47.660]   the Department of Justice will be on solid legal ground to move against some 30,000 citizens
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:52.640]   who have so far defied the President's gold orders. If Defendant Campbell wins a Supreme
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.740]   Court appeal, the administration's whole gold program will be set at naught, and President
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:03.420]   Roosevelt will have to start all over again conserving the Treasury's gold supply.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:07.800]   In Defendant Campbell, the government picked for this test not only the largest gold hoarder
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:14.220]   on its list, but also a respectable lawyer, whom Prosecutor Medley called "exceedingly
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:20.280]   able." Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Campbell graduated from Harvard Law School in 1894, is a director
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:26.700]   of U.S. and British insurance companies, belongs to such swank Manhattan clubs as Union, Metropolitan
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:31.300]   (where he lives), and Century. When he filed his civil suit against the Chase Bank, he
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.740]   well knew he was inviting the government to prosecute. His argument in that suit will
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:41.020]   become his defense in the criminal action. To wit, 1. Congress has no constitutional
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.820]   power to delegate its legislative authority over gold to the President.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:49.640]   2. The President is prevented by the Fifth (due process of law) Amendment to the Constitution
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.140]   from depriving him of his property. The property in this case is not only the gold bars in
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:11:01.500]   the Chase vault, but his $65,000 paper profit, incident to the rise in gold from $20 to $31
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:06.460]   per ounce. Mr. Campbell, who promptly pleaded not guilty to the indictment and was released
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:11.300]   on $1,000 bail because no moral turpitude was involved in the charge, was thoroughly
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.280]   aware of the risks he was running in this contest with the government. If convicted,
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.680]   he could be disbarred, fined $10,000, imprisoned for 10 years. But he was, he intimated, making
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:28.160]   a fight for his constitutional rights and "if I have to go to jail, I don't care."
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:36.460]   And again, that was an article published in Time Magazine on October 9, 1933.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:41.400]   So the lessons stand, the points that I had planned to make, and it's interesting to
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:50.640]   read an article from the era with more details. The lesson is, if Mr. Campbell had diversified
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.720]   his holdings, and if he had moved quickly, he very likely could have kept his gold. Now
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.720]   I appreciate the fact that he was a man of means and a man of principle, ready to fight
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.800]   for the constitutionality of his ability to own his gold and not be stolen by the United
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:15.000]   States government. Of course, he lost. His gold was confiscated. He lost his case. The
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.960]   Supreme Court said, "Yes, President Roosevelt can make this action," and all of the money
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.080]   was gone. So we can see what happens sometimes when you stay and fight, even for things that
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.720]   seem like an obvious win. If the wins are against you, I mean, it's hard for me to
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.640]   believe if I presented the facts of that case to somebody in the modern era, I think most
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.480]   people would say, "Yeah, that's wrong. They shouldn't take his gold." And yet, the wins
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   of that era were against him. The thinking of the time was that he was doing something
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.680]   wrong and the president was saving the country. So it's wildly unpredictable to know what
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   the wins of the era tomorrow are going to be. So what could he have done? Well, he could
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.160]   have diversified his holdings. Now, in 1933, that was not as easy as it is today. He was
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.640]   a businessman doing business in New York, and the gold bars were a normal part of his
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:15.440]   settling his contracts. Again, as the story stated, he would take his gold certificates,
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.840]   which was a claim for gold, he would take his gold certificates to the US Treasury and
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.160]   he would get gold bars backing up his US gold certificates. That was the point, was that
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.800]   the gold was there backing up certificates. That was the point of having a gold-backed
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.920]   dollar at the time. And so he was clearly doing business in the United States. But hopefully,
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.960]   I don't know, but what we see is that if you're depending upon any one jurisdiction to protect
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:52.160]   you, you're doing poorly. If he had taken some of his gold and gotten in a car, gotten
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.520]   in a train, taken it to a bank in Canada and placed some of his gold into the vault of
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.680]   a Canadian bank in Toronto, very likely he would have been able to retain that gold.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.600]   Very likely there was a window in which he could have done that. He could have hired
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.360]   a courier. As soon as he got wind of the change coming, he could have perhaps hired a courier
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.280]   and said, "Please take these gold bars and take them and put them on deposit at a bank
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:23.400]   in Toronto." And that could have protected his gold. No ships, no planes necessary, just
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.560]   a train, a car. He could have done it. For whatever reason, he didn't. And the lesson
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:35.960]   is it didn't work out well for him. So let's you and I be more thoughtful. I think that
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   you should, if you're going to buy gold specifically, I think that your first, I don't know, half
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:48.240]   dozen ounces, 10,000, couple, 10, 20,000, maybe 10,000 per person, right? Some reasonable
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.480]   number. I don't have any exact science behind making up a number. But your first half dozen
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.280]   ounces or so should probably be held in some way, some place that you can get to them in
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.920]   case you need them. But if you're going to go with any serious amount of gold, then I
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:14.080]   think very likely that gold should be stored in an offshore jurisdiction, a separate country
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.280]   from where you live, and should be diversified if it gets to be significant amounts. If you've
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.680]   got thousands of ounces, then it should certainly be diversified. Hundreds certainly should
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:32.880]   be diversified. And so you want to choose your jurisdictions carefully. I think it's
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:39.680]   interesting that they cited the example of the Swiss finance corporation that was holding
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.480]   its gold in the United States. For the Swiss, it was unthinkable what the Americans did
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:50.000]   at that time. And so this is why the Swiss have had a long and storied history of banking,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.920]   because they have a high respect for your rights to bank. They've always had a high
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.080]   respect for privacy. Now, in the last years, much of that has changed. Even interesting
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   with the new set of Credit Suisse papers, the new leak, then maybe there will be more
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:13.600]   changes in the future. But the point stands that a jurisdiction that culturally will respect
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:22.720]   you, and I would say importantly, a jurisdiction that has strong interest to be in your camp,
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:30.480]   is a better jurisdiction than just a random country. Those are the basic lessons on gold.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:37.960]   Now let's pivot for a moment. What is the 21st century version of gold? I think gold
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:48.940]   still is powerful for reasons stated. But gold has downsides. It has certain attributes.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.720]   Some of those attributes make it wonderful, and some of those attributes don't make it
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:58.900]   wonderful. For example, the attribute that gold has of being physical makes it wonderful.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:03.780]   Being owned by the possessor of it makes it wonderful. As I stated, you can own the gold,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:08.440]   you can take a gold bar, walk out in your backyard, dig up a couple of feet of worth
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.720]   of dirt, stick it down and plant a tree over it, and you're done. Your gold is going to
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.180]   sit there. It's not going to call out to anybody that it's there, unless you're being specifically
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:23.480]   targeted with a metal detector. There you can engage in some more interesting ways of
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:31.600]   concealing it. There's nothing really required. It's an ordinary person's ability to take
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.240]   care of it and to engage in privacy. The problem is it's physical. So what if you're trying
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:43.280]   to flee from a war-torn country? Your neighbor has just invaded with tanks and bombs, and
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.420]   you have to flee and you need access to your money. And all of a sudden, the global finance
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.980]   system is being disrupted and banks are being shuttered. And you thought you were being
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:57.160]   smart because you kept your money in a foreign bank, right? Following Joshua's internationalization
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.440]   advice, you kept your money in a foreign bank just across the border, a bigger country that
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.720]   had more reason to think that it was going to be useful for you. Then all of a sudden,
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.720]   that bank is basically cut off from the world banking system. And now what do you do? This
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:18.120]   is where people have wanted for a long time some form of digital gold. And this is where
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:26.080]   in the modern age, potentially, we have that. Potentially with Bitcoin. Now we're very early
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:34.280]   in the life cycle of Bitcoin. And I'm going to be inclusive, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:40.360]   Bitcoin maximalists don't like it to be inclusive, but I choose to be inclusive. We're very early
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:46.160]   in the testing process of this. But early indications are that this is a very useful
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.560]   thing. So could the same thing apply? Well, I think there are very good reasons for you
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:01.960]   to be concerned about future legislation that reflects things like Executive Order 6102.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.200]   I think there are very good reasons for you to be concerned about that. So what do you
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.680]   do? Well, I think you apply the same caution and care in your ownership, your acquisition
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:22.520]   of Bitcoin or other currencies as you would to gold. Notice at the time, from that Time
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:30.640]   article that the US government maintained a list of people who were known, what they
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.160]   called gold hoarders, people who owned gold. Well, similar lists are being created right
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:43.920]   now. Last year on your US tax return, the US government asked you to declare whether
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.520]   you owned any cryptocurrencies. And your choice of what to put on that box was a very momentous
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:56.760]   one. It started the creation of a list, started the creation of data that can be used to prosecute
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:03.600]   you. Now, I recommend you answer it truthfully. I don't play around with people that can put
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:11.680]   me in prison. I don't play around with people that can take away my freedom. But there is
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.320]   a lot you can do to protect against things getting worse. And all of it starts at the
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:23.920]   very beginning. If you had not been registered as a known gold hoarder, again, at that time
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.240]   it was much easier because you could just have gold, gold coins, etc. But you had had
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:36.600]   your family collection of gold and it was not registered, insured, etc. You were pretty
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.200]   well safe just to sit on it. And there was an immediate profit for you. Now, I'm not
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.880]   sure that was the best trade because you couldn't publicly sell it for several decades. But
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.720]   at least it would have been there for you. At least it would have been there able for
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:21:00.760]   you to do business with. So, it's an extremely valuable thing for you to have had. And I
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:08.480]   want to encourage you as you are building other assets, I want to encourage you to make
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:16.400]   sure that you purchase other assets with the same basic thing in mind. And here I want
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:22.760]   to introduce you to my newest course. This is a joint project with Gabriel Custodiat,
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:30.440]   author of the Watchman's Guide to Privacy. Gabriel is a privacy consultant, privacy expert,
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.800]   and we've been working on this for a while to build a course. And it's basically the
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:40.920]   course that I wanted for me about how to buy Bitcoin privately. The genesis of the course
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.480]   is exactly what I said. I was talking to Gabriel. I've become friendly with him over time. And
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.520]   as we've talked about different things, I've gone back and forth and I've given him some
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:54.680]   of my privacy questions, some of my privacy comments, made various suggestions to him.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.560]   And along the way I said, "Listen, here's something I'm working on. I would really like
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:03.480]   to understand how to buy Bitcoin privately." And I outlined for him the reasons, which
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:09.440]   I basically just stated. And I said, "How can I do this? Because it's more difficult
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.520]   than you might think. What are the technologies? How do I do it?" We're living in a world where
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:22.400]   the Bitcoin marketplace is a mixture of different things. But to actually own Bitcoin privately,
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.440]   to have it, to create it privately and to own it without there being a paper trail is
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.960]   more challenging than I wish it were. So here is the new course that we have created. The
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:39.360]   course is called Private Cryptocurrencies, How to Buy, Own, and Use Bitcoin Like a True
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.040]   Radical. Imagine this, your bank accounts are frozen. You must flee the country with
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.280]   only what you carry. Gold is suspicious and cash has limits. You cross the world, find
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:57.260]   a public computer, download a single program and type from memory a private key. You now
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:03.680]   have access to $2 million worth of Bitcoin unattached to your identity, tucked away for
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.520]   just this scenario and the knowledge to buy, trade and convert it into any local currency
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:16.320]   in the world. Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate exit strategy for inflation, social collapse
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:22.280]   and other disasters. But only if you acquire and use them correctly, which 99% of people
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:28.640]   fail to do. In this two-part course, privacy consultant Gabriel Custodiat explains step-by-step
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.240]   multiple ways to legally buy Bitcoin with no attachment to personal information. He
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.300]   then explains how to use it, how to protect it and how to convert it to other crypto for
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:42.640]   speculation or added privacy. The course includes everything you need to understand this process
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.300]   from A to Z, no prior knowledge required. As authorities crack down on cryptocurrencies,
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:53.040]   it is critical to have up-to-date, tested methods for private Bitcoin. There is much
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.540]   confusion about this process. The aim of this course is to give you all of the information
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:02.080]   you need with minimal diversion, no confusing tech vocabulary, no moralizing, no hacker-level
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.640]   computer skills, only the focused steps to teach you how to make the most radical personal
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.120]   financial decision of your life.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:16.120]   That's the dream. That's the idea. So basically what we're doing is we are doing this in the
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:22.160]   form of a live webinar for this initial class. We have at least about four hours of content.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:28.520]   We're going to do two live webinars with live Q&A. We've worked out the outlines and also
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.840]   there's a couple of bonuses. So details of that on the course page. I'll let you check
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.280]   that out. But we're going to basically teach you how to do that. That's been my dream for
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.840]   a long time.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:44.280]   When you look at finances, and again I'll be talking more about this in days to come
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:53.720]   and other episodes more focused, but when you look at finances, in our modern era it's
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.240]   almost a human right to say, "I must be able to have control of my money." And yet we're
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.520]   living in a system, "I must be able to do business." We're living in a system where
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:18.160]   that control has been intensely centralized. And this is a great, great risk. Bitcoin offers
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:27.920]   the potential for us to do better. And so what we outlined in the promotion there is
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:33.240]   exactly what my dream has been. Imagine that you go across a border with nothing other
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.400]   than a seed phrase in your head. And you go and you find a computer and boom, you've got
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.760]   access to your money regardless of what's happening. And that's money that's never
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.560]   been tied to you, is never connected to you, etc. But it allows you to do business and
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.240]   to make it and live it.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.160]   So if that sounds interesting to you, I'd love you to check it out. Here's the URL you
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:06.400]   need. BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com. Go to BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com now and buy access. And we look forward to
