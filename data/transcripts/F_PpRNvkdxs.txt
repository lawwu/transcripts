[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   When I think of a credit card, I think there's really three reasons that I might want to have
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.000]   a credit card. And one of them is probably the obvious one most people think of. And that's
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.020]   because it earns a lot of points or cash back on categories I spend in. If you spend a lot of
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.340]   money on dining, having a card that rewards you for that dining. If you spend a lot of money on
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.180]   groceries, same thing. Or if you just spend a lot of money that doesn't fall into a specific
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.180]   category, having a card that rewards your everyday spending, whatever category that is,
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.580]   there are a lot of categories where there aren't cards for bonuses. So that could be
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.720]   another one. So that's one reason to have a card.
