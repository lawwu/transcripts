[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   We have now received almost 100 email questions from our listeners related to the very sobering
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.120]   question of Christians, suicide, and salvation.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.480]   Several recent emails related to the suicides of pastors have come in.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400]   Andrew, a regular podcast listener from Ankeny, Iowa writes in, "Pastor John, recently the
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.640]   family pastor at a local church committed suicide.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   So what happens to the soul of a professing born-again believer who commits suicide?
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.320]   Is this the unforgivable sin?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.640]   Does this show that the person was never actually a believer because he did not persevere?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.880]   Or is it possible for someone that commits suicide to still go to heaven?"
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.960]   So Pastor John, these are hard questions, but they are not new questions to you.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.240]   I have been involved closely in several suicides in my life.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.120]   I cleaned up the basement after the police removed the body of a man who shot himself
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.960]   in the head, and I used a broom to sweep the blood and the stuff into a dustpan and pour
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.320]   it down the laundry sink so his wife would not have to see what we found.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.160]   And then I did his funeral five days later.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.240]   He was a professing believer.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.680]   I've done a funeral for a young woman who leaped from the window of the locked ward
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.360]   at the hospital down the street from my house where she was being safely kept in her psychological
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.800]   distress and she died by jumping out of the window.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.440]   So let's be clear now.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.760]   Self-murder is serious.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.720]   We are playing with fire here.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.280]   It is spiritually and eternally serious to murder yourself.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.660]   It is not a light thing.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.680]   And anyone listening to me now who is contemplating suicide should hear me say, "Don't do it.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.240]   There is a better way.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.900]   I promise you in the name of Jesus Christ, there is a better way."
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.120]   You don't feel that, perhaps, right now, but your feelings are not true.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.400]   They're deceiving you.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.320]   It is true that God has another way for you.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.080]   He always makes another way.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.040]   Wait for him and seek the help you need because the Bible is very serious about talking of
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   murder.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.400]   Everyone, this is 1 John 3, 15, "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.760]   And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.960]   Now that should scare the wits out of people who are contemplating ending their life with
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.240]   murder.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.120]   So what does that mean?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.600]   Eternal life and murder don't go in the same soul.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920]   But let's be careful now.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.000]   Let's not take this farther than it leads.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.800]   Does he mean that everyone who has a moment of hate is a hateful person?
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.840]   Probably not.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.280]   Does he mean that everyone who has a murderous moment is a murderer?
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   That's an important question.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.040]   I doubt it.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.160]   Yes, the Bible says we must persevere to the end in order to be saved.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   Mark 13, 13.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.360]   Or Hebrews 3, 14, "We have come to share in Christ if we hold our confidence firm to
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   the end."
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.840]   That's a very serious warning.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:55.600]   But it does not mean that our experience of confidence in God to the end is perfect so
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.840]   that we don't have lapses of sin which betray that we're not fully trusting Christ.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.040]   All sin, all my sin, the sin that I do this afternoon, tomorrow, yesterday, is all rooted
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.920]   in some level of distrust in the superior goodness of God.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.600]   And I don't go in and out of being a Christian when I sin and that measure of distrust becomes
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.000]   manifest in sinning.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.440]   I don't cease to be a Christian.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.040]   So saying that we must persevere to the end in confidence doesn't mean that you must persevere
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   to the end in sinlessness or perfect trust in Christ.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.360]   There is imperfection in our trust.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:53.960]   So the question now is, whether a person who commits suicide goes to heaven, that question
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   boils down to this.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.480]   If a person has been trusting in Christ as their Savior, their Lord, their treasure,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:13.840]   does the last act of their life prove the decisive one in showing their true standing
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   as a child of God?
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.960]   There's the key question.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:26.600]   Does the last act, in their case murder, count as the decisive one at the judgment day in
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.120]   showing that we were in Christ or not?
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.600]   Is the last act the one that determines if our faith was real?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.920]   Or do all the other acts of life count as evidence as well?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.480]   Let me give you an analogy.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.840]   This has helped many people as I've shared it.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   I hope it helps.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.000]   Suppose that I, one night, let's just say right now, 68 years old, could have been at
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.560]   any point, get so angry at my wife that I storm out of the house.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   I slam the door.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:15.720]   I jump in the car and I head for the road and I am so out of control and so angry, so
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.160]   sinful, let me add, so sinfully angry that I totally misjudge one of these narrow turns
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.840]   here where the telephone poles are about two feet off the road and I smash into that telephone
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.160]   pole going 60 miles an hour and I am dead.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:43.960]   Now my last act was sin and I killed myself by my sin.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.200]   I didn't intend to kill myself, but I did.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.240]   And it was sin that made it happen.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.280]   So the last thing I did was sin.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.400]   Is that last sin decisive in determining whether John Piper was born again?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.800]   And my answer is, not necessarily.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   In other words, God will look at my life.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.560]   He will look at my whole life.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.760]   And the evidences of whether I belong to him will be assessed not because of that failure
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.400]   alone, any more than any other failure alone.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.360]   Why would the last one be decisive when the others are just as serious?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.460]   So the last question then becomes this.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.960]   Can a Christian be so depressed and temporarily blinded to the hope of the gospel that he
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.520]   takes his life in a temporary moment of despair?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.320]   And I think the answer to that is yes.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:56.200]   Now that's a judgment call on my part to say that seasons of darkness come and go in the
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.320]   Christian life.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:05.880]   It is dangerous to say this because we're all so easily deceived and we should be terrified
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.200]   to try to meet Jesus by means of murder.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.440]   That is a horrible choice.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:20.880]   But between that terror that we should feel about that choice and the hopelessness for
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.760]   the victim of suicide, between those two, I'm waving a flag of hope that true faith
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.400]   can have a season that dark.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.580]   That is very sobering.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.820]   And I appreciate you sharing your experience and your pastoral wisdom and thinking through
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.600]   the many related questions that come out on this issue, Pastor John.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.800]   These are the types of serious and sober questions we get and try to address on the podcast.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.080]   And for more books and articles and sermons from John Piper, please go to DesiringGod.org.

[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.080]   We'll be back tomorrow on a happier note to talk about the discipline of singing to the
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   Lord alone.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.280]   It's an important part of the spiritual life and we will be back tomorrow to address it.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.840]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
