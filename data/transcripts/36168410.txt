[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.360]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm glad to spend some time today with you as we encourage
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.240]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.540]   Now, whether you are just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the daily delight
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.180]   of family learning, I think you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.180]   So don't forget that although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.960]   support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.520]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.720]   All right, listeners, here we are creeping ever closer to the end of our academic year.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.960]   For many of us, community days are coming to a close.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.620]   And I know that there are some foundations communities that have already had their last hurrah.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.320]   Their celebration, their faces of history, their awards and goodbye ceremonies, and a lot of
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.380]   our challenge students are still plugging away, working on those last minute projects and those
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.380]   last papers and mock trial and senior thesis and all that good stuff.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.700]   But I know that for many of us, the end of the year also means that we are looking at assessing
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900]   our students.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.400]   Some of our students, especially our challenge students, are experiencing blue book exams.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.820]   And some of them, for the very first time, are doing what we call blue book exams.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.480]   Some of them are a little freaked out and some of their parents are a little worried, too.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.560]   So I have with me a dear friend, fellow homeschool educator, Emily Martin.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   Emily, thank you for joining us today.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.280]   Thank you for having me, Lisa.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.700]   Emily and I have a little bit of experience taking our own children through the assessment process,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.120]   but also shepherding other families and challenge students through the blue book process.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.320]   So I thought we would just debunk some myths for some people and spread a little good cheer
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.480]   and encouragement for all of us.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.300]   So Emily is going to help me answer some questions.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.880]   Now, listen.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.460]   Even though your young children may not be involved in blue book exams, many of you are
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.460]   concerned about assessment or taking stock at the end of the year.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.180]   So we're going to talk about that, too.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.280]   So this podcast is not just for junior high and high school students who are taking blue
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.260]   book exams, but for everybody.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.820]   OK, so let me let me ask you this first, Emily, so people can get to know you and your
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.380]   experience.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.300]   How did you feel about taking tests when you were a student?
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.340]   I was one of those that had maybe a little bit of test anxiety.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.860]   I did not.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.480]   I did not enjoy taking tests.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.120]   And I would have to study hard to even feel like I knew a little bit of what I was doing.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.840]   Right.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.900]   And I remember the first time I took a test and I sat down and I looked at it and I thought,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.740]   I actually know the answers to this.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.860]   I was in college.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.340]   I was in my sophomore year of college.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.620]   So I just was not one of those great test takers.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.340]   And so I never, never enjoyed it.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.000]   You know what?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.960]   A lot of people say that.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.820]   I know I've met lots of students who are great learners.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.220]   You know, they read, they absorb information, they participate in class, they enjoy the give
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.560]   and take, the wrestling with a good idea.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.740]   They don't perform really well on tests.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.940]   So a lot of people aren't good test takers.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.080]   And there are skills involved in test taking.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.700]   And that may be something, parents, that you are interested in giving your children more practice with.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.660]   Homeschoolers are notoriously low on formal testing.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:53.040]   So maybe the truth is our students don't have as much practice taking tests and taking different kinds of tests.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   So there's nothing to say that we can't give our students tests as fun, as games, as practice.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.960]   Not that we're going to score them and keep that as a record, as a mark for or against them, but giving them opportunities to play around with tests.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.780]   So maybe they're not as nervous as many of us were.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.700]   Right.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.180]   And I was one of those that I, to answer factual was difficult.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.960]   And I preferred an open-ended question so that the teacher would know.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.360]   Like, oh, okay.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.780]   She knows what she's talking about.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.560]   I always preferred those versus the matching or fill in the blank.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.940]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.700]   And I hated what I used to call multiple guess test.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:45.260]   The multiple choice where, you know, there were four answers and three of them were sort of close to right.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.180]   And it was just really hard.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:56.940]   That seemed like, to me, as a student, that seemed more like a test designed to trick me than to help me remember
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.320]   and put together all the stuff I had learned.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.400]   So I didn't like those either.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.080]   I much preferred short answer or essay so I could tell all the things I knew.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.540]   And then you decide, teacher, if that's enough.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.480]   Exactly.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.500]   I like that.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.460]   So we talked about test.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   But I want to explore with you, Emily, a little bit.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.660]   What do you think is the difference between a test and an assessment?
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.660]   So I think I looked up the definitions of both test and assessment.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.980]   And they are really quite similar.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.680]   Yep.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.240]   I think where they differ is the connotation.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:44.420]   So a test is like that multiple choice, the fill in the blank, where there is a black and white, you know, get right or wrong answer.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.840]   This is the answer.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.600]   So you think about a medical test, right?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.960]   You're either positive or negative.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.520]   Right.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.920]   Whereas assessment, you're trying to get the big picture.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   Ooh, that is a lovely difference.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.300]   So talk about that.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.040]   So like my daughter does dance, right?
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.660]   And she's really wanting to go on point.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.460]   Well, her dance instructor is going to have to assess her to see whether she's developed enough.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.680]   So that doesn't mean there's a right or wrong way of doing it.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.240]   It just means, are you ready?
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.140]   Yes.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.140]   Versus like an assessment.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.180]   Like when you have a situation, you're like, well, let me assess the situation.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.380]   There's no black or white yes or no.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.640]   It's more gathering information.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.720]   Yes.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.820]   I absolutely love that.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.840]   Listeners, I hope you'll wind back because that's kind of a profound difference.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.580]   With a test, you're looking for a black or white answer, yes or no.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.680]   Did you, student, land on what I, teacher, thought was the right answer?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.480]   Right.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.200]   Versus, yeah, the assessment is tell me what you know.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.360]   Let's look at the big picture and let's dive into those ideas.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.720]   Yes.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.860]   And I think an assessment can involve not just what all you know, but how much more do you
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.480]   know than when we started?
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:19.640]   So let's assess our progress even more than let's assess, do you have a big enough body of
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.960]   knowledge on this subject for me, your parents feel good about?
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.900]   I love, I like that with, in relationship to our Challenge A students, very first day of Challenge
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.360]   A, they are told, you are going to, by the end of this year, learn to draw the world.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.500]   And their eyes get really big.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.300]   And so what a lot of Challenge A tutors do is they'll hand them a blank piece of paper and say,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.020]   okay, draw the world as you know it today.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.440]   And they are, it's, it's rough, you know, it's, it's not a pretty picture.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.820]   And then at the very last day for their Blue Book assessment, they are said, they're told,
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.960]   draw the world.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.000]   And the difference is astounding.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.300]   And I think that's a great picture of the overall assessment for the year.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.940]   It's like, look how much you learned.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.160]   Right.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:18.360]   Look how much better you are at spatial recognition and spatial organization.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:25.780]   I can remember when my own girls got to Challenge A and they had to do that the first time.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.780]   You know, I mean, some of the countries that were supposed to be big were small.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.540]   And some of the countries that were supposed to be close to another were actually not that
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.800]   close to that other country.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.000]   And some of the oceans were too big.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.700]   But you're right.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:50.600]   The assessment is, how have you grown in your ability to think deeper thoughts or to put more
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:58.520]   things together or to employ this skill in a more polished way?
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.760]   I love that.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:07.700]   And I do think, well, like I said before, that homeschoolers tend not to test.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.740]   And I understand that.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:20.540]   I think that some of us actually drag our feet on assessing also because we have such a negative
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:27.320]   connotation and because we have always made those the same testing and assessing the same.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:36.620]   So even when those of us who lived the testing life as students and became the, came to the
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.900]   assessing life as homeschool parents, we still have a little bit of a stumbling block, I think.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:50.980]   Yeah, I think that we can learn to assess better and make that a little more joyful.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.760]   And let me ask you this.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.180]   Okay.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.680]   I ask all my guests pointed questions.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.280]   And so usually it's people that I know, and I know you won't mind answering honestly.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.960]   And I always tell people, I want you to tell the real truth, not, you know, what you think
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.220]   the prescribed answer should be because there are no prescribed answers here.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.580]   So here's the thing I want to know, Emily.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.200]   Do you do assessments every year with your kids at home?
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.240]   So yes and no.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.860]   When I have challenged students now.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.400]   And so my challenge, my oldest is finishing up challenge one.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.500]   So this is the third year we have done formal assessment as far as a blue book.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.460]   Okay.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.080]   Assessment.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.600]   Okay.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.940]   And so that is one way that it's kind of built into the CC program is that end of the
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.480]   year assessment.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.260]   So that has been done.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.240]   My other two have gone through foundations.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.160]   And so there's the memory master in the end.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.640]   And there's the faces of history, which acts, you know, very much like an end of the year
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.300]   assessment.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.500]   But we're also a military family, which means for the past six years, we've lived in four
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.340]   different states.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:08.820]   Wow.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.580]   And every state has their own type of assessment, requirements, laws and requirements.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.960]   So some states, such as Florida, you had to either do a standardized test at the end of
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.180]   every year or you had to have your portfolio checkboxed by a certified teacher.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.460]   And so I chose to do this standardized assessment with my students.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.000]   In Georgia, it was once every three years.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.240]   So we were only there for two.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.140]   So I opted to not do formal assessment that year.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:47.880]   And so, you know, I think it depends on, for one thing, I think your homeschool goal as a
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.620]   family, whether or not you decide to assess the laws of the state in which you live, the
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.660]   age of your students.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:00.880]   If you have a six-year-old, you know, maybe just, you know, it may not be as academically
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.960]   important to have like a formal assessment at the end of every year versus your 11th grader
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.520]   who is filling out college applications and they need to turn in a piece of paper.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.340]   So I think it varies.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.920]   But me personally, it just depends on the year and where we live at the time.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.220]   And so with my challenge students, you know, we, you know, we'll do the end of the year
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.020]   blue book assessment as our formal assessment.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.260]   Right, right.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.800]   I think that's really good.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:36.820]   And I'm glad that, that our listeners can hear that there is, as always, freedom in the way that
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.100]   you're homeschooling your children.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.400]   You are right.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.140]   Every state has their own requirements.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:49.080]   Here in North Carolina, you are supposed to take and turn in the score of a standardized test
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.160]   for each student every year.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.620]   As far as I've ever been able to determine, there's no prescribed score and nothing.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:03.180]   I'm not completely sure that anybody ever looks at these scores, but anyway, we did them.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:11.500]   But I love what you said about it being somewhat dependent on the age of your child.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:22.980]   I know when my children were in challenge, there were blue books at the end of the year to assess
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.800]   the progress that the students had made.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:33.140]   But I know that in those early years, we didn't do beyond that formal standardized test.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.200]   We didn't do a formal assessment.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.580]   But I did, I remember sitting down with them.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.620]   Now, maybe not when they were six, but as they got a little older, sitting down with them
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:52.300]   and asking questions to assess how successful our year was together.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:58.020]   Like asking them, you know, what project did you like to do the most?
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:04.960]   What, which of the strands, which of the memory work strands was the easiest for you?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.600]   Which was the hardest?
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.920]   Why do you think it was hard?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.220]   What were you most interested in reading about after we studied it together?
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.420]   You know, just to see how their interest changed during the year.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.580]   It was really interesting to me that sometimes the thing they thought they were going to love
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.720]   the most at the beginning of the year is not what they loved the most.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:36.380]   And sometimes the things that they avoided at the beginning, they really enjoyed as we got
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:36.960]   into it.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.160]   So those are the kinds of informal assessments that I think all of us can do.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.680]   And it helps our children have a hand in that assessment.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.520]   When I'm reading with my daughter, who's still, you know, foundations and essentials age,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.560]   we'll read a book together, you know.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:03.820]   And so I'll say, hey, do you remember when, you know, three months ago you struggled reading
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.480]   this book?
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.680]   And now look, you can do this now.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.020]   And so, so that's kind of, you know, like her doing a self-assessment, me prompting her
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.020]   self-assess and say, look, look at your growth.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.420]   Let's remember where you struggled and now look what you can do.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.680]   Oh, Emily, that's beautiful.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:28.620]   And I think parents, even if your children are doing blue books in community, it is wise
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.160]   to have an assessment time, an assessment conversation with your older students.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:42.080]   And the questions get a little more heart intrusive at that point.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.620]   I mean, I remember asking my girls, do you think you have done your best?
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:56.240]   You know, we would talk about maybe strands that were more of a struggle for them.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.920]   And I would say, do you think, was that your best?
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.780]   Because if that was your best, if you honestly feel like you worked as hard as you could to
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.800]   achieve what you did, whatever you learned in this year was an excellent effort.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.400]   And we are happy with that.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.380]   But, you know, it teaches them, too, to assess their own efforts.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:27.400]   If they know they didn't really try very hard or they skated through on some base knowledge
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.260]   of something they just happen to be good at naturally or that they like, that becomes a
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:40.100]   character issue that, as parents, we can use assessment time to probe also.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.160]   I like to ask my students, what is something you did really well this year?
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.380]   And how can you improve?
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.740]   And what ways can you improve for next year?
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.280]   What would you like to try harder at doing?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.340]   And it's amazing.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:18:02.320]   I don't think our teenagers naturally self-assess or naturally think about those things.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.240]   So you have to prompt them to think about it.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:13.100]   And they often, I would say, nine times out of ten, when I ask them those questions, they
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:19.160]   identify the things that I saw as well, things that they did well or things that maybe just
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.580]   wasn't their best this year.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.860]   So they know, but you just have to prompt them to think about it.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.960]   I think that's good.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.500]   I think it's a good looking back and looking forward is a beautiful part of assessment like
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.880]   you brought up.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.260]   Um, so how long have you directed, Emily?
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.120]   How long have you directed in community?
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.820]   Um, so I did two years as a foundations tutor and I am finishing up my third year directing
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.540]   challenge.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:52.000]   So you have a fair amount of experience with assessing within the community.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:02.380]   How have you practiced assessment in class with your students and have you changed as you have
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:02.740]   grown?
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.360]   Because here's the truth.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.780]   We all are continuing to grow.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:14.920]   I'm a much better assessor than I was 10 years ago because I've learned and I've grown and
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.560]   I've seen that some of the things I thought were important are not really important.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.300]   And some of the things I was leaving out are the things I need to bring up.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.120]   So how have you changed as an assessor?
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.600]   So, um, I am a product of public education.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.740]   My degree was elementary ed.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.260]   So, um, I'm very, you know, my, when I first started homeschooling, that was very much my
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:38.800]   mindset.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.640]   You're like, let's do unit studies.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.620]   And I wanted to do school at home versus homeschool, which is really different.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.100]   Um, so my first year directing challenge, uh, like, okay, you have to write a blue book.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.400]   Okay, great.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.320]   I can do this.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.600]   And, and instead of doing what I should have done and looking in the back of the guide to
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:05.620]   find great blue book, uh, questions and prompts, I, uh, scoured the internet and I made
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:13.500]   up a great test and it was matching and fill in the blank, but I kept trying to tell my
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.380]   students, it's a celebration of what you've learned, but they were very black and white,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.760]   right and wrong answers.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.020]   Right.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.980]   It did not feel celebratory to them.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.280]   I bet.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.340]   It was not celebratory.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.160]   It was very stressful.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:33.120]   And, and then I decided to go through the classical learning cohort, which is really a fantastic,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.200]   uh, class program that CC offers for parents to go through.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.420]   And we learn a lot about assessment and what are good assessment questions.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:48.080]   And so that started my journey of thinking more classically.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.240]   Uh, and then through more, more reading and, uh, listening to some of your other wonderful
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:59.940]   podcast guests and articles on the CC blog that transformed my thinking into, wait, what is
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.920]   more classical?
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.100]   How, how can you assess more classically?
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:10.700]   And that's where, um, just this year I, I learned what a classical assessment looks like.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.020]   And so when, uh, our director at our current community, you challenge a director, it's her
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.920]   first time going through.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.960]   She's like, Emily, can I see your blue book for challenge A?
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.460]   I'm like, great.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.740]   I'll send it to you.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.020]   And I opened it to read through it.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.960]   I messaged her back.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.440]   I'm not sending you this.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.140]   This is not it.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.920]   I failed this.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.180]   I was like, no, you are not getting this.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.560]   I will, I will help you formulate some prompts for your students, but you are not getting this.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.580]   Oh, isn't that, that's so beautiful.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:48.200]   And so honest, I mean, we as parents are still growing in our understanding of how to shepherd
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.040]   the educations of our children.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.580]   And if we're not changing and growing, then probably something's wrong because we don't
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.640]   all, all know everything.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.740]   We don't know all the things that we, we ought to be learning.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.940]   So give, give me a couple of, um, examples.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   We're going to talk about blue books, parents, listeners, I promise we're going to talk specifically
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:17.500]   about blue books, but Emily, give, give the listeners an example of what a classical prompt
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.800]   might be.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:27.660]   So, uh, one of my favorite things to do when I am prompting my students, um, is really for
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.840]   one thing, ask a lot about the exposition strand, which is our literature.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.040]   And it's, uh, things like, you know, choose two or more characters and compare, uh, their
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.380]   similarities and differences in choices they made.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:47.400]   Ooh, uh, or, um, if it's a debate strand, uh, particularly like for challenge one, right
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.780]   now we're discussing economics.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:54.520]   So tell me about what you have learned about inflation this year and how does that relate
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.200]   to our economy and how has it related to our economy throughout history?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:06.000]   Uh, and so then they can, they can tally in their American history, but they've learned
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.460]   in the beginning of the year, all the way through like the economics discussion, because we talk
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.340]   about all of that.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:19.580]   And, um, and I think it's important, especially for our tutors to, um, make sure you're at,
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:25.360]   you're, you're formulating your assessment questions based on what you have discussed in community.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.040]   Right.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.400]   Versus, cause there are a lot of great questions out there, but if you're, if it's not something
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.020]   you've discussed, your students may not really know how to answer.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.800]   Well, they may not know how to integrate it with the other things.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.660]   And that's truly, I love what you were saying.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.960]   I picked up on something that some of our listeners may have picked up on.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:54.720]   You are formulating these questions, these prompts using some of the 15 skills that we are sharpening
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.020]   as parents and as students in our reading and in our studying.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.440]   So I, I saw, I heard, um, relationship and definition and comparison in those examples
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.280]   that you gave.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:14.020]   So those would be, um, if we just, as parents, if we thought, well, how do I come up with a
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.940]   classical prompt?
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.340]   If we keep those skills in mind, that's a great start.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.540]   Exactly.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.760]   Um, so I think it's, it's more, um, and I think maybe the most basic way to explain
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.340]   a classical assessment versus, you know, a, uh, formative test in like the public school
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.320]   system is they're more open-ended.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.560]   It's more.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.500]   Tell me about what you know.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.260]   Tell me about what you know.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.240]   And there are, it does get a little fuzzy, especially when you're talking about Latin,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:49.720]   right?
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.980]   I mean, you do have to, there are some things you need to know.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.820]   Yes.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.960]   That don't change.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.520]   That aren't a matter of opinion.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.820]   Right.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.260]   Exactly.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:05.240]   Such as, uh, let's write out the endings for the five declensions, you know, but you may
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.100]   not know every single one, but you certainly know a lot more of them from when you started.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.860]   Right.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.220]   And maybe you have keys to figuring out based on some of the other questions.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.660]   Maybe you know enough to recognize it when you see it.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.560]   Exactly.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.380]   Or let's translate this sentence and tell me what you know about this sentence in English
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.020]   and Latin.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.160]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.240]   Okay.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.540]   So I want to be sure that we answer.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.580]   Cause I know that some parent came on here because it was, it was called blue books.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.340]   They're coming in here wanting to know what is a blue book exam.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.940]   I never had a blue book exam until I was in college.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.620]   I didn't know what in the world that was.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:54.880]   And they were, by the way, mostly very much more like a test than an assessment.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.200]   Although I will, I was a political science major, um, and a philosophy minor.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.800]   And so a lot of them were, I mean, essay questions, but, but they still felt more like a test than
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.480]   an assessment.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.520]   What is a blue book and why in the world do we call it a blue book?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.660]   So quick story.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:22.360]   I, uh, I brought my boys, one of my daughter to, um, my old college last weekend.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.260]   Oh, cool.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.580]   And I was like, Hey guys, let's go through the bookstore just for fun.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:33.000]   No offense to this higher learning facility, but, um, there were zero books in the bookstore
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.080]   that we could see.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:43.260]   It was t-shirts and mugs and things, but they did have a rack in their school supply section
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.580]   and stacked up were blue books, blue books, like a dollar 75.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.820]   And I was like, Hey guys, look at this.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.020]   That's a blue book.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.540]   So it is literally a blue book.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:00.480]   Yes, it is a blind paper with a blue sheet of paper on top of it.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.420]   And it says blue book and a place for your name.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.180]   And that's it.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.380]   That's why they call them blue books because they're covered in blue paper and it's just
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.540]   a notebook stapled together.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:15.540]   Um, but how we use it in CC challenge is, you know, we have our students give them a list
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.660]   of prompts to answer based on every strand and tell me what you know.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:28.900]   So what should our students know as they're coming in to these last weeks and, you know,
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:35.440]   in community, you are likely beginning to talk about as you prepare for the blue book final
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.140]   or for the blue book exam, what should students know about blue books?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.640]   So I think, uh, a thought just came to me, um, and I want to touch on real quick.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.960]   And then I'll answer that is I, for parents, more of the formal assessment happens throughout
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.520]   the year.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.120]   It's, um, the math, you know, if they're still going through Saxon, some of our older challenge
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.080]   students are still going through the Saxon level math.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.880]   Um, what are their, what are their grades on their math?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.660]   They're writing their essays.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.340]   Okay.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.160]   Did you, did you knock off all these things that you need to do for your essays?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.320]   Is the grammar correct?
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.420]   Is the spelling correct?
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.320]   Did you, uh, is your thesis well-formed?
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.860]   That's your formal assessment.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.620]   Um, again, if they're doing the apology of sciences throughout our upper level challenge,
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.180]   they have those study guides, the test.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.420]   Those are the formal assessments that your student will get throughout the year because
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.160]   they, at the end of the day, they do need to have a transcript, right?
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.060]   Uh, if they're going into, yeah.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:42.900]   And you want to be sure the incremental learning is happening, that there's not, you, that you
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.880]   didn't miss a step that's going to cause you to stumble later on.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.540]   Exactly.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:53.420]   So the formal assessment that, you know, they, you need, if a parent chooses to do the form,
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.000]   you know, more of a formal assessment that is generally happening throughout the course
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.900]   of the academic year.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:07.040]   Now the blue book for the students is the opportunity to spew your thoughts and ideas
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.620]   that you have on these topics at the end of the year, uh, or mid-semester.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.260]   We do one, you know, in the, we do at the end of the fall and the end of spring.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:21.620]   So it's tell your parent and tell your director all your thoughts and ideas on this topic.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.060]   There is no wrong answer.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.740]   I did have one caveat for some of my students that were.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.700]   Less academically astute.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.940]   You will have to give me more than one sentence.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.180]   Right.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.280]   You do not have to fill the entire blue book, but it needs to be more than a page.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.380]   And I need more than, I don't know.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.660]   Right.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:43.960]   Yes.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.100]   And not in big writing.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.240]   Don't try to fill it up.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.960]   I'm writing twice as big.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.180]   Yes.
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.760]   We know all of those tricks.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.360]   It's like, I want complete sentences.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.660]   Give me your ideas.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.700]   I know you are.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:54.900]   Sure.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.340]   Okay.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.440]   Okay.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.220]   So you've, but you've hit on some really good things.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:06.140]   Um, it is, the students need to know that it's an opportunity for them to think deeply
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.240]   about what you've discussed in class and connect things.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:18.380]   It's also a time for them to carefully, um, communicate.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.060]   They have been practicing clear communication.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:31.040]   And so it is important that they use full sentences, that they kind of pay attention to paragraphs
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.320]   and topic sentences and theses and, and punctuation.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:42.240]   And it is, it, it's an opportunity for you to be creative and sharing what you know, but
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.300]   you still need to follow.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.480]   It's a formal, it's a form.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.980]   And so you want to be sure that you are taking it seriously enough to do a good job.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.500]   And it's really interesting if you have a student moving up through the challenge levels to save
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.680]   those blue books too.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.300]   Yes.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.360]   And to go back and look, say, look how well you did, you know, here you're, you're, you
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.180]   were on the right track.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.960]   But then by the time they move up into the challenge levels, they have some really great responses
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.800]   to these blue book prompts.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:23.940]   I love watching, um, the thought process develop and, and I loved watching it in my own girls.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:32.000]   They became, um, better and better at pulling in more strands, um, tying together.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.260]   It's like, I remember telling, going upstairs one day and telling my husband, this really does
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.800]   work.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.180]   This is amazing.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:46.560]   They are really able to see the connections between things that on the surface have no
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   connection, but because of what they've studied and talked about and wrestled with in community
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:58.780]   and the things that we've harped on at home and led them to, they are really making some
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.240]   good, um, comments and some good connections.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   I love that.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.860]   So how do you tell your students to prepare for blue books?
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:13.680]   Um, I do give them throughout the last couple of weeks.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.460]   Hey guys, let's, let's pay attention to this.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.860]   This may be on blue book.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.260]   Right.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.220]   And a lot of parents like to see the prompts ahead of time.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.460]   So I tried about a week or two before you send them, Hey, this is what's going to be on
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.080]   the blue book or tell your student to, you know, maybe read over these, these things again,
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.220]   because I'm going to ask them about it.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:38.060]   And that way the parents know, do not, however, again, create the formal test and send that
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:44.080]   out to your parents because then the student will get it and memorize the answer key that
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.200]   you've also sent your parents.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.500]   Yes.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.720]   Not a good look.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.460]   Not a good look.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.180]   No, no.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.580]   I made that mistake once.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.860]   I'm glad that you said that about sending the prompts to the parents.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.040]   Cause I was going to ask you, what do parents need to know about blue books?
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:06.500]   And, and I would think that they need to, a lot of parents that we deal with, um, only
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.060]   went the public school test route like you and I did.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:17.440]   And so when they hear blue book, they think test and they may need to know that the way
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.500]   to assess classically is somewhat different.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.280]   And so the preparation for that assessment would be somewhat different.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:32.460]   Talk a little bit about how do we help parents know what they can do to help their students?
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.520]   So, um, you know, if, if you, if your students, a director or tutor has not yet sent prompts,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.920]   maybe just ask them, Hey, do you have, what's going to be on the blue book?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.220]   And they probably already do.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.460]   Most people plan several weeks ahead of time.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.940]   Um, and then you can sit down with your student and say, Hey, you know, she said, this is going
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.740]   to be on the blue book.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.340]   Let's have a conversation about it because honestly, you only get, the student only gets a short
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:02.260]   amount of time, maybe an hour per strand, um, and most are less than that.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.200]   Um, so that the student can actually start formulating their ideas and think about it that way.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.020]   They're not staring at an empty page, not knowing what to write.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.620]   So to help the student start formulating those ideas.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.920]   Exactly.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.100]   And I think that's very hospitable for the student because we are still talking about
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.160]   teenagers and even in college.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.220]   I mean, most students know what's going to be on the exam ahead of time.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.520]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, it is.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.640]   It's, there are students who are just deer in the headlights if they see a prompt for the
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.080]   first time and haven't thought about it at all.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.980]   Now there are students who've seen it before and still haven't thought about it at all.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.620]   So for me, that's on them.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:51.180]   But you're right, it's hospitable, um, to give them to kind of prime the pump a little bit
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.980]   and get the juices flowing.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.080]   What do I think about this?
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:01.400]   What, how would I explain the conclusions that I've drawn so that they're not just starting
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.360]   cold?
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.400]   Exactly.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.380]   That's beautiful.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:13.440]   So I think from talking to you, I now really do understand that blue books can be a celebration.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:21.560]   They can be a celebration of the year that you've had as a community, um, as a class, a celebration
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.960]   of what you and your student have done at home together.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.020]   Um, how, give us some ideas.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:36.280]   How can we help students and parents and communities see blue books as celebrations?
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.080]   And what could we do to make it feel like a celebration?
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:50.340]   So I think it's, uh, opening the conversation, um, from, I mean, even foundations and essentials
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.140]   age to say assessment is a celebration.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.260]   It is, it is to celebrate what our students have learned and how they have grown throughout
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.980]   the year and start that, that lingo early at an early age.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:09.020]   Um, and then as they move into the challenge years, um, just remind them, Hey, there is no
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.880]   wrong answer on this.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.260]   We, we want to know your thoughts and ideas and it should not feel stressful.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:23.140]   It should feel like the opportunity to share what, you know, um, and then to make it look
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.480]   like a celebration, many communities, uh, do something fun.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.680]   You know, usually those days are challenge only days anyway.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.740]   Yes, I know.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.520]   And so it's, I mean, however, you know, whatever fits in your budget.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:40.440]   Uh, we've done everything from just having a hot cocoa bar, you know, after the call assessment
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:48.320]   and pizza and just hung out at the church to, um, I, in a moment of insanity, I decided to
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.660]   take my, uh, challenge B students, uh, two hours away.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:57.660]   We all hopped in my car and went two hours away and did some indoor rock climbing.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.120]   And that's how we celebrate it.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:36:59.300]   Oh my word.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.880]   That's great, Emily.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.940]   That's great.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.380]   So, you know, just however crazy you're feeling that day, you know, and a lot of times it ends
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:12.220]   with a pool party or something, but, um, just a way to celebrate the end of the year because
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:18.880]   they have worked so hard and you are celebrating their, their year of hard work.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:25.280]   And so whatever that looks like to your community, um, they make it fun and make them, help them
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.720]   associate that blue book equals good time afterwards.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.420]   Yes.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.160]   I think that's very wise.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:40.000]   Um, and I do think that we do our students a service if we help them learn to self-assess
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.660]   and the self-assessment can be, did I do my best?
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.120]   Um, how have I grown?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.180]   What skills have I gained or what skills have I sharpened?
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.500]   Um, what do I know more about?
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:05.640]   We want blue books to leave our students feeling proud of the effort they've expended and excited
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.260]   about what they've learned and what they're able to do.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.040]   Maybe that they never thought they could do.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:12.600]   Right.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.800]   And I always tack on one question.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.380]   Uh, usually it's in the research strand.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.800]   Um, but how has studying research helped me to know God and make him known?
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.860]   Perfect.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.000]   Or how has, you know, and just fill in the blank.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.760]   How has whatever, studying this helped me to know God and make him known?
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.160]   Because I mean, that's our, that's our mission at CC is to help our students know God.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.900]   And so to help them take a minute to reflect on how has this enhanced my faith?
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.760]   And that's all that.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.960]   Where did I meet God this year?
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.200]   You know, where, how do I see him more clearly?
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.260]   How do I hear his voice?
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.560]   Cause God is always trying to communicate to us.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:02.100]   I think the entire world and the purpose of education is to be able to communicate with
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.900]   God about what he's trying to communicate to us.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.420]   Exactly.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:11.180]   And I think that the more you dive into the literature that has been specifically curated
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.400]   for our, uh, curriculum and the research and, you know, as you move up, you get into the
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.600]   philosophy, you know, all the wonderful, uh, other things that come together.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.520]   It's, um, it's really more integrated into everything, the knowing God.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:32.140]   And so, yeah, just how, how has this year helped me grow my faith and how have I known God more?
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.520]   And that is a beautiful celebration of a year.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.060]   Thank you, Emily.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.580]   Thank you.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.160]   You have said some really profound things and have given us some really good ideas to
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.380]   chew on about blue books.
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:51.900]   Parents, I hope your minds are more set at ease about what a blue book is and what your
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:58.840]   student's role is in preparing and what your role is in supporting them as they prepare.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:06.680]   If you are, if your head is spinning a little bit and you think, wow, I wish I had been assessed
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:13.320]   like this or I wish that I knew more about those classical tools that Emily used to develop
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:21.080]   those classical questions, those prompts, um, you should attend a parent practicum this summer.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:30.260]   Every year in communities all over the world, uh, parents gather to practice those 15 skills,
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.980]   those classical tools.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:40.000]   Um, so that we as parents can become better lead learners in the home, better shepherds of
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.720]   our children.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:47.800]   This summer, we'll be practicing the classical skills, um, on math, on the math map.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:55.020]   You may have students, um, in your home who are going to be diving into the math map for the very
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.480]   first time this year.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.460]   Some of you have students who will be continuing in the math map.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:06.920]   This practicum this summer will not only help you grow as a classical educator, it will help
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:12.900]   you get your hands on and dive into the math map a little bit.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:19.980]   If you're looking for a parent practicum near you, go to ccpracticum.com.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:26.900]   You'll be able to put in your zip code and find a like-minded community who's eager to grow
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.520]   and becoming lead learners just like you are.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.140]   That's ccpracticum.com.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   And we will look for you guys at a practicum this summer.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.260]   Um, Emily, again, thank you for being on and helping us to, to learn how to see blue books
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.460]   as a celebration.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.080]   Yes, you bet.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.920]   I loved it.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.540]   And I love seeing your face.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.240]   Oh, I'm glad to see you too.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.440]   We don't get to see each other often enough face to face.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.280]   All right, you guys, uh, we will see you next week.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.360]   Bye-bye.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:05.340]   Bye-bye.
