[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   The following is a conversation with Konstantin Batygin,
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.480]   planetary astrophysicist at Caltech,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.000]   interested in, among other things,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   the search for the distant, the mysterious Planet Nine
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820]   in the outer regions of our solar system.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.480]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.720]   Squarespace, Litterati, Onnit, and Ni.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.080]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.740]   As a side note, let me say that our little sun
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.080]   is orbited by not just a few planets
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.560]   in the planetary region,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.640]   but trillions of objects in the Kuiper belt
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.320]   and the Oort cloud that extends over three light years out.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.200]   This to me is amazing, since Proxima Centauri,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.640]   the closest star to our sun, is only 4.2 light years away,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.140]   and all of it is mostly covered in darkness.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.280]   When I get a chance to go out swimming in the ocean,
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.000]   far from the shore, I'm sometimes overcome
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.980]   by the terrifying and the exciting feeling
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.300]   of not knowing what's there in the deep darkness.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.060]   That's how I feel about the edge of our solar system.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060]   One day, I hope humans will travel there,
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.300]   or at the very least, AI systems
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.140]   that carry the flame of human consciousness.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.340]   This is the Lux Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.680]   and here's my conversation with Konstantin Batygin.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.100]   What is Planet Nine?
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.200]   Planet Nine is an object that we believe
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.160]   lives in the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.080]   It orbits the sun with a period of about 10,000 years,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.400]   and is about five Earth masses.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.440]   - So that's a hypothesized object.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.800]   There's some evidence for this kind of object.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   There's a bunch of different explanations.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.440]   Can you give an overview of the planets in our solar system?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.020]   How many are there?
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.640]   What do we know and not know about them at a high level?
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520]   - All right, that sounds like a good plan.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.200]   So look, the solar system basically is comprised
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.080]   of two parts, the inner and the outer solar system.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.360]   The inner solar system has the planets,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.700]   Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.700]   Now, Mercury is about 40% of the orbital separation
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.000]   where the Earth is.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240]   It's closer to the sun.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.460]   Venus is about 70%.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.460]   Then Mars is about 160% further away
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.120]   from the sun than is the Earth.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.940]   These planets that we, one of them we occupy,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.540]   are pretty small.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.220]   They're two leading order,
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.280]   sort of heavily overgrown asteroids, if you will.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.620]   And this becomes evident when you move out
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.300]   further in the solar system and encounter Jupiter,
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.300]   which is 316 Earth masses, 10 times the size.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.660]   Saturn is another huge one, 90 Earth masses
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.020]   at about 10 times the separation from the sun
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.860]   as is the Earth.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.600]   And then you have Uranus and Neptune
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.420]   at 20 and 30, respectively.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.420]   For a long time, that is where the kind of massive part
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.260]   of the solar system ended.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.620]   But what we've learned in the last 30 years
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.420]   is that beyond Neptune, there's this expansive field
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.980]   of icy debris, a second icy asteroid belt
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.820]   in the solar system.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.980]   A lot of people have heard of the asteroid belt,
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.860]   which lives between Mars and Jupiter.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.500]   That's a pretty common thing that people like to imagine
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.820]   and draw on lunchboxes and stuff.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.420]   But beyond Neptune, there's a much more massive
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420]   and much more radially expansive field of debris.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.340]   Pluto, by the way, it belongs to that second
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.660]   icy asteroid belt, which we call the Kuiper belt.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.780]   It's just a big object within that population of bodies.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.020]   - Pluto the planet.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.020]   - Pluto, the dwarf planet, the former planet.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.940]   - Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.260]   - I mean, it's tiny.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.940]   We used to-- - Size matters
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.900]   when it comes to planets.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.620]   - 100%, 100%.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.780]   It's actually a fascinating story.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.820]   When Pluto was discovered in 1930,
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.060]   the reason it was discovered in the first place
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.300]   is because astronomers at the time were looking
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.780]   for a seven-Earth mass planet somewhere beyond Neptune.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.940]   It was hypothesized that such an object exists.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.100]   When they found something, they interpreted that
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.940]   as a seven-Earth mass planet and immediately revised
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.620]   its mass downward because they couldn't resolve
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.940]   the object with the telescope.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.180]   So, it looked like just a point mass star
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.060]   rather than a physical disk.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.660]   They said, well, maybe it's not seven, maybe it's one.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.060]   And then, over the next, I guess, 40 years,
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.260]   Pluto's mass kept getting revised downwards,
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.780]   downwards, downwards, until it was realized
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.700]   that it's like 500 times less massive than the Earth.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   I mean, Pluto's surface area is almost perfectly equal
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.100]   to the surface area of Russia, actually.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.700]   And, you know, Russia's big, but it's not a planet.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   (Lex laughing)
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.220]   Well, I mean, actually, we can touch more on that.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.540]   - That's another discussion.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.860]   So, in some sense, earlier in the century,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.700]   Pluto represented kind of our ignorance
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.180]   about the edges of the solar system.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.580]   And perhaps, planet nine is the thing
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.540]   that represents our ignorance about, now,
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.500]   the modern set of ignorances
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.100]   about the edges of our solar system.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.460]   - That's a good way to put it.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.900]   - By the way, just imagining this belt of debris
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.300]   at the edge of our solar system is incredible.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.620]   Can you talk about it a little bit?
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.380]   What is the Kuiper belt, and what is the Oort cloud?
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.940]   - Yeah, okay, so look, the simple way to think about it
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.180]   is that if you imagine, you know, Neptune's orbit
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.060]   like a circle, right?
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.060]   Kind of maybe a factor of 1 1/2, 1.3 times bigger,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.220]   on a radius of 1.3 times bigger,
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.260]   you've got a whole collection of icy objects.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.900]   Most of these objects are sort of the size of Austin,
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.060]   you know, maybe a little bit smaller.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.140]   If you then zoom out, right,
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.220]   and explore the orbits of the most long period
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.900]   Kuiper belt object, these are the things
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.460]   that have the biggest orbits,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.300]   and take the longest time to go around the sun,
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.900]   then what you find is that beyond a critical orbit size,
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.540]   beyond a critical orbit period,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.620]   which is about 4,000 years,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.020]   you start to see weird structure.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.420]   Like all the orbits sort of point into one direction.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.900]   And all the orbits are kind of tilted in the same way,
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.500]   by about 20 degrees with respect to the sun.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.420]   This is particularly pronounced in orbits
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.020]   that are not heavily affected by Neptune.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.020]   So there you start to see this weird dichotomy
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.140]   where there are objects which are stable,
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.060]   which Neptune does not mess with gravitationally,
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.260]   and unstable objects.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.580]   The unstable objects are basically all over the place
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.660]   because they're being, you know, kicked around by Neptune.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.900]   The stable orbits show this remarkable pattern
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.100]   of clustering.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.060]   We, back I guess five years ago,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.180]   interpreted this pattern of clustering
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.020]   as a gravitational one-way sign,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.300]   the existence of a planet, a distant planet, right?
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.580]   Something that is shepherding
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.620]   and confining these orbits together.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.340]   Of course, right, you have to have some skepticism
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.900]   when you're talking about these things.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.220]   You have to ask the question of,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.620]   okay, how statistically significant is this clustering?
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.020]   And there are many authors
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.500]   that have indeed called that into question.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.220]   We have done our own analyses.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.180]   And basically, just like with all statistics,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.860]   where there's kind of like, you know,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.540]   multiple ways to do the exercise,
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.020]   you can either ask the question of,
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.460]   if I have a telescope that has, you know,
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.100]   surveyed this part of the sky,
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.020]   what are the chances that I would discover this clustering?
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.100]   That basically tells you that you have zero confidence,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.500]   right, like that does not give you
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.780]   a confident answer one way or another.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.300]   Another way to do the statistics,
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.260]   which is what we prefer to do,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.860]   is to say we have a whole night sky
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.780]   of discoveries in the Kuiper belt, right?
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.060]   And if we have some object over there,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.380]   which has right ascension and declination,
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.500]   which is a way to say it's there on the sky,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.860]   and it has some brightness,
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.700]   that means somebody looked over there
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.900]   and discovered an object of,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.660]   was able to discover an object
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.180]   of that brightness or brighter.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.660]   Through that analysis,
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.060]   you can construct a whole map on the sky
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.180]   of kind of where all of the surveys
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.220]   that have ever been done have collectively looked.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.900]   So if you do the exercise this way,
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.980]   the false alarm probability of the clustering
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.580]   on which the Planet Nine hypothesis is built
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.820]   is about 0.4%.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.980]   - Wow, okay, so there's a million questions here.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.460]   One, when you say bright objects, why are they bright?
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.860]   Are we talking about actual objects within the Kuiper belt
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.620]   or the stuff we see through the Kuiper belt?
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.340]   - This is the actual stuff we see in the Kuiper belt.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.340]   The way you go about discovering Kuiper belt objects,
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.300]   it's pretty easy.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.500]   I mean, it's easy in theory, right, hard in practice.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.380]   All you do is you take snapshots of the sky, right,
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.580]   choose that direction, say,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.060]   and take the high exposure snapshot.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.700]   Then you wait a night and you do it again,
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.340]   and then you wait another night and you do it again.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.420]   Objects that are just random stars in the galaxy
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.020]   don't move on the sky,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.860]   whereas objects in the solar system will slowly move.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.020]   This is no different than if you're driving down the freeway
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.700]   it looks like trees are going by you faster than the clouds.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.420]   Right, this is parallax.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.260]   That's it.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.300]   It's just they're reflecting light off of the sun
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.260]   and it's going back and hitting this.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.860]   - There's a little bit of a glimmer
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.020]   from the different objects that you can see
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.660]   based on the reflection from the sun.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.000]   So like there's actual light, it's not darkness.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.260]   - That's right, these are just big icicles basically
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.620]   that are just reflecting sunlight back at you.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.140]   It's then easy to understand why it's so hard
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.820]   to discover them because light has to travel
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.180]   to something like 40 times the distance
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.420]   between the earth and the sun and then get reflected back.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.020]   - Was that like an hour travel?
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.460]   - Yeah, that's right, that's something like that.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.020]   'Cause the earth to the sun is eight minutes, I believe.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.140]   - Something, you know.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.100]   - Yeah, hours.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.900]   - Yeah, in that order of magnitude.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.580]   So that's interesting.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.180]   So you have to account for all of that
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.500]   and then there's this huge amount of data,
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.140]   pixels that are coming from the pictures
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.300]   and you have to integrate all of that together
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.620]   to paint a sort of like a high estimate
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.660]   of the different objects.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.620]   Can you track them?
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.860]   Can you be like, that's Bob?
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.900]   Like can you like?
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.260]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.400]   In fact, one of them is named Joe Biden.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.900]   Like this is not even a joke.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.100]   - Is there a Trump one or no?
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.940]   - No, no.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.780]   - Not yet.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.780]   - I don't know, I haven't checked for that
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.540]   but like the way it works is if you discover one,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.940]   you right away get a license plate for it.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.380]   So like the first four numbers is the first year
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.940]   that this object has appeared on, you know,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.700]   in the data set, if you will.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.380]   And then there's like this code that follows it,
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.100]   which basically tells you where in the sky it is, right?
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.580]   So one of the really interesting Kuiper belt objects,
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.260]   which is very much part of the Planet Nine story
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.260]   is called VP113 because Joe Biden was vice president
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.700]   at the time, you know, got nicknamed Biden.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.140]   - VP113, you said?
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.220]   - Yeah.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.140]   - He got nicknamed Biden, beautiful.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.620]   What's the fingerprint for any particular object?
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.260]   Like how do you know it's the same one?
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.060]   Or it's just kind of like, yeah, from night to night,
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.540]   you take a picture, how do you know it's the same object?
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.740]   - Yeah, so the way you know is it appears
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.620]   in almost exactly the same part of the sky
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.300]   except for it moves by.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.020]   And this is why actually you need at least three nights
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.820]   because oftentimes asteroids, which are much closer
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   to the Earth, like will appear to move only slightly,
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.540]   but then on the third night will move away.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.300]   So that third night is really there to detect acceleration.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.460]   Now, the thing that I didn't really realize
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.780]   until I started observing together with my partner
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   in crime in all this, Mike Brown,
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.380]   is just the fact that for the first year
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.200]   when you make these detections,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.060]   the only thing you really know with confidence
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.740]   is where it is on the night sky and how far away it is.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.820]   Okay, that's it.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.740]   You don't know anything about the orbit
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.740]   because over three days, the object just moves so little.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.140]   That whole motion on the sky is entirely coming
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.180]   from motion of the Earth.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.700]   So the Earth is kind of the car,
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.300]   the object is the tree and you see it move.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.460]   So then to get some confident information
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.560]   about what its orbit looks like,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.340]   you have to come back a year later
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.340]   and then measure it again.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.020]   - Oh, interesting, so do three nights
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.220]   then come back a year later and do another three nights
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.980]   so you get the velocity of the acceleration
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.180]   from the three nights and then you have the maybe--
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.020]   - The additional.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.340]   - The additional information.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.420]   - 'Cause an orbit is basically described by six parameters.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.620]   So you at least need six independent points
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.300]   but in reality you need many more observations
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.500]   to really pin down the orbit well.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.040]   - And from that, you're able to construct
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.920]   for that one particular object an orbit
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.700]   and then there's of course, how many objects are there?
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.060]   - There's like four-ish thousand now.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.060]   But in the future, that could be like millions.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.340]   - Oh sure, oh sure.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.060]   In fact, these things are hard to predict
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.260]   but there's a new observatory called
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.060]   the Vera Rubin Observatory which is coming online
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.180]   maybe next year.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.380]   I mean, with COVID, these things are
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.580]   a little bit more uncertain
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.860]   but they've actually been making great progress
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.340]   with construction and so that telescope
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.060]   is gonna sort of scan the night sky
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.020]   every day automatically and it's such an efficient survey
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.020]   that it might increase the census of the distant Kuiper belt
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.620]   the things that I'm interested in by a factor of 100.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.020]   I mean, that would be really cool.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.140]   - And yeah, that's an incredible--
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.560]   - I mean, they might just find planet nine.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.340]   I mean, that's--
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.740]   - Almost like literally pictures, like visually.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.860]   - I mean, sure, yeah.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.180]   The first detection you make,
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.860]   all you know is where it is in the sky
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.660]   and how far away it is.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.780]   If something is 500 times away from the sun,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.820]   as far away from the sun as is the earth,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.980]   you know that's planet nine.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.620]   That's when the story concludes.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.820]   Then you can study it.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.940]   - Now you can study it, yeah.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.500]   By the way, I'm gonna use that as like,
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.620]   I don't know, a pickup line or a dating strategy.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.060]   Like see the person for three days
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.140]   and then don't see them at all
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.620]   and then see them again in a year
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.900]   to determine the orbit.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.380]   And over time, you figure out if sort of
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.820]   from a cosmic perspective, this whole thing works out.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.580]   - I have no dating advice to give.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.780]   - I was gonna use this as a metaphor
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.940]   to somehow map it onto the human condition.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.540]   Okay, you mentioned the Kuiper belt.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.860]   What's the Oort cloud?
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.980]   If you look at the Neptune orbit as one,
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.860]   then the Kuiper belt is like 1.3 out there.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.340]   And then we get farther and farther into the darkness.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.180]   What's the Oort cloud?
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.580]   - So, okay, you've got the main Kuiper belt
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.860]   which is about say 1.3, 1.5.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.100]   Then you have something called the scattered disk,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.620]   which is kind of an extension of the Kuiper belt.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.220]   It's a bunch of these long, very elliptical orbits
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.140]   that hug the orbit of Neptune but come out very far.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.140]   So, the scattered disk with the current senses,
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.660]   like some of the longest orbits we know of,
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:06.260]   have a semi-major axis, so half the orbit length,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.900]   roughly speaking, of about 1,000.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.140]   1,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.300]   Now, if you keep moving out, okay,
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.340]   eventually, once you're at sort of 10,000
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.460]   to 100,000 roughly, that's where the Oort cloud is.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.460]   Now, the Oort cloud is a distinct population of icy bodies
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.340]   and is distinct from the Kuiper belt.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.300]   In fact, it's so expansive that it ends roughly halfway
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.940]   between us and the next star.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.540]   Its edge is just dictated by
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.020]   to what extent does the solar gravity reach.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.060]   - Solar gravity reaches that far?
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.900]   - Yeah.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.940]   - It has to, wow.
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.780]   - Yeah.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.980]   - Imagining this is a little bit overwhelming.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   So, there's like a giant, like vast, icy rock thingy.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.380]   - It's like a sphere.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.780]   It's like, you know, it's almost spherical structure
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.620]   that encircles the Sun.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.340]   And all the long period comets come from the Oort cloud.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.660]   They come, the way that they appear,
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.620]   I mean, for already, I don't know, hundreds of years,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.780]   we've been detecting occasionally,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.260]   like a comet will come in
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.580]   and it seemingly comes out of nowhere.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.700]   The reason these long period comets appear
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.180]   that on very, very long timescales, right?
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.020]   These Oort cloud objects that are sitting, you know,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.420]   30,000 times as far away from the Sun as is the Earth
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.740]   actually interact with the gravity of the galaxy,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.380]   the tide, effectively the tide that the galaxy
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.980]   exerts upon them and their orbits slowly change
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.340]   and they elongate to the point where once they,
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.940]   their closest approach to the Sun
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.300]   starts to reach a critical distance
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.260]   where ice starts to sublimate,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.860]   then we discover them as comets
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.220]   because then the ice comes off of them.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.940]   They look beautiful in the night sky, et cetera,
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.020]   but they're all coming from, you know,
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.380]   really, really far away.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.140]   - So is there, are any of them coming our way from collisions
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.660]   like how many collisions are there
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.820]   or is there a bunch of space for them to move around?
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.660]   - Yeah, there's zero, it's completely collisionless.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.620]   Out there, the physical radii of objects are so small
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.940]   compared to the distance between them, right?
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.940]   It's just, it is truly a collisionless environment.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.980]   I don't know, I think that probably in the age
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.060]   of the solar system, there have literally been
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.180]   zero collisions in the Oort cloud.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.540]   - Wow, when you like draw a picture of the solar system,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.820]   everything's really close together,
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.580]   so everything I guess here is spaced far apart.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.540]   Do rogue planets like fly in every once in a while
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.020]   and join, not rogue planets, but rogue objects
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.020]   from out there?
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.500]   - Oh sure, oh sure, yeah.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.380]   - Join the party?
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.440]   We've seen a couple of them in the last three or so years,
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.700]   maybe four years now.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:20.080]   The first one was the one called Oumuamua,
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.980]   it's been all over the news.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.340]   The second one was Comet Borisov,
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.060]   discovered by a guy named Borisov.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.140]   Yeah, so the way you know they're coming from elsewhere
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.860]   is unlike solar system objects,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.540]   which travel on elliptical paths around the sun,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.960]   these guys travel on hyperbolic paths.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.080]   So they come in, say hello, and then they're gone.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   And the fact that they exist is totally not surprising.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:57.720]   The Neptune is constantly ejecting Kuiper belt objects
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.900]   into interstellar space.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.780]   Our solar system itself is sort of leaking icy debris
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.620]   and ejecting it.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.980]   So presumably every planetary systems around other stars
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.780]   do exactly the same thing.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.160]   - Let me ask you about the millions of objects
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.620]   that are part of the Kuiper belt
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.880]   and part of the Oort cloud.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.140]   Do you think some of them have primitive life?
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.880]   It kind of makes you sad.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.260]   If there's primitive life there
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.860]   and they're just kind of lonely out there in space.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.780]   How many of them do you think have life, bacterial life?
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.580]   - Probably a negligible amount.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.020]   Zero with a plus on top.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.600]   - Zero plus plus.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.440]   - Yeah.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.680]   (laughing)
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.980]   So if you and I took a little trip
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.340]   to the interstellar medium,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.180]   I think we would develop cancer and die real fast.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.300]   - That's rough.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.820]   - Yeah, it's a pretty hostile radiation environment.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.700]   You don't actually have to go to the interstellar medium.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.140]   You just have to leave the Earth's magnetic field too.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.340]   And then you're not doing so well suddenly.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.340]   So this idea of life kind of traveling between places
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.780]   it's not entirely implausible,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.900]   but you really have to twist, I think, a lot of parameters.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.420]   One of the problems we have
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.980]   is we don't actually know how life originates.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.980]   So it's kind of a second order question of survival
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.660]   in the interstellar medium and how resilient it is
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.660]   because we think you require water,
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.020]   and that's certainly the case for the Earth.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   But we really don't know for sure.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.700]   That said, I will argue that the question of
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.820]   are there aliens out there is a very boring question
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.100]   because the answer is of course there are.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.940]   - Right.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.460]   - I mean, we know that there are planets
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.620]   around almost every star.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.860]   Of course there are other life forms.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.860]   Life is not a planet.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.180]   Of course there are other life forms.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.620]   Life is not some specific thing that happened on the Earth
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.100]   and that's it, right?
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's a statistical impossibility.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.860]   - Yeah, but the difficult question is
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.900]   before even the fact that we don't know
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.700]   how life originates,
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.940]   I don't think we even know what life is, like,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.060]   definitionally.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.900]   - Yeah.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.780]   - Like, formalizing a kind of picture of,
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.580]   in terms of the mechanism we would use
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.540]   to search for life out there,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.980]   or even when we're on a planet,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.420]   to say, is this life?
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.420]   Is this rock that just moved
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.760]   from where it was yesterday life?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.020]   Or maybe not even a rock, something else.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.140]   - I gotta tell you, I wanna know what life is.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:46.960]   Okay?
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.460]   And I want you to show me.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.720]   (laughing)
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.860]   - I think there's a song to basically accompany
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.980]   every single thing we talk about today.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.180]   And probably half of them are love songs.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.800]   And somehow we'll integrate George Michael
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.640]   into the whole thing.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.800]   Okay, so your intuition is there's life everywhere
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.940]   in our universe.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.540]   Do you think there's intelligent life out there?
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.980]   - I think it's entirely plausible.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.840]   I mean, it's entirely plausible.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.480]   I think there's intelligent life on Earth.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.660]   And--
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.260]   - So yeah, taking that, like, say,
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.940]   whatever this thing we got on Earth,
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.780]   whether it's dolphins or humans,
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.540]   say that's intelligent.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.020]   - Definitely dolphins.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.360]   - I mean, have you seen the dolphins?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.940]   - Well, they do some cruel stuff to each other.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.340]   So if cruelty is a definition of intelligence,
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.500]   they're pretty good.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.900]   And then humans are pretty good in that regard.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   Then there's like, pigs are very intelligent.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.740]   I got actually a chance to hang out with pigs recently.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.140]   And they're, aside from the fact
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.200]   they were trying to eat me,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.400]   they're very, they love food.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.940]   They love food, but there's an intelligence
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.820]   to their eyes that was kind of, like, haunts me
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.540]   because I also love to eat meat.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.740]   And then to meet the thing I later ate,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.820]   and it was very intelligent and almost charismatic
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.620]   with the way it was expressing himself, herself, itself,
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.340]   was quite incredible.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.100]   So all that to say is if we have intelligent life
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.540]   here on Earth, if we take dolphins, pigs, humans,
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.740]   from the perspective of planetary science,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.700]   how unique is Earth?
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.860]   - Okay, so Earth is not a common outcome
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.320]   of the planet formation process.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.440]   It's probably something on the order
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.180]   of maybe a 1% effect.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.180]   And by Earth, I mean not just an Earth-mass planet, okay?
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.980]   I mean the architecture of the solar system
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.420]   that allows the Earth to exist
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.820]   in its kind of very temperate way.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:10.620]   One thing to understand, and this is pretty crucial,
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.620]   is that the Earth itself formed well after the gas disk
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:22.180]   that formed the giant planets had already dissipated.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.740]   You see, stars start out with the star,
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.380]   and then a disk of gas and dust that encircles it, okay?
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:35.380]   From this disk of gas and dust, big planets can emerge.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.260]   And we have, over the last two, three decades,
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.500]   discovered thousands of extrasolar planets,
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.980]   as in orbit of other stars.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.980]   What we see is that many of them
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.940]   have these expansive hydrogen-helium atmospheres.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.940]   The fact that the Earth doesn't is deeply connected
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.480]   to the fact that Earth took about 100 million years to form.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.740]   So we missed that train, so to speak,
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.860]   to get that hydrogen-helium atmosphere.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.420]   That's why, actually, we can see the sky, right?
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.920]   That's why the sky is, well, at least in most places,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.000]   that's why the atmosphere is not completely opaque.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.540]   With that kind of thinking in mind,
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.580]   I would argue that we're getting
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.980]   the kind of emergent pictures
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.980]   that the Earth is not everywhere, right?
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.420]   There's sort of the sci-fi view of things
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.960]   where we go to some other star
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.700]   and we just land on random planets
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.180]   and they're all Earth-like.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.740]   That's totally not true.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.720]   But even a low-probability event,
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.180]   even if you imagine that Earth is a one in a million
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.940]   or one in 10 million occurrence,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.180]   there are 10 to the 12 stars in the galaxy.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.660]   So you always win by--
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.420]   - Large numbers. - That's right, by supply.
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.260]   - They save you.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.260]   Well, you've hypothesized that our solar system
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.880]   once possessed a population of short-period planets
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.180]   that were destroyed by the evil Jupiter
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.540]   migrating through the solar nebula.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.540]   Can you explain?
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.740]   - If I was to say what was the key outcome
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.060]   of searches for extrasolar planets,
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.820]   it is that most stars are encircled by short-period planets
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.100]   that are a few Earth masses,
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.940]   so a few times bigger than the Earth,
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.100]   and have orbital periods
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.640]   that kind of range from days to weeks.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.060]   Now, if you go and ask the solar system
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.580]   what's in our region, in that region,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.780]   it's completely empty.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.580]   It's astonishingly hollow.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:58.580]   And I think from the Sun is not some special star
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.140]   that decided that it was going to form the solar system.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.260]   So I think the natural thing to assume
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.740]   is that the same processes of planet formation
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.340]   that occurred everywhere else
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.700]   also occurred in the solar system,
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.700]   following this logic.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.900]   It's not implausible to imagine
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.100]   that the solar system once possessed
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.260]   a system of intra-Mercurian,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.460]   like compact system of planets.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.380]   So then we asked ourselves,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.340]   would such a system survive to this day?
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.380]   And the answer is no.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.960]   At least our calculations suggest it's highly unlikely
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.620]   because of the formation of Jupiter,
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.740]   and Jupiter's primordial kind of wandering
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.820]   through the solar system
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.180]   would have sent this collisional field of debris
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.580]   that would have pushed that system of planets onto the Sun.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.300]   - So was Jupiter, this primordial wandering,
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.500]   what did Jupiter look like?
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.020]   Like why was it wandering?
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.640]   It didn't have the orbit it has today?
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.020]   - We're pretty certain that giant planets like Jupiter,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.020]   when they form, they migrate.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.980]   The reason they migrate is, you know,
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.540]   on a detailed level, perhaps difficult to explain,
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.620]   but just in a qualitative sense,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.340]   they form in this fluid disk of gas and dust.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.660]   So it's kind of like,
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.500]   then if I plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean,
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.940]   will it stay where you plop it down
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.300]   or will it kind of get carried around?
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.100]   It's not really a good analogy
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.660]   because it's not like Jupiter is being advected
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.220]   by the currents of gas and dust,
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.220]   but the way it migrates is it carves out a hole in the disk
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.880]   and then by interacting with the disk gravitationally,
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.940]   it can change its orbit.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.380]   The fact that the solar system has both Jupiter and Saturn,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.700]   here complicates things a lot,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.000]   because you have to solve the problem
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.140]   of the evolution of the gas disk,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.540]   the evolution of Jupiter's orbit in the gas disk,
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.460]   plus evolution of Saturn's and their mutual interaction.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:13.180]   The common outcome of solving that problem though,
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.460]   is pretty easy to explain.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.100]   Jupiter forms, its orbit shrinks,
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.120]   and then once Saturn forms,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.200]   its orbit catches up basically to the orbit of Jupiter
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.780]   and then both come out.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.760]   So there's this inward-outward pattern
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.460]   of Jupiter's early motion that happens
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.740]   sort of within the last million years
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.720]   of the lifetime of the solar system's primordial disk.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.180]   So while this is happening,
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.940]   if our calculations are correct, which I think they are,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.580]   you can destroy this inner system
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.780]   of few Earth-mass planets.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.540]   And then in the aftermath of all this violence,
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.400]   you form the terrestrial planets.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.380]   - Where would they come from in that case?
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.820]   So Jupiter clears out the space,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.100]   and then there's a few terrestrial planets that come in,
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.020]   and those come in from the disk somewhere,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.260]   like one of the larger objects?
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.940]   - What actually happens in these calculations,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.940]   you leave behind a rather mass-depleted remnant disk,
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.340]   only a couple Earth-masses.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:28.340]   So then from that remnant population,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.900]   annulus of material over 100 million years,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.540]   by just collisions, you grow the Earth
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.220]   and the moon and everything else.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.540]   - You said amulus?
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.380]   - Annulus.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.200]   - Annulus.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   - Annulus, yeah.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.880]   - That's a beautiful word.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.700]   What does that mean?
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.140]   - Well, it's like a disk that's kind of thin.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.740]   It's like a, yeah, it's something that is, you know,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.180]   a disk that's so thin it's almost flirting
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.100]   with being a ring.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.940]   - Like, I was gonna say this,
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.300]   reminds me of "Lord of the Rings."
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.620]   The word just feels like it belongs in a Tolkien novel.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.180]   Okay, so that's incredible.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.260]   And so that, in your senses, you said like 1%,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.940]   that's a rare, the way Jupiter and Saturn danced
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.940]   and cleared out the short period debris,
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.580]   and then changed the gravitational landscape,
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.220]   that's a pretty rare thing too.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.500]   - It's rare, and moreover, you don't even have to go
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.800]   to our calculations.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.180]   You can just ask the night sky,
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.060]   how many stars have Jupiter and Saturn analogs?
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.540]   And the answer is Jupiter and Saturn analogs
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.420]   are found around only 10% of sun-like stars.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.780]   So they themselves, like you kind of have to score
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.060]   an A minus or better on the test to,
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.900]   on the planet formation test to become
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.620]   a solar system analog, even in that basic sense.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.420]   And moreover, lower mass stars,
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.400]   which are very numerous in the galaxy,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.320]   so-called M dwarfs, think like 0% of them,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.360]   well, maybe like a negligible fraction of them
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.960]   have giant planets.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   Giant planets are a rare outcome of planet formation.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.160]   One of the really big problems that remain unanswered
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.320]   is why, we don't actually understand why they're so rare.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.200]   - How hard is it to simulate all of the things
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.760]   we've been talking about, each of the things
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.620]   we've been talking about, and maybe one day,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.500]   all of the things we've been talking about and beyond.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   Meaning, like from the initial primordial solar system,
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.380]   you know, a bunch of disks with, I don't know,
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.880]   billions, trillions of objects in them,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.220]   like simulate that such that you eventually get a Jupiter
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.100]   and a Saturn, and then eventually you get the Jupiter
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.420]   and the Saturn that clear out a disk,
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.940]   change the gravitational landscape, then Earth pops up.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.340]   Like that whole thing, and then be able to do that
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.340]   for every other system, every other star in the galaxy,
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.260]   and then be able to do that for other galaxies as well.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   - Yeah, so look--
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.340]   - Maybe start from the smallest simulation,
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.380]   like what is actually being done today.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.860]   I mean, even the smallest simulation
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.300]   is probably super, super difficult.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.460]   Even just like one object in the Kuiper belt
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.340]   is probably super difficult to simulate.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.380]   - I mean, I think it's super easy.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.460]   I mean, like it's just not that hard.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   But let's ask the most kind of basic problem.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.060]   Okay, so the problem of having a star
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.880]   and something in orbit of it,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.300]   that you don't need a simulation for.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   Like you can just write that down on a piece of paper.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.620]   - There's gravity, like yeah, I guess it's important
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   to try to, you know, one way to simulate objects
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.540]   in our solar system is to build the universe from scratch.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.600]   - Okay, we'll get to building the universe
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.040]   from scratch in a sec.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.320]   But let me just kind of go through the hierarchy
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.480]   of what we do.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.320]   - Two objects.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.240]   - Two objects, analytically solvable,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.560]   like we can figure it out very easily.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.920]   If you just, I don't think you, yeah,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.640]   you don't need to know calculus.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.800]   It helps to know calculus,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.200]   but you don't necessarily need to know calculus.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.840]   Three objects that are gravitationally interacting,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.360]   the solution is chaotic.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.840]   Doesn't matter how many simulations you do,
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.280]   the answer loses meaning after some time.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.640]   - I feel like that is a metaphor for dating as well,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.480]   but go on.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.200]   (laughing)
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   - Now look, yeah, so the fact that you go
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.000]   from analytically solvable to unpredictable,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.280]   you know, when your simulation goes from two bodies
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.240]   to three bodies, should immediately tell you
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   that the exercise of trying to engineer a calculation
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.280]   where you form the entire solar system from scratch
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   and hope to have some predictive answer is a futile one.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.600]   We will never succeed at such a simulation.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.640]   - I feel like, sorry, just to clarify,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   you mean like explicitly having a clear equation
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.960]   that generalizes the whole process enough
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.400]   to be able to make a prediction?
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.180]   Or do you mean actually like literally simulating
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.040]   the objects is a hopeless pursuit
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.680]   once it increases beyond three?
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   - The simulating them is not a hopeless pursuit,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   but the outcome becomes a statistical one.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.720]   What's actually quite interesting is I think we have
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.520]   all the equations figured out, right?
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.840]   Like, you know, in order to really understand this,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.920]   the formation of the solar system,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.840]   it suffices to know gravity and magnetohydrodynamics.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.340]   I mean, like the combination of Maxwell's equations
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.460]   and, you know, Navier-Stokes equations for the fluids.
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.860]   You need to know quantum mechanics
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.680]   to understand opacities and so on.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.060]   But we have those equations in hand.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.220]   It's not that we don't have that understanding,
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.180]   it's that putting it all together
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.060]   is A, very, very difficult,
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:11.060]   and B, if you were to run the same evolution twice,
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.600]   changing the initial conditions
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   by some infinitesimal amount,
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.580]   some minor change in your calculation to start with,
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.040]   you would get a different answer.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.840]   This is one, this is part of the reason
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.620]   why planetary systems are so diverse.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.000]   You don't have like a very predictive path
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.760]   for you start with a disk of this mass
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.160]   and it's around this star,
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.340]   therefore you're gonna form the solar system, right?
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.580]   You start with this and therefore you will form
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.300]   this huge set of outcomes and some percentage of it
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.860]   will resemble the solar system.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.180]   - You mentioned quantum mechanics
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:57.180]   and we're talking about cosmic scale objects.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.440]   You've talked about that the evolution
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.520]   of astrophysical disks can be modeled
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.700]   with Schrodinger's equation.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.600]   - I sure did.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.860]   - Why?
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.700]   (laughing)
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.580]   How does quantum mechanics become relevant
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.580]   when you consider the evolution of objects
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.420]   in the solar system?
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.140]   - Yeah, well, let me take a step back and just say it.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.140]   I remember being utterly confused by quantum mechanics
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.500]   when I first learned it.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.700]   And the Schrodinger equation,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.380]   which is kind of the parent equation of that whole field,
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.260]   seems to come out of nowhere, right?
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.980]   The way that I was sort of explaining it,
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.100]   I remember asking my professor,
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.820]   "But where does it come from?"
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.860]   He's like, "Well, just don't worry about it
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.180]   "and just calculate the hydrogen energy levels."
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.340]   So it's like I could do all the problems,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.460]   I just did not have any intuition
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   for where this parent super important equation came from.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.060]   Now down the line, I remember I was preparing
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.500]   for my own lecture and I was trying to understand
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.820]   how waves travel in self-gravitating disks.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.820]   So, again, there's a very broad theory
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.740]   that's already developed,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.900]   but I was looking for some simpler way to explain it,
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.660]   really, for the purposes of teaching class.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.820]   And so I thought, "Okay, what if I just imagine a disk
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.340]   "as an infinite number of concentric circles, right,
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.980]   "that interact with each other gravitationally?"
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.380]   That's a problem in some sense that I can solve
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.580]   using methods from like the late 1700s, right?
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.180]   So I can write down Hamiltonian,
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.420]   well, I can write down the energy function, basically,
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.500]   of their interactions.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   And what I found is that when you take the continuum limit,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.220]   when you go from discrete circles
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.020]   that are talking to each other gravitationally
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.580]   to a continuum disk,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.580]   suddenly this gravitational interaction among them,
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.740]   right, the governing equation
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.900]   becomes the Schrodinger equation.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.260]   - Yeah. - I had to think about that
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.100]   for a little bit.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.660]   - Did you just unify quantum mechanics and gravity?
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.380]   - No, this is not the same thing as like,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.540]   you know, fusing relativity and quantum mechanics.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.460]   But it did get me thinking a little bit.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.820]   So the fact that waves in astrophysical disks
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.980]   behave just like wave functions of particles
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.860]   is kind of like an interesting analogy
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.060]   because for me it's easier to imagine waves
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.420]   traveling through astrophysical disks
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.260]   or really just sheets of paper.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.100]   And the reason this is, that analogy exists
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.460]   is because there's actually nothing quantum
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.220]   about the Schrodinger equation.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.500]   The Schrodinger equation is just a wave equation
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   and all of the interpretation that comes from it is quantum,
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:11.260]   but the equation itself is not a quantum being.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.460]   - So you can use it to model waves.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.100]   It's waves, it's not turtles, it's waves all the way down.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.860]   You can pick which level you pick the wave at.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.820]   And so it could be at the solar system level
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.060]   that you can use that. - Right.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.420]   And also it actually provides
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.380]   a pretty neat calculational tool
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.780]   because it's difficult.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.540]   So we just talked about simulations,
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.220]   but it's difficult to simulate
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.820]   the behavior of astrophysical disks
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.820]   on timescales that are in between a few orbits
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.260]   and their entire evolution.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.220]   So it's over a timescale of a few orbits,
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:49.180]   you do a hydrodynamic simulation, right?
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.300]   You do, basically that's something that you can do
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.420]   on a modern computer on a timescale of say a week.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.100]   When it comes to their evolution over their entire lifetime,
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.000]   you don't hope to resolve the orbits.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.420]   You just kind of hope to understand
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.100]   how the system behaves in between, right?
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.380]   To get access to that, as it turns out,
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.460]   it's pretty cute.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.960]   You can use the Schrodinger equation
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.820]   to get the answer rapidly.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.420]   So it's a calculational tool.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.240]   - That's fascinating.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.980]   By the way, the astrophysical disks,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.660]   how broad is this definition?
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:28.660]   - Okay, so astrophysical disks span a huge amount of ranges.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.700]   They start maybe at the smallest scale.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.700]   They start with actually Kuiper belt objects.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.720]   Some Kuiper belt objects have rings.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.980]   So that's maybe the smallest example
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.220]   of an astrophysical disk.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.740]   You've got this little potato-shaped asteroid,
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.100]   which is sort of the size of LA or something,
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.940]   and around it are some rings of icy matter.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.940]   That object is a small astrophysical disk.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.800]   Then you have Saturn, the rings of Saturn.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.540]   You have the next set of scale.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.860]   You have the solar system itself when it was forming.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.700]   You have a disk.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.500]   Then you have black hole disks.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   You have galaxies.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.180]   Disks are super common in the universe.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.480]   The reason is that stuff rotates.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.900]   Right, I mean, that's-- - Gravity works.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.740]   - Yeah.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.300]   - And those rings could be the material
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.380]   that composes those rings.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.020]   It could be gas.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.060]   It could be solid.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   It could be anything.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:27.880]   - That's right.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.880]   So the disk that made, from which the planets emerged,
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.000]   was predominantly hydrogen and helium gas.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.380]   On the other hand, the rings of Saturn
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   are made up of icicle, little like ice cubes this big,
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.820]   about a centimeter across.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.900]   - That sounds refreshing.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.020]   So that's incredible, hydrogen and helium gas.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.980]   So in the beginning, it was just hydrogen and helium
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.860]   around the sun.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.100]   How does that lead to the first formations of solid objects
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.860]   in terms of simulation?
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.580]   - Okay, here's the story.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:07.740]   So you're like, have you ever been to the desert?
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.340]   - Yes, I've been to the Death Valley.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.200]   And actually, it was terrifying, just a total tangent.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.460]   I'm distracting you.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.680]   But I was driving through it, and I was really surprised
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.180]   because it was, at first, hot.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.580]   And then, as it was getting into the evening,
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.760]   there's this huge thunderstorm.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.020]   It was raining, and it got freezing cold.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:26.860]   Like, what the hell?
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.300]   It was the apocalypse.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.740]   I had to just sit there, listening to Bruce Springsteen,
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.780]   I remember, and just thinking, I'm probably going to die.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.020]   And I was okay with it
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.700]   because Bruce Springsteen was on the radio.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.420]   - Look, when you've got the boss,
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.140]   you're ready to meet the boss.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.100]   Yeah, so look, I mean--
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.140]   - That's a good line.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.420]   So anyway, sorry, the desert.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.260]   - It's true.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.460]   Yeah, by the way, to continue on this tangent,
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.980]   I absolutely love the Southwest for this reason.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:01.420]   During the pandemic, I drove from LA to New Mexico
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.300]   a bunch of times.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.820]   - The madness of weather.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.460]   - Yeah, the chaos of weather.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.980]   The fact that it'll be blazing hot one minute,
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.460]   and then it's just like,
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.220]   we'll decide to have a little thunderstorm.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.820]   Maybe we'll decide to go back momentarily
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.340]   to like a thousand degrees
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.020]   and then go back to the thunderstorm.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.620]   It's amazing.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.360]   That, by the way, is chaos theory in action.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.100]   But let's get back to talking about the desert.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.420]   So in the desert, tumbleweeds have a tendency to roll
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.380]   because the wind rolls them.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.740]   And if you're careful,
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.140]   you'll occasionally see this family of tumbleweeds
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.020]   where there's a big one,
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.700]   and then a bunch of little ones
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.620]   that kind of hide in its wake,
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.940]   and are all rolling together
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.740]   and almost looks like a family of ducks
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.300]   crossing a street or something.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.980]   Or for example, if you watch Tour de France,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.060]   you've got a whole bunch of cyclists
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.180]   and they're like cycling within 10 centimeters
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.020]   of each other.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.860]   They're not BFFs, right?
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.260]   They're not trying to ride together.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.580]   They are riding together to minimize the collective
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.080]   air resistance, if you will, that they experience.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   Turns out solids in the protoplanetary disk do just this.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:26.740]   There's an instability wherein solid particles,
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.660]   things that are a centimeter across
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.740]   will start to hide behind one another
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.740]   and form these clouds.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.580]   Why?
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.500]   Because cumulatively that minimizes the solid component
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.820]   of this aerodynamic interaction with the gas.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.060]   Now, these clouds,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.860]   because they're kind of a favorable energetic condition
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.740]   for the dust to live in,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.980]   they grow, grow, grow, grow, grow
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.340]   until they become so massive
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.680]   that they collapse under their own weight.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.540]   That's how the first building blocks of planets form.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.260]   That's how the big asteroids got there.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.100]   - That's incredible.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:03.940]   - Yeah.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.900]   - So is that simulatable or is it not useful to simulate?
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.140]   - No, no, that's simulatable.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.020]   And people do these types of calculations.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.540]   It's really cool.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.340]   That's actually, that's one of the many fields
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.640]   of planet formation theory that is really, really active.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.380]   Right now, people are trying to understand
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.900]   all kinds of aspects of that process.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.100]   Because of course, I've explained it
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   like as if there's one thing that happens.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:33.900]   Turns out it's a beautifully rich dynamic,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.640]   but qualitatively formation of the first building blocks
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.460]   actually follows the same sequence
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.060]   as formation of stars, right?
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.860]   Stars are just clouds of gas, hydrogen helium gas
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:50.460]   that sit in space and slowly cool.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.460]   And at some point, they contract to a point
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.740]   where their gravity overtakes the thermal pressure support,
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.820]   if you will, and they collapse under their own weight
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.460]   and you get a little baby solar system.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.300]   - That's amazing.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.180]   So do you think one day it will be possible
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.180]   to simulate the full history that took our solar system
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.700]   to what it is today?
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.380]   - Yes, and it will be useless.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.420]   - Okay.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.920]   So you don't think your story,
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.080]   many of the ideas that you have about Jupiter
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.820]   clearing the space, like retelling that story
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.800]   in high resolution is not that important?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.020]   - I actually think it's important,
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:33.020]   but at every stage, you have to design your experiments,
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.200]   your numerical computer experiments
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   so that they test some specific aspect of that evolution.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.280]   I am not a proponent of doing huge simulations
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   because even if we forget the information theory aspect
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:59.560]   of not being able to simulate in full detail the universe,
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.660]   because if you do, then you have made an actual universe.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.040]   It's not a simulation, right?
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.400]   By simulation is in some sense, a compression of information
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.320]   so therefore you must lose detail.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   But that point aside, if we are able to simulate
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.240]   the entire history of the solar system
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.140]   in excruciating detail, I mean, it'll be cool,
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.940]   but it's not gonna be any different from observing it,
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.360]   because theoretical understanding,
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.800]   which is what ultimately I'm interested in,
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.420]   comes from taking complex things
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.240]   and reducing them down to something that,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.180]   some mechanism that you can actually quantify.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:51.040]   That's the fun part of astrophysics,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.280]   just kind of simulating things in extreme detail
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.200]   is we'll make cool visualizations,
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   but that doesn't get you to any better understanding
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.000]   than you had before you did the simulation.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.440]   - If you ask very specific questions,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   then you'll be able to create like very highly compressed,
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.600]   nice, beautiful theories about how things evolved.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.440]   And then you can use those to then generalize
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:20.680]   to other solar systems, to other stars and other galaxies,
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.080]   and then say something generalizable
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.680]   about the entire universe.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   How difficult would it be to simulate our solar system
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.860]   such that we would not know the difference?
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.680]   Meaning if we are living in a simulation,
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.800]   is there a nice, think of it as a video game,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.520]   is there a nice compressible way of doing that?
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.600]   Or just kind of like you intuited
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.480]   with a three body situation is just a giant mess
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.980]   that you cannot create a video game
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.840]   that will seem realistic
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.200]   without actually building your scratch.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.920]   - I'm speculating, but one of the,
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.780]   yeah, I know you have a deep understanding of this,
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:07.980]   but for me, I'm just gonna speculate that for,
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:13.520]   at least in the types of simulations that we can do today,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.180]   inevitably you run into the problem of resolution.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.400]   Doesn't matter what you're doing, it is discrete.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.340]   Now, the way you would go about asking,
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.260]   what we're observing, is that a simulation
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   or is that some real continuous thing,
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.460]   is you zoom in, right?
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:40.460]   You zoom in and try and find the grid scale, if you will.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:47.780]   Yeah, I mean, it's a really interesting question.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:54.500]   And because the solar system itself
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.760]   and really the double pendulum is chaotic, right?
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.720]   Pendulum sitting on another pendulum,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.620]   moves unpredictably once you let them go.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:10.600]   You really don't need to like inject any randomness
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.520]   into a simulation for it to give you stochastic
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.800]   and unpredictable answers.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.120]   Weather is a great example of this.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.160]   Weather has a lap of time of,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.800]   typical weather systems have a lap of time of a few days.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.640]   And there's a fundamental reason why the forecast
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.980]   always sucks, two weeks in advance.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.400]   It's not that we don't know the equations
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.080]   that govern the atmosphere, we know them well.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.360]   Their solutions are meaningless though, after a few days.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.200]   - The zooming in thing is very interesting.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.160]   I think about this a lot, whether there'll be a time soon
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.320]   where we would want to stay in video game worlds,
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.080]   whether it's virtual reality or just playing video games.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   - I mean, I think that time like came in like the 90s
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.600]   and it's been that time.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.400]   - Well, it's not just came, I mean, it's accelerated.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.680]   I just recently saw the wow and Fortnite
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.520]   were played 140 billion hours.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.160]   And those are just video games.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.200]   And that's like increasing very, very quickly,
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.400]   especially with the people coming up now,
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.600]   being born now and become teenagers and so on.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.760]   - Let's have a thought experiment where it's just you
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.320]   in a video game character inside a room,
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.520]   where you remove the simulation,
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:33.000]   they need to simulate sort of a lot of objects.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.920]   If it's just you and that character,
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.640]   how far do you need to simulate in terms of zooming in
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.760]   for it to be very real to you, as real as reality?
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.800]   So like, first of all, you kind of mentioned zooming in,
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.220]   which is fascinating because we have these tools of science
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.720]   that allow us to zoom in, quote unquote,
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.140]   in all kinds of ways in the world around us.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.680]   But our cognitive abilities,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.720]   like our perception system as humans
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.520]   is very limited in terms of zoom in.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.400]   So we might be very easily fooled.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.780]   - Some of the video games like on the PS4,
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.720]   like look pretty real to me, right?
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.360]   I think you would really have to interrogate.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.680]   I mean, I think even with what we have today,
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.640]   like, I don't know, Ace Combat 7 is a great example, right?
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.140]   Like, I mean, the way that the clouds are rendered,
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.340]   it's, I mean, it looks just like when you're flying,
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.140]   you know, on a real airplane, the kind of transparency.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.900]   I think that the, you know,
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.360]   our perception is limited enough already
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.980]   to not be able to tell some of the, you know,
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.240]   some of the differences.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.460]   There's a game called Skyrim.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.300]   It's an Elder Scrolls role-playing game.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.100]   And I just, I played it for quite a bit.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.600]   And I think I played it very different than others.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.860]   Like there'll be long stretches of time
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.900]   where I would just walk around
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.020]   and look at nature in the game.
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.540]   It's incredible.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.380]   - Oh, sure.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.940]   - It's just like the graphics is like, wow,
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.260]   I want to stay there.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.300]   It was better, I went hiking recently.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.800]   It was like as good as hiking.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.060]   - So look, I know what you mean.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.920]   Not to go on a huge video game tangent,
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.460]   but like the third Witcher game
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.240]   was astonishingly beautiful, right?
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.660]   Especially like playing on a good hardware machine.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.600]   It's like, this is pretty legit.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.400]   That said, you know,
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.520]   I don't resonate with the, I want to stay here.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.220]   You know, like one of the things that I love to do
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:48.220]   is to go to my like boxing gym and box with a guy, right?
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:52.840]   Like that's, there's nothing quite like that physical,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.940]   you know, experience.
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.780]   - That's fascinating.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:59.740]   That might be simply an artifact of the year you were born.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.580]   - Maybe.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.360]   - Because if you're born today,
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.280]   it almost seems like stupid to go to a gym.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.120]   - Yeah.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   - Like you go to a gym to box with a guy,
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.980]   why not box with Mike Tyson when you yourself,
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.260]   like in his prime, when you yourself
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.980]   are also an incredible boxer in the video game world.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.280]   - For me, there's a multitude of reasons
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.680]   why I don't want to box with Mike Tyson, right?
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.340]   Like I enjoy teeth, you know, and I want to have an ear.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.080]   - No, but your skills in this meat space,
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.320]   in this physical realm is very limited
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.460]   and takes a lot of work.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:37.460]   And you're a musician, you're an incredible scientist.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.220]   You only have so much time in the day,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.780]   but in the video game world,
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:45.420]   you can expand your capabilities in all kinds of dimensions
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.660]   that you can never have possibly have time
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:48.900]   in the physical world.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:53.300]   And so that, it doesn't make sense, like to be existing,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.300]   to be working your ass off in the physical world
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:58.620]   when you can just be super successful
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.300]   in the video game world.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.460]   - But I still--
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.180]   - You enjoy sucking at stuff?
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.020]   - Yeah, I really do.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.420]   - And struggling to get better?
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.340]   - I sure do.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.020]   I mean, I think like these days with music,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.340]   music is a great example, right?
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:17.340]   We just started practicing live with my band again,
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.860]   after not playing for a year.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.820]   And it was terrible, right?
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.980]   We were just kind of a lot of the nuance,
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.340]   a lot of the detail is just that detail that takes
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:34.300]   years of collective practice to develop, it's just lost.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   But it was just an incredible amount of fun,
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.940]   way more fun than all the like studio,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.500]   sitting around and playing that I did
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.180]   throughout the entire year.
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.860]   So I think there's something intangible
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.860]   or maybe tangible about being in person.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.540]   I sure hope you're wrong in that,
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.140]   that's not something that will get lost
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.220]   because I think there's like such a large part
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:06.180]   of the human condition is to hang out.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:11.060]   - If we were doing this interview on Zoom, right?
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:15.060]   I mean, I'd already be bored out of my mind.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:18.220]   - Exactly, I mean, there's something to that.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.060]   I mean, I'm almost playing devil's advocate,
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.820]   but at the same time, I'm sure people talk
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.020]   about the same way at the beginning of the 20th century
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:30.020]   about horses, where they are much more efficient,
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.260]   they're much easier to maintain than cars.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.700]   It doesn't make sense to have,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.140]   all the ways that cars break down
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.860]   and there's not enough infrastructure
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.740]   in terms of roads for cars.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.260]   It doesn't make any sense, like horses and like nature,
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.500]   you could do the nature, like where,
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.340]   you should be living more natural life.
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:49.380]   Those are real, you don't want machines in your life
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.900]   that are going to pollute your mind
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.620]   and the minds of young people,
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.260]   but then eventually just cars took over.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.820]   So in that same way, it just seems-
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.620]   - Going back to horses, I'm just, you know.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.140]   - Well, you can be, you can play, what is it?
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.740]   Red Dead.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.780]   - Red Dead Redemption, yeah.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.460]   - Redemption and you can ride horses in the video game.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.300]   - That's true.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.900]   - So let me return us back to planet nine.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.780]   - Always a good place to come back to.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.300]   - So now that we did a big historical overview
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.080]   of our solar system, what is planet nine?
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:26.020]   - Okay, planet nine is a hypothetical object
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.500]   that orbits the solar system, right?
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.580]   At an orbital period of about 10,000 years
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.220]   and an orbit which is slightly tilted
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.660]   with respect to the plane of the solar system,
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.860]   slightly eccentric and the object itself,
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.420]   we think is five times more massive than the earth.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.540]   We have never seen planet nine in a telescope,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   but we have gravitational evidence for it.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.420]   - And so this is where all the stuff
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.940]   we've been talking about, this clustering ideas,
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.500]   maybe you can speak to the approximate location
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.780]   that we suspect and also the question I wanted to ask
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.500]   is what are we supposed to be imagining here?
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.100]   'Cause you said there's certain objects
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.140]   in the Kuiper belt that are kind of have a direction
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.060]   to them that they're all like flocking
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.240]   in some kind of way.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.780]   So that's the sense that there's some kind
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.840]   of gravitational object not changing their orbit,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.940]   but kind of--
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.140]   - Confining them, right?
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.980]   - Yeah.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.100]   - Like grouping their orbits together.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.060]   See what would happen if planet nine were not there
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.420]   is these orbits that roughly share a common orientation,
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.820]   they would just disperse, right?
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.580]   They would just become as a mutually symmetric
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.500]   point everywhere.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   Planet nine's gravity makes it such that these objects
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.660]   stay in a state that's basically anti-aligned
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.260]   with respect to the orbit of planet nine
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.140]   and sort of hang out there and kind of oscillate
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.420]   on timescale of about a billion years.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:01.620]   That's one of the lines of evidence
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.300]   for the existence of planet nine.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.140]   There are others.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.300]   That's the one that's easiest to maybe visualize
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.100]   just because it's fun to think about orbits
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.740]   that all point into the same direction.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.140]   But I should emphasize that, for example,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:19.020]   the existence of objects, again, Kuiper belt objects
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.600]   that are heavily out of the plane of the solar system,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.260]   things that are tilted by say 90 degrees,
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.740]   that's not, we don't expect that as an outcome
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.900]   of planet formation.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.820]   Indeed, planet formation simulations have never produced
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.820]   such objects without some extrinsic gravitational force.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.540]   Planet nine, on the other hand, generates them very readily.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:45.300]   So that provides kind of an alternative population
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:49.660]   of small bodies in the solar system
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.260]   that also get produced by planet nine
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.140]   through an independent kind of gravitational effect.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:58.340]   So there's basically five different things
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.880]   that planet nine does individually
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.020]   that are like kind of maybe a one sigma effect
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.260]   where you'd say, yeah, okay, if that's all it was,
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.260]   maybe it's no reason to jump up and down.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:16.180]   But because it's a multitude of these puzzles
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.900]   that all are explained by one hypothesis,
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.260]   that's really the magnetism,
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.360]   the attraction of the planet nine model.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:30.300]   - So can you just clarify, so most planets
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:34.740]   in the solar system orbit at approximately the same,
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.660]   so it's flat.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.300]   - Yeah, it's like one degree.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.460]   The difference between them is about one degree.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.580]   - But nevertheless, if we looked at our solar system,
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.220]   it would look, and I could see every single object,
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.980]   it would look like a sphere.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.980]   The inner part where the planets are would look like flat.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:59.780]   The Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt have a larger--
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.500]   - It gets fatter and fatter and fatter
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.660]   and it becomes a sphere.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.340]   - That's right, and if you look at the very outside,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:11.060]   it's polluted by this quasi-spheroidal thing.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.580]   Nobody's, of course, ever seen the Oort cloud.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.220]   We've only seen comets that come from the Oort cloud.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.940]   So the Oort cloud, which is this population
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:26.260]   of distant debris, its existence is also inferred.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:31.260]   You could say alternatively, there's a big cosmic creature
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.900]   that occasionally, sitting at 20,000 AU
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.900]   and occasionally throws an icy rock towards the sun.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.980]   - Spaghetti monster, I think it's called.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.140]   Okay, so it's a mystery in many ways,
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.100]   but you can kind of infer a bunch of things about it.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.060]   By the way, both terrifying and exciting
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.540]   that there's this vast darkness all around us
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.020]   that's full of objects that are just throwing--
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.460]   - Just there, yeah.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.340]   It's actually kind of astonishing
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:02.340]   that we have only explored a small fraction
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.700]   of the solar system.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:08.980]   That really kind of baffles me because,
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.380]   remember as a student studying physics,
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   you do the problem where you put the Earth around the sun,
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.820]   and you solve that, and it's one line of math,
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.660]   and you say, "Okay, well that surely
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.380]   "was figured out by Newton."
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.020]   So all the interesting stuff is not in the solar system,
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.700]   but that, it's just plainly not true.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.420]   There are mysteries in the solar system
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:38.060]   that are remarkable that we are only now starting
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.340]   to just kind of scratch the surface of.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.100]   - And some of those objects probably have some information
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.860]   about the history of our solar system.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.420]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.220]   Like a great example is small meteorites.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.620]   Small meteorites are melted.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.060]   They're differentiated, meaning some of the iron sinks,
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.060]   and you say, "Well, how can that be?"
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.140]   'Cause they're so small that they wouldn't have melted
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.260]   just from the heat of their accretion.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.300]   Turns out the fact that the solar nebula,
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:12.220]   the disk that made the planets, was polluted by aluminum-26
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.900]   is in itself a remarkable thing.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.580]   It means the solar system did not form in isolation.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:21.940]   It formed in a giant cloud of thousands of other stars
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.260]   that were also forming, some of which were undergoing,
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.660]   going through supernova explosions,
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.540]   and releasing these unstable isotopes
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.900]   of which we now see kind of the traces of.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.060]   It's so cool.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.700]   - Do you think it's possible that life
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.460]   from other solar systems was injected
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.900]   and that was what was the origin of life on Earth?
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.620]   - Yeah, the Panspermia idea.
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.580]   - That's seen as a low probability event
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.340]   by people who studied the origin of life,
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.620]   but that's because then they would be out of a job.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.780]   (laughs)
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.540]   - Well, I don't think they'd be out of the job,
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.260]   'cause you just then have to figure out
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.180]   how life started there.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.360]   - But then you have to go there.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.700]   We can study life on Earth much easier.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.660]   We could study it in the lab much easier
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.340]   because we could replicate conditions
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.580]   that are from an early Earth much easier
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.700]   from a chemistry perspective, from a biology perspective.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.100]   You can intuit a bunch of stuff.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.620]   You can look at different parts of Earth.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.540]   - To an extent.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.740]   I mean, the early Earth was completely unlike
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.720]   the current Earth, right?
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.900]   There was no oxygen.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.860]   So, one of my colleagues at Caltech,
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.660]   Joe Kirshnick, is certain,
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.380]   something like 100% certainty
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.420]   that life started on Mars and came to Earth
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.760]   on Martian meteorites.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.980]   This is not a problem that I like to kind of
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.900]   think about too much.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.740]   Like the origin of life, it's a fascinating problem,
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.740]   but it's not physics, and I just don't love it.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.060]   - It's the same reason you don't love,
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.500]   I thought you're a musician.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.420]   So, music is not physics either,
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.260]   so why are you so into it?
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.740]   - It's 100% physics.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.260]   (laughing)
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.220]   - Yeah, no, no, look, in all seriousness, though,
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.900]   there are a few things that I really, really enjoy.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.340]   I genuinely enjoy physics.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.900]   I genuinely enjoy music.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.420]   I genuinely enjoy martial arts,
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.500]   and I genuinely enjoy my family.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.300]   I should have said that all in a reverse order or something,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.540]   but I like to focus on these things
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.780]   and not worry too much about everything else.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:40.620]   You know what I mean?
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.440]   - Yes.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.620]   - Just because there is, like you said earlier,
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.780]   there's a time constraint.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.340]   You can't do it all.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.340]   - There's many mysteries all around us,
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:53.360]   and they're all beautiful in different ways.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.180]   To me, that thing I love is artificial intelligence,
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.500]   that perhaps I love it because eventually
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.820]   I'm trying to suck up to our future overlords.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.380]   The question of, you said there's a lot of kind of,
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:10.500]   little pieces of evidence for this thing that's Planet Nine.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   If we were to try to collect more evidence
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:18.140]   or be certain, like a paper that says,
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.620]   like you drop it, clear, we're done,
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.100]   what does that require?
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.420]   Does that require us sending probes out,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.320]   or do you think we can do it from telescopes here on Earth?
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.660]   What are the different ideas
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.880]   for conclusive evidence for Planet Nine?
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.980]   - The moment Planet Nine gets imaged
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.860]   from a telescope on Earth, it's done.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.940]   I mean, it's just there.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.460]   - Can you clarify, 'cause you mentioned that before,
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.940]   from an image, would you be able to tell?
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   - Yes, so from an image, the moment you see something,
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.980]   something that is reflecting sunlight back at you,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.800]   and you know that it's hundreds of times
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.380]   as far away from the sun as is the Earth, you're done.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.020]   - So you're thinking, so basically,
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.500]   if you have a really far away thing that's big,
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   five times the size of Earth, that means that's Planet Nine.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.860]   - That is Planet Nine.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.180]   - Could there be multiple objects like that, I guess?
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.140]   - In principle, yeah.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.100]   I mean, there's no law of physics
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.500]   that doesn't allow you to have multiple objects.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.700]   There's also no evidence present
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.540]   for there being multiple objects.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.060]   - I wonder if it's possible,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.780]   so just like we're finding exoplanets,
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.340]   whether given the size of the Oort cloud,
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.780]   there's basically, it's rarer and rarer,
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.420]   but there's sprinkled Planet Nine, 10, 11, 12,
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.100]   like these, some--
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.580]   - Got 13.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:43.420]   - Yeah, it goes after that.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.100]   I can just keep counting.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.320]   So like, just something about the dynamic system,
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.580]   like it becomes lower and lower probability event,
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.340]   but they gather up, like they become,
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.780]   would they become larger and larger maybe?
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.100]   Something like that.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.060]   I wonder, I wonder if like discovering Planet Nine
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.300]   will just like be almost like a springboard,
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.500]   it's like, well, what's beyond that?
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.740]   - It's entirely plausible.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.100]   The Oort cloud itself probably holds about five Earth masses
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.860]   or seven Earth masses of material, right?
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.500]   So it's not nothing.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   And it all ultimately comes down to,
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.020]   at what point will the observational surveys
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.660]   sample enough of the solar system
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:32.860]   to kind of reveal interesting things?
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:36.220]   There's a great analogy here with Neptune
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.140]   and the story of how Neptune was discovered.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.020]   Neptune was not discovered by looking at the sky, right?
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.340]   It was discovered by, it was discovered mathematically,
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:49.460]   right, so yeah, the orbit of Uranus,
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.460]   when Uranus was found, this was 1781,
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.020]   it's the kind of tracking of,
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.580]   both the tracking of the orbit of Uranus
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.900]   as well as the reconstruction of the orbit of Uranus
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.260]   immediately revealed that it was not following the orbit
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.780]   that it was supposed to, right?
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.020]   The predicted orbit deviated away
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.820]   from where it actually was.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.820]   So in the mid 1800s, right, a French mathematician
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.340]   by the name of Orban Le Verrier
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:25.780]   did a beautifully sophisticated calculation
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:29.220]   which said if this is due to gravity
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:33.920]   of a more distant planet, then that planet is there, okay?
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.380]   And then they found it.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.420]   But the point is the understanding of where to look
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:43.580]   for Neptune came entirely out of celestial mechanics.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.900]   The case with planet nine is a little bit different
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.700]   because what we can do, I think, relatively well
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.020]   is predict the orbit and mass of planet nine.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.700]   We cannot tell you where it is on its orbit.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.900]   The reason is we haven't seen the Kuiper belt objects
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:02.620]   complete an orbit, their own orbit, even once
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.520]   because it takes 4,000 years.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.640]   But I plan to live on as an AI being,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.980]   and I'll be tracking those orbits as--
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.940]   - It only takes four or 5,000 years.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.140]   I mean, it doesn't have to be AI, it could be longevity.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.340]   There's a lot of really exciting
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.940]   genetic engineering research.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.260]   So you'll just be a brain waiting for the,
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.740]   (laughs)
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.940]   your brain waiting for the orbit to complete
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.260]   for the basic Kuiper belt objects.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.100]   - That's right, that's like kind of the worst reason
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.180]   to want to live a long time, right?
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.500]   Just like, can the brain smoke a cigarette?
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.340]   - I know, right?
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.020]   - Can you just light one up while you're waiting?
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:45.380]   - But you're making me actually realize
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.380]   that the one way to explore the galaxy
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:54.560]   is by just sitting here on earth and waiting.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.340]   So if we can just get really good at waiting,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.900]   it's like a muamua or these interstellar objects
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.780]   that fly in, you can just wait for them to come to you.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.340]   Same with the aliens, you can wait for them to come to you.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.040]   If you get really good at waiting,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.900]   then that's one way to do the exploration
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:12.460]   'cause eventually the thing will come to you.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.980]   Maybe the intelligent alien civilizations
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.060]   get much better at waiting and so they all decide,
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.700]   so again, theoretically, to start waiting
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.500]   and it's just a bunch of ancient intelligent civilizations
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.420]   of aliens all throughout the universe
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.300]   that are just sitting there waiting for each other.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.740]   - Look, you can't just be good at waiting,
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.420]   you gotta know how to chill.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:36.220]   Like, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.300]   You gotta know how to chill.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.700]   - I honestly think that as we progress,
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.500]   if the aliens are anything like us,
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.820]   we enjoy loving things we do
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:50.580]   and it's very possible that we just figure out mechanisms
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:53.860]   here on earth to enjoy our life
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.420]   and we just stay here on earth forever
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.900]   that exploration becomes less and less
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.300]   of an interesting thing to do.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.380]   And so you basically, yes, wait and chill.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.700]   You get really optimally good at chilling
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:09.340]   and thereby exploring is not that interesting.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:13.060]   So in terms of 4,000 years, it'll be nothing for scientists.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.940]   We'll be chilling and just all kinds
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:18.120]   of scientific explorations will become possible
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.980]   because we'll just be here on earth.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.820]   - So chill.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.660]   - So chill.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.580]   - So chill.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.940]   - You have a paper out recently
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.780]   'cause you already mentioned some of these ideas
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:27.820]   but I'd love it if you could dig into it a little bit.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:28.660]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.460]   - The injection of inner Oort cloud objects
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.700]   into the distant Kuiper belt by planet nine.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.740]   What is this idea of planet nine injecting objects
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.820]   into the Kuiper belt?
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.540]   - Okay, let me take a brief step back
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.500]   and when we do calculations of planet nine,
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.780]   when we do the simulations,
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.500]   as far as our simulations are concerned,
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:56.620]   sort of the Neptune,
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.540]   trans-Neptunian solar system
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.860]   is entirely sourced from the inside,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.700]   namely the Kuiper belt gets scattered by Neptune
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.660]   and then planet nine does things to it
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.860]   and aligns the orbits and so on.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.820]   And then we calculate what happens
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.300]   on the lifetime of the solar system, yada, yada, yada.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.300]   During the pandemic,
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.260]   one of the kind of questions we asked ourselves,
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.500]   and this is indeed something Mike and I,
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.060]   Mike Brown, who's a partner in crime on this,
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.780]   and I do regularly is we say,
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   how can we, A, disprove ourselves
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:39.220]   and B, how can we improve our simulations?
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.740]   Like what's missing?
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:45.100]   One idea that maybe should have been obvious in retrospect
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.100]   is that all of our simulations treated the solar system
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.700]   as some isolated creature, right?
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.380]   But the solar system did not form in isolation, right?
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:55.820]   It formed in this cluster of stars
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:59.140]   and during that phase of forming together
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.100]   with thousands of other stars,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.620]   we believe the solar system formed
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.980]   this almost spherical population of icy debris
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:12.980]   that sits maybe at a few thousand times
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.460]   the separation between the earth and the sun,
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.380]   maybe even a little bit closer.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.540]   If planet nine's not there,
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.780]   that population is completely dormant
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:29.300]   and these objects just slowly orbit the sun,
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.660]   nothing interesting happens to them ever.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.260]   But what we realized is that if planet nine is there,
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.780]   planet nine can actually grab some of those objects
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.060]   and gravitationally re-inject them
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.620]   into the distant solar system.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.580]   So we thought, okay, let's look into this
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.300]   with numerical experiments.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.180]   Do our simulations, does this process work?
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.940]   And if it works, what are its consequences?
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:57.060]   So it turns out, indeed, not only does planet nine
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:02.060]   inject these distant inner Oort cloud objects
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.660]   into the Kuiper belt,
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.740]   they follow roughly the same pathway
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.860]   as the objects that are being scattered out.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.980]   So there's this kind of two-way river of material.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.380]   Some of it is coming out by Neptune scattering,
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.300]   some of it is moving in.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.220]   And if you work through the numbers,
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.780]   you kind of, at the end of the day,
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.700]   that it has an effect on the best fit orbit
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:29.940]   for planet nine itself.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.780]   So if you realize that the dataset that we're observing
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.940]   is not entirely composed of things
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:37.460]   that came out of the solar system,
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.500]   but also things that got re-injected back in,
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.420]   then turns out the best fit planet nine
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.980]   is slightly more eccentric.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.700]   That's kind of getting into the weeds.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:50.700]   The point here is that the existence of planet nine itself
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.460]   provides this natural bridge that connects
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:57.020]   an otherwise dormant population of icy debris
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.660]   of the solar system with things
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.340]   that we're starting to directly observe.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.260]   - So it can flow back,
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.020]   so it's not just the river flowing one way,
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.500]   it's maybe a smaller stream go back.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.580]   - It's backwash.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.540]   - You want a backwash.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.860]   You want to incorporate that into the simulations,
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.580]   into your understanding of those distant objects
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.620]   when you're trying to make sense
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.540]   of the various observations and so on.
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.500]   - Exactly. - That's fascinating.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.060]   I gotta ask you, some people think
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:24.460]   that many of the observations that you're describing
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.100]   could be described by a primordial black hole.
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:31.220]   First, what is a primordial black hole,
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.620]   and what do you think about this idea?
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:36.460]   - Yeah, so a primordial black hole is a black hole
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.140]   which is made not through the usual pathway
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.780]   of making a black hole, which is that you have a star,
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   which is more massive than 1.4 or so solar masses.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.700]   And basically when it runs out of fuel,
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:56.140]   runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel,
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.340]   it can't hold itself up anymore,
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.380]   and just the whole thing collapses on itself.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.660]   Right, and you create a,
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:08.020]   I mean, one, I guess, simple way to think about it
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.980]   is you create an object with zero radius
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.540]   that has mass but zero radius, singularity.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.980]   Now, such black holes exist all over the place.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.820]   In the galaxy, there's in fact a really big one
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.180]   at the center of the galaxy.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.900]   - That one terrifies me.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.460]   - That one's always looking at you
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.220]   when you're not looking, okay?
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.820]   Right, and it's always talking about you.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.660]   - And when you turn off the lights, it wakes up.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:35.500]   - That's right.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.460]   But you know, so such black holes are all over the place.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:44.020]   When they merge, we get to see incredible gravitational waves
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.360]   that they emit, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.860]   One kind of plausible scenario, however,
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.420]   is that when the universe was forming,
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.460]   basically during the Big Bang,
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:57.460]   you created a whole spectrum of black holes,
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:00.060]   some with masses of five Earth masses,
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:02.180]   some with masses of 10 Earth masses,
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.540]   like the entire mass spectrum size,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.820]   some the mass of asteroids.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.100]   Now, on the smaller end, over the lifetime of the universe,
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.480]   the smaller ones kind of evaporate
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.760]   and they're not there anymore.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.380]   At least this is what the calculations tell us.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:24.960]   But five Earth masses is big enough to not have evaporated.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.720]   So one idea is that planet nine is not a planet,
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.820]   and instead it is a five Earth mass black hole.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.920]   And that's why it's hard to find.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.920]   Now, can we right away from our calculations,
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.900]   say that's definitely true or that's not true?
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.900]   Absolutely not.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:50.180]   We can't, in fact, our calculations tell you nothing
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.540]   other than the orbit and the mass.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.300]   And that means the black hole,
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.660]   I mean, it could be a five Earth mass cup,
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.900]   it could be a five Earth mass hedgehog or a black hole,
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.340]   or really anything that's five Earth masses will do
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.640]   because the gravity of a black hole
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.660]   is no different than the gravity of a planet.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:14.640]   If the sun became a black hole tomorrow,
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.920]   it would be dark, but the Earth would keep orbiting it.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.860]   This notion that, oh, black holes suck everything in,
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.500]   it's not, that's like a sci-fi notion.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.460]   - Right, it's just math.
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:28.180]   What would be the difference between a black hole
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:32.100]   and a planet in terms of observationally?
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.020]   - Observationally, the difference would be
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.020]   that you will never find the black hole.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:39.020]   The truth is they're kind of,
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:43.460]   I'm actually not, I never looked into this very carefully,
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.540]   but there are some constraints
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.540]   that you can get just statistically and say,
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.820]   okay, if the sun has a binary companion,
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:55.380]   which is a five Earth mass black hole,
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.880]   then that means such black holes would be extremely common.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.540]   And you can sort of look for lensing events
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:05.080]   and then you say, okay, maybe that's not so likely.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.220]   But that said, I wanna emphasize
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.780]   that there's a limit to what our calculations can tell you.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.540]   That's the orbit and the mass.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.300]   - So I think there's a bunch, like Ed Witten,
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:20.620]   I think, wishes it's a black hole.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.300]   Because I think one exciting things about black holes
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:26.700]   in our solar system is that we can go there
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.500]   and we can maybe study the singularity somehow,
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.980]   because that allows us to understand
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.140]   some fundamental things about physics.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:37.900]   If it's a planet, so planet nine, we may not,
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.980]   and we go there, we may not discover
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.020]   anything profoundly new.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.140]   The interesting thing, perhaps you can correct me,
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:48.340]   about planet nine is like the big picture of it.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.740]   The whole big story of the Kuiper belt
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.100]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.540]   It's not that planet nine would be somehow
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:59.540]   fundamentally different from, I don't know, Neptune,
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.820]   in terms of the kind of things we could learn from it.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.520]   So I think that there's kind of a hope
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.700]   that it's a black hole because it's an entirely
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.820]   new kind of object.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.620]   Maybe you can correct me.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.220]   - Yeah, I mean, of course, here my own biases creep in
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:19.740]   because I'm interested in planets around other stars.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:24.580]   And I would say, I would disagree that we wouldn't find
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:29.020]   things that would be truly fundamentally new.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:33.740]   Because as it turns out, the galaxy is really good
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.620]   at making five or three Earth-mass objects.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   The most common type of planet that we see,
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.080]   that we discover orbiting around other stars
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.720]   is a few Earth masses.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.980]   In the solar system, there's no analog for that.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.180]   We go from one Earth-mass object, which is this one,
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.860]   to skipping to Neptune and Uranus,
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.780]   which themselves are actually relatively poorly understood,
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:03.240]   especially Uranus from the interior structure point of view.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.480]   If planet nine is a planet, going there will give us
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.600]   the closest window into understanding
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.840]   what other planets look like.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.840]   And I'll say this, that planets,
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.720]   kind of in terms of their complexity
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.120]   on some logarithmic scale, fall somewhere
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.920]   between a star and an insect.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.780]   An insect is way more complicated than a star.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.560]   There's all kinds of physical processes
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.560]   and really biochemical processes that occur
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   inside of an insect that just make a star look like
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.840]   somebody is playing with a spring or something.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:52.200]   I think it would be arguably more interesting
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:57.920]   to go to planet nine if it's a planet,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.240]   'cause black holes are simple.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.920]   They're just kind of, they're basically
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.640]   macroscopic particles.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.480]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.160]   - Just like the star that you mentioned
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.000]   in terms of complexity.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.600]   So it's possible that planet nine,
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.120]   as opposed to being homogeneous, is super,
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.280]   heterogeneous, there's a bunch of cool stuff going on.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.720]   - Absolutely. - That could give us
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.280]   intuition, I never thought about that,
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.440]   that it's just basically Earth number two
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.560]   in terms of size, and starts giving us intuition
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.040]   that could be generalizable to Earth-like planets
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.520]   elsewhere in the galaxy.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.080]   - Yeah, Pluto is also, in the sense,
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.000]   like Pluto's a tiny, tiny thing, right?
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.200]   Just like you would imagine that it's just
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.080]   a tiny ball of ice, like who cares?
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.960]   But in the New Horizons, images of Pluto
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.240]   reveal so much remarkable structure, right?
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.140]   They reveal glaciers flowing, and these are glaciers
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.400]   not made out of water ice, but CO ice.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.280]   It turns out, at those temperatures,
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.920]   right, of like 40 or so Kelvin,
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.640]   water ice looks like metal, right?
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:04.000]   It just doesn't flow at all, but then ice made up
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.360]   of carbon monoxide starts to flow.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.280]   I mean, there's just like all kinds of really cool
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.200]   phenomena that you otherwise just wouldn't
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.060]   really even imagine that occur.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:20.400]   So, yeah, I mean, there's a reason why I like planets.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.480]   (laughing)
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:26.280]   - Well, let me ask you, I find, as I read,
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.620]   the idea that Ed Witten was thinking about
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.980]   this kind of stuff fascinating.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.440]   So he's a mathematical physicist
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.840]   who's very interested in string theory,
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   won the Fields Medal for his work in mathematics.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.640]   So I read that he proposed a fleet of probes
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.960]   accelerated by radiation pressure
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.640]   that could discover a planet nine
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.680]   primordial black holes location.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.640]   What do you think about this idea
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.080]   of sending a bunch of probes out there?
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.720]   - Yeah, look, the way, the idea is a cool one, right?
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.320]   You go and you say, you know,
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.280]   launch them basically isotropically,
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.320]   you track where they go, and if I understand
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.480]   the idea correctly, you basically measure
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.080]   the deflection and you say, okay,
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.080]   that must be something there since the probe trajectory
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.680]   are being altered.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.360]   - Oh, so the measurement, the basic sensory mechanism
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.240]   is the, it's not like you have senses on the probes,
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.520]   it's more like you're, because you're very precisely
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.480]   able to capture, to measure the trajectory of the probes,
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.640]   you can then infer the gravitational fields.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.320]   - Yeah, I think that's the basic idea.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.760]   You know, back a few years ago,
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.760]   we had conversations like these with, you know,
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:50.320]   engineers from JPL, they more or less convinced me
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.560]   that this is much more difficult than it seems
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.560]   because you don't, at that level of precision, right,
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.680]   things like solar flares matter, right?
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.680]   Solar flares, right, are completely chaotic,
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.080]   you can't predict which, where a solar flare will happen,
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.480]   that will drive radiation pressure gradients,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.560]   you don't know where every single asteroid is,
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:17.400]   so like actually doing that problem,
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:21.600]   I think it's possible, but it's not a trivial matter, right?
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.360]   - Well, I wonder not just about Planet Nine,
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.080]   I wonder if that's kind of the future of doing science
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.920]   in our solar system, is to just launch
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.000]   a huge number of probes, so like a whole order of magnitude,
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.680]   many orders of magnitude larger numbers of probes,
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.440]   and then start to infer a bunch of different stuff,
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.480]   not just gravity, but everything else.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   - So in this regard, I actually think
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.640]   there is a huge revolution that's,
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.040]   to some extent, already started, right?
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:55.520]   The standard kind of like time scale for a NASA mission
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.800]   is that you like propose it and it launches,
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.960]   I don't know, like 150 years after you propose it,
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.120]   I'm over-exaggerating, but you know,
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.800]   it's just like some huge development cycle,
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.320]   and it gets delayed 55 times,
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:15.800]   like that is not going away, right?
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.120]   The really cutting edge things,
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.240]   you have to do it this way because you don't know
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.000]   what you're building, so to speak.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   But the CubeSat kind of world is starting to, you know,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.080]   provide an avenue for like launching something
[01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.400]   that costs, you know, a few million dollars
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.920]   and has a turnaround time scale of like a couple years.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.080]   You can imagine doing, you know, PhD theses,
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.120]   where you design the mission,
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.840]   the mission goes to where you're going,
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.760]   and you do the science all within a time span
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.080]   of five, six years.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:53.560]   That has not been fully executed on yet,
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.000]   but I absolutely think that's on the horizon,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.880]   and we're not talking a decade.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.280]   I think we're talking like this decade.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.400]   - Yeah, and the company's accelerating all this
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:07.440]   with Blue Origin and SpaceX,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.120]   and there's a bunch of more CubeSat-oriented companies
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.120]   that are pushing this forward.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:15.080]   Well, let me ask you on that topic,
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.760]   what do you think about either one?
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.880]   Elon Musk with SpaceX going to Mars,
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.800]   I think he wants SpaceX to be the first,
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.360]   to put a first human on Mars.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:31.280]   And then Jeff Bezos, got to give him props,
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.400]   wants to be the first to fly his own rocket
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.640]   out into space, so.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:42.240]   - Wasn't there a guy who built his rocket out of garbage?
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.080]   - Yeah.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.840]   - This was a couple years ago,
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.600]   and somewhere in the desert, he launched himself.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.760]   - I'm not tracking this closely,
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.800]   but I think I am familiar with folks
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.840]   who built their own rocket
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.560]   to try to prove the Earth is flat.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.040]   - Yes, that's the guy I'm talking about.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.820]   Yeah, he also jumped some limousine.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.960]   - Truly revolutionary mind.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.800]   - That's right.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.400]   - You have greater men than either you or I.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.080]   But what do you--
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.400]   - So look, it's been astonishing to watch
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.200]   how really over the last decade,
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.200]   the commercial sector took over this industry
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.680]   that traditionally has really been
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.700]   like a government thing to do.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:30.280]   - Motivated primarily by the competition
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.560]   between nations, like the Cold War.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.280]   And now it's motivated more and more
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.720]   by the natural forces of capitalism.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.040]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:43.880]   So, okay, here I have many ideas about it.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.440]   I think on the one hand, right,
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.720]   like what SpaceX has been able to do,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.080]   for example, phenomenal.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:55.040]   If that brings down the price of SpaceX,
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.900]   wouldn't that turn around timescale for space exploration,
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.660]   which I think it inevitably will,
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.040]   that's a huge, you know,
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.480]   that's a huge boost to the human condition.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.320]   The same time, right, if we're talking astronomy,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.200]   right, there also, it comes at a huge cost, right?
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.760]   And the Starlink satellites is a great example
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.640]   of that cost, right?
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:20.480]   At one point, in fact, I was just camping
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.640]   in the Mojave with a friend of mine,
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:27.200]   and they saw, you know, this string of satellites
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.200]   just kind of like, you know,
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.360]   appear and then disappear into nowhere.
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.560]   So, that is beginning to interfere with, you know,
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.040]   Earth-based observations.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.040]   So, I think there's tremendous potential there.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.760]   It's also important to be responsible
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.880]   about how it's executed.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.800]   Now, with Mars and the whole idea of, you know,
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.960]   exploring Mars, right, I don't have like strong opinions
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   on whether a manned mission is required or not required,
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:04.060]   but I do think, you know, we need to focus,
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.900]   the thing to keep in mind is that I generally kind of,
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.220]   I'm not signed on, if you will, to the idea
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.420]   that Mars is some kind of a safe haven
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.780]   that we can, you know, escape to, right?
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:18.980]   Mars sucks, right?
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:22.500]   Like living on Mars, if you wanna live on Mars,
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.700]   like you can have that experience
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.340]   by going to the Mojave Desert and camping,
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:31.940]   and it's just like, it's just not a great--
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.380]   - Well, it's interesting, but there's something
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.220]   captivating about that kind of mission
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:37.420]   of us striving out into space,
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:42.420]   and by making Mars in some ways habitable
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.140]   for at least like months at a time,
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.420]   I think would lead to engineering breakthroughs
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:51.420]   that would make life like in many ways
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.260]   much better on Earth.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:56.280]   Like it will come up with ideas we totally don't expect yet,
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.340]   both on the robotic side, on the food engineering side,
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:03.980]   on the, you know, maybe like we'll switch from,
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:07.740]   like there'll be huge breakthroughs in insect farming,
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.000]   as exciting as I find that idea to be.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.580]   In the ways we consume protein,
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.140]   maybe it'll revolutionize, we do factory farming,
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.020]   which is full of cruelty and torture of animals,
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.020]   we'll revolutionize that completely because of our,
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.780]   like we don't, we shouldn't need to go to Mars
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:30.000]   to revolutionize life here on Earth,
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.500]   but at the same time, I shouldn't need a deadline
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:34.980]   to get shit done, but I do need it.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.440]   And then the same way, I think we need Mars.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.920]   There's something about the human spirit
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.080]   that loves that longing for exploration.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.800]   - I agree with that thesis.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.800]   Going to the moon, right, and that whole endeavor
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:53.920]   has, you know, has captivated the imagination of so many,
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.760]   and it has led to incredible kind of,
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.080]   incredible ideas really, and probably in nonlinear ways,
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.160]   right, not like, okay, we went to the moon,
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.680]   therefore, some person here has thought of this.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.360]   In that similar sense, I think, you know,
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.680]   space exploration is, there's something,
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.280]   there's some real magnetism about it,
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.400]   and it's on a genetic level, right?
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:21.240]   Like we have this need to keep exploring, right,
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.680]   when we're done with a certain frontier,
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.280]   we move on to the next frontier.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:30.040]   All that I'm saying is that I'm not moving to Mars
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.800]   to live there permanently ever, you know,
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.640]   and I think that, you know, I'm glad you noted
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.520]   the kind of degradation of the Earth, right?
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.600]   I think that is a true kind of leading order
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.000]   challenge of our time. - Yeah, it's a great
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.280]   engineering, it's a bunch of engineering problems.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.660]   I'm most interested in space 'cause,
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.060]   as I've read extensively, it's apparently very difficult
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:57.160]   to have sex in space, and so I just want that problem
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.580]   to be solved because I think once we solve
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.240]   the sex in space problem, we'll revolutionize sex
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.640]   here on Earth, thereby increasing the fun on Earth,
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.040]   and the consequences of that can only be good.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.360]   - I mean, you've got a clear plan, right?
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.360]   And it sounds like-- - I'm submitting proposals
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.160]   to NASA as we speak. - That's right.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.640]   (laughing)
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.560]   - I keep getting rejected, I don't know why.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.640]   - Okay. (laughing)
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.280]   - You need better diagrams. - Better pictures.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.520]   I should have thought of that.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.600]   You a while ago mentioned that, you know,
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.680]   there's certain aspects in the history
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.240]   of the solar system and Earth that resulted,
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.160]   it could have resulted in an opaque atmosphere,
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.660]   but it didn't, we couldn't see the stars.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:46.360]   And somebody mentioned to me a little bit ago,
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.160]   it's almost like a philosophical question for you,
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   do you think humans, like human society would develop
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:59.840]   as it did or at all if we couldn't see the stars?
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.880]   - It would be drastically different,
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.200]   just drastically, if it ever did develop.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.960]   So I think some of the early developments, right,
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.680]   of like-- - Fire.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.760]   - Fire, you know, first of all,
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.160]   that atmosphere would be so hot 'cause, you know,
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.960]   if you have an opaque atmosphere,
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.080]   the temperature at the bottom is huge.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.680]   So we would be very different beings to start with.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.080]   We'd have very different-- - But it could be cloudy
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.360]   in certain kinds of ways that you could still get--
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.400]   - Okay, think about like a greenhouse, right?
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   A greenhouse is cloudy, effectively, but it's super hot.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.120]   Yeah, it's hard to avoid having an atmosphere.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.200]   If you have an opaque atmosphere, it's hard to, right,
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.160]   Venus is a great example, right?
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.120]   Venus is, I don't remember exactly how many degrees,
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.920]   but it's hundreds in Celsius, right?
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.260]   It's not a hundred, it's hundreds.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.920]   Even though it's only a little bit closer to the sun,
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.320]   that temperature is entirely coming from the fact
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.740]   that the atmosphere is thick.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.800]   - So it's a sauna of sorts.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.760]   - Yeah, yeah, you go there, you know,
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.200]   you feel refreshed after you come back, you know.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.240]   - But if you stay there, I mean, so, okay,
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.960]   take that as an assumption.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.440]   This is a philosophical question, not a biological one.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.120]   So you have a life that develops
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.240]   under these extremely hot conditions.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.120]   - Yeah, so let's see, so much of the early evolution
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:28.120]   of mankind was driven by exploration, right?
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   And the kind of interest in stars originated in part
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.880]   as a tool to guide that exploration, right?
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.680]   I mean, that in itself, I think would be a huge,
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.040]   you know, a huge differential in the way that we,
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.000]   you know, our evolution on this planet.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.480]   - Yeah, I mean, stars, that's brilliant.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.020]   So even in that aspect, but even in further aspects,
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:40:00.040]   astronomy just shows up in basically every single
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.200]   development in the history of science
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.380]   up until the 20th century, it shows up.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:08.400]   So I wonder without that, if we would have,
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.480]   if we would even get like calculus.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.560]   - Yeah, look, that's a great, I mean, that's a great point.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.840]   Newton in part developed calculus because he was interested
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.480]   in understanding, explaining Kepler's laws, right?
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.600]   In general, that whole mechanistic understanding
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.960]   of the night sky, right, replacing a religious understanding
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.280]   where you interpret, you know, this is, you know,
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.600]   this whatever fire god riding his, you know,
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.880]   a little chariot across the sky as opposed to,
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.960]   you know, this is some mechanistic set of laws
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.960]   that transformed humanity and arguably put us on the course
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.500]   that we're on today, right?
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:54.000]   The entirety of the last 400 years and the development
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   of kind of our technological world that we live in today
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.920]   was sparked by that, right?
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.440]   Abandoning an effectively, you know, a non-secular view
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.360]   of the natural world and kind of saying,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.480]   "Okay, this can be understood,
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.840]   and if it can be understood, it can be utilized,
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.000]   we can create our own variants of this."
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.400]   Absolutely, we would be a very, very different species
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.440]   without astronomy.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.560]   This I think extends beyond just astronomy, right?
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.120]   There are questions like why do we need
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.000]   to spend money on X, right?
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.840]   Where X can be anything like paleontology, right?
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:42.400]   - The mating patterns of penguins.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.000]   - Yeah, that's like-- - Essential.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.440]   - That's right.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.180]   I think, you know, there's a tremendous underappreciation
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:55.160]   for the usefulness of useless knowledge, right?
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.520]   I mean-- - That's brilliant.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.520]   - I didn't come up with this.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:02.440]   This is a little book by the guy who started
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.280]   the Institute for Advanced Studies,
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.880]   but it's so true.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.920]   So much of the electronics that are on this table, right,
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.440]   work on Maxwell's equations.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:18.000]   Maxwell wasn't sitting around in the 1800s saying,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.720]   "I hope one day we'll make a couple of mics
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   so a couple of guys can have this conversation," right?
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.800]   That wasn't at no point was that the motivation,
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.800]   and yet, you know, it gave us the world that we have today.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.640]   And the answer is if you are a purely pragmatic person,
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.200]   if you don't care at all about kind of the human condition,
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:51.200]   none of this, the answer is you can tax it, right?
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:56.200]   Like useless things have created
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.640]   way more capital than useful things.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.440]   - And the SAT, I mean, first of all,
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.520]   it's really important to think about,
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.520]   and it's brilliant, in the following context.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.320]   Like Neil deGrasse Tyson has this book
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.080]   about the role of military-based funding
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.360]   in the development of science.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:21.520]   And then so much of technological breakthroughs
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.440]   in the 20th century had to do with humans working
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.320]   on different military things.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.120]   And then the outcome of that had nothing to do with military.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.520]   It had some military application,
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.760]   but their impact was much, much bigger than military.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.120]   - The splitting of the atom
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:41.480]   is kind of a canonical example of this.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.360]   We all know the tragedy that arises
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:48.280]   from splitting of the atom, and yet, you know, so much,
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:52.200]   I mean, the atom itself does not care
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.480]   for what purpose it is being split.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:57.320]   So, yeah. - So I wonder if we took
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.800]   the same amount of funding as we used for war
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:04.440]   and poured it into like totally seemingly useless things,
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.520]   like the mating patterns of penguins,
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.480]   we would get the internet anyway.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.280]   - I think so, I think so.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.440]   And, you know, perhaps more of the internet
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.520]   would have penguins, you know?
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.640]   - So we're both joking, but in some sense, like,
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.920]   I wonder, it's not the penguins,
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.560]   'cause penguins is more about sort of biology,
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.960]   but all useless kind of tinkering
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.680]   and all kinds of, in all kinds of avenues.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.080]   And also because military applications
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.040]   are often burdened by the secrecy required.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:45.040]   So it's often like so much, the openness is lacking.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:48.000]   And if we learned anything for the last few decades
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.120]   is that when there's openness in science
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.600]   that accelerates the development of science.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.200]   - That's right, that's true.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.040]   The openness of science truly, you know,
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.160]   it benefits everybody.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.760]   The notion that if, you know, I share my science with you,
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.520]   then you're gonna catch up and like know the same thing.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.600]   That is a short-sighted viewpoint,
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.400]   because if you catch up and you open, you know,
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.960]   you discover something,
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.680]   that puts me in a position to do the next step, right?
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.680]   It's just, so I absolutely agree with all of this.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.160]   I mean, the kind of question of like military funding
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.840]   versus non-military funding is obviously a complicated one.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.800]   But at the end of the day,
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   I think we have to get over the notion as a society
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.280]   that we are going to, you know, pay for this,
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:47.600]   and then we will get that, right?
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.520]   That's true if you're buying like, I don't know,
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.080]   toilet paper or something, right?
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.540]   It's just not true in the intellectual pursuit.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.520]   That's not how it works.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.360]   And sometimes it'll fail, right?
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:04.080]   Like sometimes like a huge fraction of what I do, right?
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.480]   I come up with an idea, I think, oh, it's great.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.760]   And then I work it out, it's totally not great, right?
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.240]   It fails immediately.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.400]   - Failure is not a sign
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.240]   that the initial pursuit was worthless.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.720]   Failure is just part of this kind of,
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.040]   this whole exploration thing.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.020]   And we should fund more and more of this exploration,
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.800]   the variety of the exploration.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.800]   - I think it was Linus Pauling or somebody from,
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.120]   you know, that generation of scientists said,
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.640]   you know, a good way to have good ideas
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.160]   is to have a lot of ideas.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.960]   So I think that's true.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:39.640]   If you are conservative in your thinking,
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.080]   if you worry about proposing something that's going to fail
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.180]   and oh, what if, you know, like,
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.240]   there's no science police that's gonna come and arrest you
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:51.640]   for proposing the wrong thing.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.920]   And, you know, it's also just like,
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   why would you do science if you're afraid of,
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.940]   you know, taking that step?
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.640]   It would be so much better to propose things
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.800]   that are plausible, they're interesting,
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.840]   and then for a fraction of them to be wrong
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.560]   than to just kind of, you know,
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.160]   make incremental progress all your life, right?
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.480]   - Speaking of wild ideas,
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.400]   let me ask you about the thing we mentioned previously,
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:21.720]   which is this interstellar object, Amu Amu.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:27.280]   Could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization?
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:30.340]   - You can't immediately discount that
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:33.480]   by saying absolutely it cannot.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.080]   Anything can be space junk.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.280]   I mean, from that point of view,
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.960]   can any of the Kuiper belt objects we see
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.920]   could be space junk?
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.800]   Anything on the night sky can in principle be space junk.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.160]   - And Kuiper belt would catch interstellar objects
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.100]   potentially and like force them into an orbit
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:51.840]   if they're like small enough?
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.640]   - Not the Kuiper belt itself,
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:55.880]   but you can imagine like Jupiter family comets
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:57.920]   being captured, you know,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.680]   so you can actually capture things.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:04.160]   It's even easier to do this very early in the solar system,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.000]   like early in the solar system's life
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.040]   while it's still in a cluster of stars.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.320]   It's unavoidable that you capture debris,
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.960]   whether it be natural debris or unnatural debris
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.760]   or just debris of some kind from other stars.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.320]   It's like a daycare center, right?
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.600]   Like everybody passes their infections onto other kids.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.480]   You know, Oumuamua, there's been a lot of discussion about,
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.160]   and there's been a lot of interest in this over,
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.800]   is it aliens or is it not?
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.840]   But let's, like, if you just kind of look at the facts,
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.780]   like what we know about it is it's kind of like a weird shape
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:44.720]   and it also accelerated, right?
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.440]   Like that's the two,
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.680]   those are the two interesting things about it.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.400]   There are puzzles about it
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.400]   and perhaps the most daring resolution to this puzzle
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.960]   is that it's not, you know, aliens or it's not like a rock,
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.680]   it's actually a piece of hydrogen ice.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.740]   So this is a friend of mine, you know,
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:16.400]   Daryl Seligman and Greg Laughlin came up with this idea
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.740]   where that in giant molecular clouds
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.660]   that are just clouds of hydrogen helium gas
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:26.360]   that live throughout the galaxy,
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.780]   at their cores, you can condense ice
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:33.740]   to become these hydrogen, you know, icebergs, if you will.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:37.740]   And then that explains many of the aspects
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.060]   of, in fact, I think that explains
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:45.540]   all of the Oumuamua mystery, how it becomes elongated
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:48.380]   because basically the hydrogen ice sublimates
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:51.260]   and kind of like a bar of soap that, you know,
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:55.860]   slowly kind of elongates as you strip away
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:00.500]   the surface layers, how it was able to accelerate
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.380]   because of a jet that is produced from, you know,
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:05.580]   the hydrogen coming off of it, but you can't see it
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.980]   'cause it's hydrogen gas, like all of this stuff
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.960]   kind of falls together nicely.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.860]   I'm intrigued by that idea, truly,
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:17.640]   because it's like, if that's true,
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.180]   that's a new type of astrophysical object.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.820]   - And it would be produced by,
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.900]   what's the monster that produced it initially,
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.260]   that kind of object?
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:30.420]   - So this is giant molecular clouds, they're everywhere.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:34.500]   I mean, they are, the fact that they exist is not--
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.740]   - Are they rogue clouds or are they part of like
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.580]   an oared cloud of another solar?
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:39.420]   - No, no, they're rogue clouds, yeah.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:40.720]   - They're just floating about?
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.380]   - Yeah, so if you go, like a lot of people imagine
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:48.380]   the galaxy as being a bunch of stars, right,
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:50.760]   and they're just orbiting, right,
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.780]   but the truth is if you fly between stars,
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:55.180]   you run into clouds.
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.260]   - That don't have any large object that creates orbits,
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.100]   they're just floating about.
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:00.020]   - They're just floating.
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.700]   - But why are they floating together?
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.940]   Are they just floating together for a time and not--
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:08.780]   - Well, so these eventually become the nurseries of stars.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:13.780]   So as they cool, they contract and then collapse
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.980]   into stars or into groups of stars.
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:20.980]   But some of them, the starless molecular clouds,
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.900]   according to the calculations that Daryl and Greg did
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:30.900]   can create these like icicles of hydrogen ice.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:33.460]   - I wonder why they would be flying so fast.
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.260]   'Cause they seem to be moving pretty fast at a quick pace.
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.100]   - You mean Oumuamua?
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:37.940]   - Oumuamua, yeah.
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.820]   - Oh, that's just because of the acceleration
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.420]   due to the sun.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:46.260]   If you stop, it's like, take something really far away,
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:48.140]   let it go, and the sun is here.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:50.540]   By the time it comes close to the sun, right,
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.900]   it's moving pretty fast.
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:56.060]   So that's an attractive explanation, I think,
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.680]   not so much because it's cool,
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.980]   but it makes a clear prediction, right,
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:05.980]   of when Vera Rubin Observatory comes online next year or so,
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:10.740]   we will discover many, many more of these objects, right?
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:15.740]   And they have, so I like theories that are falsifiable,
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:19.260]   and not just testable, but falsifiable.
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:21.240]   It's good to have a falsifiable theory
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.000]   where you can say that's not true.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.900]   Aliens is one that's fundamentally difficult
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:30.260]   to say, no, that's not aliens, right?
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:32.100]   - The interesting thing to me,
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.320]   if you look at one alien civilization,
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:37.660]   and then we look at the things it produces,
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:39.860]   in terms of if we were to try to detect
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:44.460]   the alien civilization, there's like,
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:47.860]   say there's 10 billion aliens,
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.420]   there would probably be
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:57.580]   trillions of dumb drone-type things produced by the aliens,
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:01.340]   and there'd be many, many, many more orders
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.400]   and magnitude of junk.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.740]   So like, if you were to look for an alien civilization,
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.700]   in my mind, you would be looking for the junk.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:12.260]   That's the more efficient thing to look for.
[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:15.860]   So I'm not saying Oumuamua has any characteristics
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:18.220]   of space junk, but it kind of opened my eyes
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:22.780]   like to the idea that we shouldn't necessarily be looking
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.420]   to the queen of the ant colony.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.700]   We should be looking at, I don't know.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.020]   I don't know, like traces of alien life
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.500]   that doesn't look intelligent in any way,
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.100]   may not even look like life.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.340]   It could be just garbage.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:39.540]   We should be looking for garbage.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.380]   - Just generically.
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:46.380]   - Garbage that's producible by unnatural forces.
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:49.020]   For me, at least, that was kind of interesting
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:52.900]   because if you have a successful alien civilization,
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:55.020]   that we would be producing many more orders
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.300]   and magnitude of junk, and that would be easier
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.700]   potentially to detect.
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.380]   - Well, so you have to produce the junk,
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.140]   but you have to also launch it.
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:05.620]   So this is where, I mean, let's imagine--
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:06.460]   - Garbage disposal.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:11.300]   - Yeah, but let's imagine we are a successful civilization
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.020]   that has made it to space.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:15.180]   We clearly have, right?
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.140]   And yes, we're in the infancy of that pursuit,
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:21.940]   but we've launched, I don't know how many satellites.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:26.100]   Probably if you count GPS satellites,
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.820]   it must be at least thousands.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.100]   - It's certainly thousands.
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.420]   I don't know if it's over 10,000, but it's on that order.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:34.860]   - But it's on that large order of magnitude.
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:37.620]   How many of the things that we've launched
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.500]   will ever leave the solar system?
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:40.940]   I think two.
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.780]   - It's two so far.
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:44.860]   - Well, maybe the Voyager, the Voyager 1, Voyager 2.
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:46.820]   I don't know if the Pioneer.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:48.180]   So maybe three.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.580]   - Oh, there's also a Tesla Roadster out there.
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:54.660]   - That one, it will never leave the solar system.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:57.340]   I think that one will eventually collide with Mars.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:55:00.700]   That can be SpaceX's first Mars destination.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:05.340]   But look, so there's an energetic cost
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:09.580]   to interstellar travel, which is really hard to overcome.
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.740]   And when we think about generically,
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:15.180]   what do we look for in an alien civilization?
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:18.820]   Oftentimes, we tend to imagine that the thing you look for
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:21.820]   is the thing that we're doing right now, right?
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:26.820]   So I think that if I look at the future, right?
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:30.220]   And for a while, like, okay, if aliens are out there,
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:33.100]   they must be broadcasting in radio, right?
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:37.980]   That radio, the amount that we broadcast in radio
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:42.860]   has diminished tremendously in the last 50 years,
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.700]   but we're doing a lot more computation, right?
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:49.300]   What are the signs of computation?
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:52.380]   Like, that's an interesting question to ask, right?
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.860]   Where, I don't know, I think something on the order
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:00.260]   of a few percent of the entire electrical grid last year
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.060]   went to mining Bitcoin, right?
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:07.780]   - Yeah, there could be a lot of, in the future,
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.740]   different consequences of the computation,
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:13.340]   which, I mean, I'm biased, but it could be robotics,
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.700]   it could be artificial intelligence.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:19.700]   So we may be looking for intelligent-looking objects,
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:22.500]   like that's what I meant by probes,
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.260]   like things that move in kind of artificial ways.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.780]   - But the emergence of AI is not an if, right?
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:33.460]   It's happening right in front of our eyes,
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.980]   and the energetic costs associated with that
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:39.740]   are becoming a tangible problem.
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:43.260]   So I think, if you imagine kind of extrapolating that
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:46.740]   into the future, right, what are the,
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:50.340]   what becomes the bottleneck, right?
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:54.380]   The bottleneck might be powering,
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:57.580]   powering the AI, broadly speaking, not one AI,
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:01.100]   but powering that entire AI ecosystem, right?
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:06.100]   So I don't know, I think space junk is kind of,
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:10.380]   it's an interesting idea, but it's heavily influenced
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:13.820]   by like sci-fi of 1950s, where by 2020,
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.140]   we're all like flying to the moon,
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:19.220]   and so we produce a lot of space junk.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:23.300]   I'm not sure if that's the pathway
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.980]   that alien civilizations take.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.940]   I've also never seen an alien civilization,
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.420]   I don't know anything. - That's true.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:34.420]   But if your theory of chill turns out to be true,
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:37.620]   and then we don't necessarily explore,
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:40.260]   we seize the exploration phase of,
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.140]   like alien civilizations quickly seize
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:47.140]   the exploration phase of their efforts,
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.380]   then perhaps they'll just be chilling
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:53.980]   in a particular space, expanding slowly,
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:56.020]   but then using up a lot of resources,
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.020]   and then have to have a lot of garbage disposal
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.500]   that sends stuff out.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.460]   And the other, you know, the other idea
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:04.700]   was that it could be a relay,
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:08.900]   that you'll almost have like these GPS-like markers
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.600]   that you send throughout,
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.020]   which I think is kind of interesting.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.820]   It's similar to this probe idea
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:19.380]   of sending a large number of probes out
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:21.180]   to measure gravitational,
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:27.500]   to measure basically, yeah, the gravitational field,
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.820]   essentially, I mean, a lot of people at Caltech
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:33.060]   or at MIT are trying to measure gravitational fields,
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:37.220]   and there's a lot of ideas of sending stuff out there
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:42.980]   that accurately measures those gravitational fields
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:46.940]   to have a greater understanding of the early universe,
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:49.780]   but then you might realize that communication
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.900]   through gravitation, through gravity,
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:54.420]   is actually much more effective than radio waves,
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:56.140]   for example, something like that.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:59.380]   And then you send out, I mean, okay.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:01.180]   If you're an alien civilization that's able
[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:06.180]   to have gigantic masses, like basically--
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:09.100]   - We're getting there as a civilization.
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.860]   - No, we're not even close.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.940]   - Well, I mean--
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.420]   - No, okay, yeah, okay.
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:17.900]   I mean like be able to sort of play with black holes,
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:18.740]   that kind of thing.
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:21.140]   So we're talking about a whole 'nother order
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.900]   of magnitude of masses.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.540]   Then it may be very effective
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:27.060]   to send signals via gravitational waves.
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:29.500]   - I actually, my sense is that all of these things
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:33.820]   are genuinely difficult to predict.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:36.020]   And I don't mean like to kind of shy away.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:38.060]   I just, I really mean if you think,
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:43.060]   if you take imagination of what the future will look like
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:46.740]   from 500 years ago, right?
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:51.020]   It's just, it is so hard to conceive of the impossible.
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:56.020]   Right, so it's almost like, you know,
[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:58.860]   it's almost limiting to try and imagine things
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:01.660]   that are an order of magnitude, you know,
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.780]   or two orders of magnitude ahead in terms of progress,
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.140]   just because, you know, you mentioned cars before,
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.540]   you know, if you were to ask people what they wanted
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:15.300]   in 1870, it's faster buggies, right?
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:19.620]   So I think the whole like kind of, you know,
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:24.380]   alien conversation inevitably gets limited
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:29.380]   by our entire kind of collective astrophysical
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.740]   lack of imagination, if you know.
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:33.100]   - So to push back a little bit,
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:38.020]   I find that it's really interesting to talk about
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.740]   these wild ideas about the future,
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:41.780]   whether it's aliens, whether it's AI,
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:44.940]   with brilliant people like yourself
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.660]   who are focused on very particular tools of science
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:50.060]   we have today to solve very particular,
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:52.220]   like rigorous scientific questions.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:54.540]   And it's almost like putting on this wild,
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.860]   dreamy hat like some percent of the time
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:00.340]   and say like, what would alien civilizations look like?
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.180]   What would alien trash look like?
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:05.660]   Well, what would our own civilization
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:09.540]   that sends out trillions of AI systems out there,
[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:12.180]   like how 9,000, but 10,000 out there,
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:13.420]   what would that look like?
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:15.500]   And you're right, any one prediction
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.140]   is probably going to be horrendously wrong,
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:19.740]   but there's something about creating
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.780]   these kind of wild predictions
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:24.180]   that kind of opens up--
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.500]   - No, there's a huge magnetism to it, right?
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.140]   And some of it,
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:34.180]   I mean, some of the Jules Verne novels
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:38.100]   did a phenomenal job predicting the future, right?
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:40.180]   That actually was a great example
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.020]   of what you're talking about,
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:44.500]   like allowing your imagination to run free.
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.980]   I mean, I just hope there's dragons.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:51.220]   That's like-- - I love dragons.
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:52.980]   - Yeah, dragons are the best.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:57.300]   - But see, the cool thing about science fiction
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:58.620]   and these kinds of conversations,
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:01.540]   it doesn't just predict the future, I think.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:04.420]   Some of these things will create the future.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:09.460]   Planting the idea, humans are amazing.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:11.060]   Like, fake it till you make it.
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:16.020]   Humans are really good at taking an idea
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:18.140]   that seems impossible at the time,
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:20.940]   and for any one individual human,
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:24.820]   that idea, it's like planting a seed
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:26.340]   that eventually materializes itself.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:27.180]   It's weird.
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:30.700]   It's weird how science fiction can create science fiction.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.540]   - And drive some of the-- - It drives the science.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.540]   - I agree with you.
[02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:36.420]   And I think in this regard,
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:41.340]   I'm like a sucker for sci-fi.
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:46.820]   It's all I listen to now when I run.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.260]   And some of it is completely implausible, right?
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.900]   And it's just like, I don't care.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:56.900]   It's both entertaining
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:01.380]   and it's just like, it's imagination.
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.620]   You know about "The Black Clouds" book?
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:05.500]   I think it was by Fred Hoyle.
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:09.300]   This has great connections with a lot of the advancements
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.660]   that are happening in NLP right now, right?
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:15.900]   With transformer models and so on.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:20.060]   But it's this black cloud shows up in the solar system
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:22.980]   and then people try to send radio
[02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:26.140]   and then it learns to talk back at you.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:28.900]   So anyway, we don't have to talk at all about it,
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:31.100]   but it's just something worth checking out.
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.740]   - With that on the alien front, with the black cloud,
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:36.580]   to me, exactly, on the NLP front,
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:38.740]   and also just explainability of AI,
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:39.820]   it's fascinating.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:41.260]   Just the very question,
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:44.220]   Stephen Wolfram looked at this with the movie "Arrival."
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.260]   It's like, what would be the common language
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.580]   that we would discover?
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:49.420]   The reason that's really interesting to me
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:51.260]   is we have aliens here on Earth now.
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:52.380]   - Japanese.
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.220]   - Japanese, well yeah.
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.780]   - Japanese is the obvious answer.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:57.340]   - Japanese, yeah, that would be the common.
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:59.740]   Maybe it would be music, actually.
[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:00.620]   That's more likely.
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:01.620]   It wouldn't be language.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.860]   It would be art that they would communicate.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:06.340]   But I do believe that we have,
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:09.740]   I'm with Stephen Wolfram on this a little bit,
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:14.060]   that to me, computation, like programs we write,
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:17.820]   they're kind of intelligent creatures
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:20.100]   and I feel like we haven't found the common language
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:21.140]   to talk with them.
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:26.060]   Like our little creations that are artificial
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:28.900]   are not born with whatever that innate thing
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.340]   that produces language with us.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.860]   And like coming up with mechanisms
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.260]   for communicating with them
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:40.900]   is an effort that feels like it will produce
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:42.500]   some incredible discoveries.
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:43.520]   You can even think of,
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:46.220]   if you think that math is discovered,
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:49.300]   mathematics in itself is a kind of--
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.340]   - Oh yeah, it's an innate construction
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:53.060]   of the world we live in.
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:58.340]   I think we are part of the way there
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:03.340]   because pre-1950, right,
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:06.300]   computers were human beings
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.820]   that would carry out arithmetic, right?
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:10.620]   And I think it was Ulam,
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:15.500]   who worked in Los Alamos at the time,
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:19.140]   like towards the end of the Second World War,
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:22.620]   wrote something about how in the future,
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:27.340]   computers will not be just arithmetic tool,
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:31.020]   but will be truly an interactive thing
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:34.300]   with which you could do experiments.
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:36.900]   At the time, the notion of doing an experiment,
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.140]   not like in the lab with some beakers,
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.700]   but an experiment on a computer,
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:45.460]   designing an experiment, a numerical experiment,
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:47.860]   was a new one.
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:52.860]   That's like 70% of what I do is I design,
[02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:57.500]   I write code, terrible code to be clear,
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:01.860]   but I write code that creates an experiment,
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.180]   which is a simulation.
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.820]   So in that sense,
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:08.340]   I think we're beginning to interact with the computer
[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:10.100]   in a way that you're saying,
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:13.260]   not as just a fancy calculator,
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:18.260]   not as just a call and request type of thing,
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:23.100]   but something that can generate insights
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:26.180]   that are otherwise completely unattainable, right?
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:29.620]   They're unattainable by doing analytical mathematics.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.900]   - Yeah, and there's, with the AlphaFold 2,
[02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:36.340]   we're now starting to crack open biology.
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:38.580]   So being able to simulate at first
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:40.100]   trivial biological systems
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:43.140]   and hopefully down the line complex biological systems,
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.980]   my hope is to be able to simulate
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:49.340]   sociological systems like humans.
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:56.220]   A large part of my work at MIT was on autonomous vehicles,
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:00.060]   and the fascinating thing to me was about pedestrians,
[02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:02.580]   human pedestrians interacting with autonomous vehicles,
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:05.580]   and simulating those systems without murdering humans
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:06.700]   would be very useful,
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:08.500]   but nevertheless is exceptionally difficult.
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:09.740]   - Yeah, I would say so.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:11.860]   When is my Mustang gonna drive itself?
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:14.540]   Right, I'm not even joking.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.540]   It looks like, yeah.
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:21.540]   - It turns out it's much more difficult than we imagined.
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.700]   And I suppose that's the kind of,
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:29.620]   the progress of science is just like going to Mars,
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:33.260]   it's probably going to turn out
[02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:35.220]   to be way more difficult than we imagined.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:37.660]   Sending out probes to investigate Planet Nine
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.420]   at the edge of our solar system
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.580]   might turn out to be way more difficult than we imagined,
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:44.340]   but we do it anyway, and we figure it out in the end.
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:45.500]   - It's actually, Mars is a great,
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:48.660]   I mean, sending humans to Mars,
[02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:51.380]   way more complicated than sending humans to the moon.
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:53.900]   You'd think just like naively,
[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:55.860]   both are in space, who cares?
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:58.420]   Like, if you go there, why don't you go there?
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:05.300]   This life support is an extremely expensive thing, yeah.
[02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:06.860]   - There's a bunch of extra challenges,
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:07.980]   but I disagree with you.
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.740]   I would be one of the early people to go.
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:11.340]   I used to think not.
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.740]   I used to think I'd be one of the first,
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.020]   maybe million to go,
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:15.980]   once you have a little bit of a society.
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:19.180]   I think I'm upgrading myself to the first like 10,000.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:21.740]   - That's right, front of the cabin.
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:24.300]   - Not completely front, but like,
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:25.740]   it'd be interesting to die.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:29.740]   I'm okay with, death sucks,
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.100]   but I kind of like the idea of dying on Mars.
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:36.020]   - Of all the places to die,
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.380]   I gotta say in this regard,
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:39.940]   like, I don't wanna die on Mars.
[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:40.780]   - You don't?
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:45.300]   - No, no, I would much rather die on Earth.
[02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:48.220]   I mean, death is fundamentally boring, right?
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:51.020]   Like, death is a very boring experience.
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:52.100]   I mean, I've never died before,
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:54.260]   so I don't know from firsthand experience.
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:55.100]   - As far as you know.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:55.940]   - Yeah.
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.740]   - It could be a reincarnation, all those kinds of things.
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:00.820]   - So you mean, where would you die,
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:02.780]   if you had to choose?
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:08.900]   - Oh man, okay, so I would definitely,
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:11.900]   there's a question of who I'd wanna die with.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:14.620]   I'd prefer not to die alone,
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:20.460]   but like, surrounded by family would be preferable,
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:24.380]   where, I think Northern New Mexico,
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:27.220]   and I'm not even joking, like, this is not a random,
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:28.300]   it's just like--
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:31.180]   - Would that be your favorite place on Earth?
[02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:34.100]   - Not necessarily, like, favorite place on Earth
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:38.380]   to reside at, you know, indefinitely,
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.060]   but it is one of the most beautiful places
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:43.380]   I've ever been to.
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:45.980]   So, you know, there's something,
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:49.900]   I don't know, there's something attractive about going--
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:54.660]   - Returning to nature in a beautiful place.
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:57.460]   Let me ask you about another aspect of your life
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:00.060]   that is full of beauty, music.
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:00.900]   - Okay.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:01.740]   - You're a musician.
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:05.340]   The absurd question I have to ask,
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:07.460]   what is the greatest song of all time?
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:08.300]   - Oh.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.180]   - Objectively speaking.
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:10.900]   - The greatest song of all time.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:14.620]   - I suppose that could change moment to moment, day to day,
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.060]   but if you were forced to answer
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:18.180]   for this particular moment in your life,
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:20.340]   that's something that pops to mind.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.020]   This could be both philosophically,
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.780]   this could be technically as a musician,
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.460]   like what you enjoy, maybe lyrics.
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:28.020]   Like for me, lyrics is very important.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:32.500]   So I would probably, my choice would be lyrics-based.
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:35.420]   - I don't want to answer in terms of just technical,
[02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:37.340]   you know, technical prowess.
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:41.420]   I think technical prowess is impressive, right?
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:44.900]   It's just like, it's impressive what can be done.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.620]   I wouldn't place that into the category
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.980]   of the greatest music ever written.
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:53.660]   Some of the classical music that's written
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:55.300]   is undeniably beautiful,
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:00.300]   but I don't want to consider that category of music either,
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.700]   just because, you know, so if I was to limit
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:08.300]   the scope of this philosophical discussion
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:12.260]   to, you know, the kind of music that I listen to,
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:16.220]   you know, probably "What's My Age Again" by Blink-182.
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:18.460]   It's just, you know, it's a solid one.
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.180]   It's got, you know.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:23.020]   - Said nobody ever.
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:24.020]   - That's a good song.
[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:26.220]   I don't even know if you're joking.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:27.820]   - No, no, I am joking.
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:30.180]   It's a good one, but it's, yeah, I mean.
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:32.180]   - I was gonna go back as a close second.
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:34.420]   (laughing)
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:36.700]   - "What's My Age Again."
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:37.860]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:41.420]   - No, I mean, it would probably, you know,
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:45.140]   songwriting-wise, I think the Beatles came pretty close to-
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:46.540]   - Were they influential to you?
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:47.660]   - Absolutely. - Like the Beatles?
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.140]   - Yeah, love the Beatles.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:50.140]   I love the Beatles.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:54.700]   - "Let It Be," "Yesterday," yeah.
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:57.220]   - I think "Strawberry Fields Forever" is one of,
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:00.060]   you know what one of my favorite Beatles songs is?
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:03.260]   It's, you know, "In My Life," right?
[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.420]   That song, it's hard to imagine how whatever,
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:09.180]   a 24-year-old wrote that.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:14.180]   It is one of the most introspective pieces of music ever.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:17.620]   You know, I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:20.380]   And so I think, you know, if you were to,
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:21.780]   you can sort of look at the entire
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:23.900]   "Dark Side of the Moon" album,
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.820]   and as, you know, getting pretty close up there
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:30.820]   to the pinnacle of what, you know, can be created.
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:33.180]   So, you know, "Time" is a great song.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.780]   - Yeah. - It's a great song.
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:38.260]   - Just the entirety of just the instruments,
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.220]   the lyrics, the feeling created by a song,
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:46.340]   like Pink Floyd can create feelings,
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.820]   just the entire experience.
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:49.220]   I mean, you have that with "The Wall"
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.620]   of just transporting you into another place.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:58.100]   Songs don't, not many songs could do that as well.
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.460]   Not many artists can do that as well as Pink Floyd did.
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:03.540]   - There are a lot of bands that you can kind of say,
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:04.380]   "Oh yeah."
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:07.180]   Like if you take Blink-182, right?
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:10.540]   If you have no idea, like if you are listening
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:14.180]   to sort of that type of pop punk for the first time,
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:16.660]   it's difficult to differentiate between Blink-182
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:20.780]   and like Sum 41 and the thousand of other
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:24.140]   like lesser known bands that all sounded,
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:27.660]   they all had that sparkling production feel.
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.980]   They all kind of sounded the same, right?
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:35.420]   When with Pink Floyd, it's hard to find another band
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:38.500]   that you're like, "Well, is this one Pink Floyd?"
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.780]   Like you know when you're listening to Pink Floyd,
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.300]   what you're listening to.
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:45.380]   - The uniqueness, that's fascinating.
[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:48.940]   You know, in the calculation of the greatest song
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:51.380]   and the greatest band of all time,
[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:54.340]   you could probably actually quantify this
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:58.740]   like scientifically is like how unique,
[02:13:58.740 --> 02:13:59.900]   if you play different songs,
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.700]   how well are people able to recognize
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.420]   whether it's this band or not?
[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:06.300]   And that, you know, that's probably a huge component
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:07.140]   to greatness.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:10.340]   Like if the world would miss it if it was gone.
[02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:12.540]   - Yes, yes.
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:14.740]   - So, but there's also the human story things.
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:19.060]   Like I would say I'll put Johnny Cash's cover of "Hurt"
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:21.980]   as one of the greatest songs of all time.
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.580]   And that has less to do with the song.
[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:26.380]   - But your interaction with it.
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:28.060]   - Interaction with it, but also the human,
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:29.700]   the full story of the human.
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.220]   So like, it's not just, if I just heard the song,
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:33.220]   I'd be like, okay.
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:36.780]   But if it's the full story of it,
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.220]   also the video component for that particular song.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:43.980]   So like that, you can't discount the full experience of it.
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:44.820]   - Absolutely.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:47.740]   You know, I have no confusion about not,
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:52.740]   about being, you know, anywhere, you know, in that lane.
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:56.100]   But I just like, sometimes think about, you know,
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:01.100]   music that is being produced today feels,
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:04.900]   oftentimes feels like kind of clothes,
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:08.700]   like clothes that you buy at like H&M
[02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:12.860]   and you wear three times before they rip and you throw away.
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:16.060]   So like, so much of it is, it's not bad.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:18.540]   It's just kind of forgettable, right?
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:23.460]   Like the fact that we're talking about Pink Floyd in 2021
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:26.380]   is in itself an interesting question.
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:28.140]   Why are we talking about Pink Floyd?
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:30.300]   And it's, there's something unforgettable about them
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:34.260]   and unforgettable about the art that they created.
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:35.940]   - That could be the markets that like,
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:38.300]   so Spotify has created this kind of market
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:43.300]   where the incentives for creating music that lasts
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:46.300]   is much lower because there's so much more music.
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.700]   You just want something that shines bright
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:50.300]   for a short amount of time,
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.820]   makes a lot of money and moves on.
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:54.020]   And I mean, the same thing you see with the news
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:54.860]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:57.660]   We're just living in a shorter and shorter, shorter,
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.380]   like time scale in terms of our attention spans.
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:04.620]   And that, nevertheless,
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:06.620]   when we look at the long arc of history of music,
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:09.220]   perhaps there will be some songs from today
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.540]   that will last as much as Pink Floyd.
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:13.220]   We're just unable to see it.
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.380]   - Yeah, just the collected works of Nickelback.
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.220]   - Exactly.
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:19.940]   You never know, you never know, Justin Bieber.
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:21.620]   It could be a contender.
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:23.220]   I've recently started listening to Justin Bieber
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:25.220]   just to understand what people are talking about.
[02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:27.940]   You know, I'll just keep my comments to myself on that one.
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:29.860]   - It's too good to explain in words.
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:34.860]   - The words cannot capture the greatness that is the Biebs.
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:40.220]   You as a musician, so you write your own music,
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:42.200]   you play guitar, you sing.
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:46.820]   Maybe can you give an overview
[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:48.900]   of the role music has played in your life?
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.540]   You're one of the, you're a world-class scientist.
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.940]   And so it's kind of fascinating to see somebody
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:01.500]   in your position who is also a great musician
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:04.580]   and still loves playing music.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:07.260]   - Yeah, well, I wouldn't call myself a great musician.
[02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:08.780]   - One of the best of all time.
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:12.220]   - That's right.
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:13.300]   - Like we were saying offline,
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.500]   confidence is like the most essential thing
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.340]   about being a rock star.
[02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:17.180]   - Exactly.
[02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:20.460]   It's the confidence and kind of like moodiness, right?
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:26.740]   Yeah, look, I mean, music plays an absolutely essential role
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:31.060]   in everything I do because I lose,
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:34.540]   if I stop playing for one reason or another,
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:38.340]   say I'm traveling, I notably lose creativity
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:41.020]   in every other aspect of my life, right?
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:46.020]   There's something, I don't view playing music
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.380]   as a separate endeavor from doing science
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:50.340]   or doing whatever.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:54.420]   It's all part of that same creative thing,
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:58.020]   which is distinct from, I don't know,
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:02.580]   pressing a button or like, you know.
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:04.460]   - So it's not a break from science,
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:05.860]   it's a part of your science.
[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:08.420]   - It's absolutely, it's a part of,
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:13.420]   I would say, it's a thing that enables the science, right?
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:18.060]   The science would suck even more than it does already
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.220]   without the music.
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:21.060]   - And that means like the creating of the,
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:22.060]   the writing of the music,
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.020]   or is it just even playing other people's stuff?
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:25.380]   Is it a whole of it?
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:27.980]   - Yeah, it's definitely both.
[02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:31.900]   Yeah, and also just, you know,
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:36.620]   I love to play guitar, love to sing, you know,
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:41.620]   my wife tolerates my screeching singing, you know,
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.940]   and even kind of likes it.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:46.700]   - Yeah, so people should check out your stuff.
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.860]   You have a great voice, so I love your stuff.
[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:52.420]   Is there something, you're super busy,
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:56.140]   is there something you could say about practicing
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:00.860]   for musicians, for guitar, for you're also in a band?
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:03.740]   So like that whole, how you can manage that,
[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:05.620]   is there some tricks, is there some hacks
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:10.620]   to being a lifelong musician while being like super busy?
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.900]   - So I would say, you know,
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:18.220]   the way that I optimize my life is I try to,
[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:19.580]   I try to do, you know,
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:22.620]   the thing that I'm passionate about in a moment
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:25.980]   and put that at the top of the priority list.
[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:27.820]   There are moments when, you know,
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:30.340]   you just, you feel inspired to play music.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:31.700]   And if you're in the middle of something,
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:35.180]   if you can avoid, if that can be put on hold, just do it.
[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:37.580]   Right, there are times when you get inspired
[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:41.580]   about something scientific, you know,
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:44.460]   I do my best to drop everything,
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.940]   go into that, you know, mode of,
[02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:51.380]   that isolated mode and execute upon that.
[02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:53.500]   So it's a chaotic, you know,
[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:55.820]   I think I have a pretty chaotic lifestyle
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.020]   where I'm always doing kind of multiple things
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:03.420]   and jumping between what I'm doing.
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:05.220]   But at the end of the day,
[02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:09.220]   it's not like, you know,
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:14.220]   those moments of inspiration are actually kind of rare, right?
[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:16.220]   Like most of the time,
[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:19.900]   all of us are just doing kind of,
[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:22.860]   doing the stuff that needs to get done.
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:26.420]   If you do the disservice to yourself of saying,
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:29.620]   oh, I'm inspired to, you know, do this calculation,
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:33.340]   figure this out, but I've got to answer email
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:37.300]   or just like do something silly, you know,
[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:40.780]   that is nothing more than disservice.
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:44.980]   And also like I have some social media presence,
[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:49.980]   but I mostly stay off of, you know, social media to,
[02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:53.500]   you know, just frankly, 'cause like,
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:57.340]   I don't enjoy the mental cycles that it takes over.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:00.060]   - Yeah, it robs you of that, yeah,
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:03.860]   those precious moments that could be filled
[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:06.780]   with inspiration in your other pursuits.
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:09.620]   But there's something to,
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:10.980]   maybe you and I are different in this.
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:15.300]   Like I try to play at least 10 minutes of guitar every day,
[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:19.140]   like almost on the technical side,
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:24.140]   like keeping that base of basic competence going.
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:29.220]   And I mean, the same way like writers
[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:31.300]   will get in front of a paper, no matter what,
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:32.940]   that kind of thing.
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:36.700]   It just feels like that for my life has been essential
[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:39.580]   to the daily ritual of it.
[02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:43.020]   Otherwise days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:45.180]   and you haven't played guitar for months.
[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:47.380]   - No, no, I understand.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:50.660]   For me, I think it's been like,
[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:53.140]   if we have a gig coming up, we'll definitely--
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:53.980]   - You need deadlines.
[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:54.860]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:59.860]   No, like we will sharpen up definitely,
[02:21:59.860 --> 02:22:02.980]   you know, especially coming up to a gig.
[02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:05.060]   It's like, you know,
[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:06.580]   we're not trying to make money with this.
[02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:11.580]   This is like just for that satisfaction of doing something
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:13.700]   and doing something well, right?
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:19.460]   But overall, I would say most,
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:22.700]   I play guitar most days, most days.
[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:26.300]   And, you know, when I put kids to sleep,
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:28.780]   I play guitar, you know, with them
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:31.980]   and we like just make up random songs about,
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:35.220]   you know, about our cat or something, you know,
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:38.940]   like we just do kind of random stuff.
[02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:41.780]   But, you know, music is always involved in that process.
[02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:43.220]   - Yeah, keeping it fun.
[02:22:43.220 --> 02:22:44.460]   You have Russian roots?
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:45.580]   - I sure do.
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:46.580]   - Were you born in Russia?
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:47.900]   - I was, yeah.
[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:49.220]   - When did you come here?
[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:54.220]   - So I came to the US in the very end of '99,
[02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:59.540]   but so I was like almost 14 years old.
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:03.260]   But along the way, we spent six years in Japan.
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:07.860]   So like we moved from Russia to Japan in '94
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:10.500]   and then to the US in '99.
[02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:12.140]   So then like elementary school,
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:12.980]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:14.100]   - Middle school in Japan.
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:16.180]   - So elementary school in Japan.
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:17.700]   - Yeah.
[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:20.620]   - So that's interesting, do you still speak Russian?
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:21.460]   - Sure.
[02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:22.300]   - Okay.
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:23.820]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:27.700]   Okay, maybe I'll, let me ask you in Russian.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:31.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:33.420]   That'd be interesting to hear you speak in Russian.
[02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:37.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:41.260]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:43.500]   (laughing)
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:47.420]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:49.660]   (laughing)
[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:53.580]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:57.500]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:59.740]   (laughing)
[02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:03.660]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:30.060]   (laughing)
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:31.780]   - So for people who don't speak Russian,
[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:36.020]   Constantine was talking about basically his first
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:39.100]   in 1992 interaction with capitalism,
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:42.700]   which is Pepsi and at first he discovered Pepsi
[02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:44.900]   and then he discovered Coke and he was confused
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:48.780]   how such theft could occur.
[02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.340]   - Like an intellectual property theft.
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:55.020]   And remember, Pepsi arrived to the Soviet Union first
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:58.060]   and there's some complicated story
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:00.900]   which I don't quite understand the details of.
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:05.900]   For a while, Pepsi commanded submarines or something.
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:09.340]   Yeah, Pepsi had like a fleet of Soviet submarines.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:13.780]   - They were sponsoring tanks and this best thing.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:16.460]   And I remember there's certain things that trickled in
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.580]   like McDonald's, I remember that was a big deal.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:19.420]   - Oh yeah, I remember--
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:20.740]   - Certain aspects of the West.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:23.460]   - Absolutely, so I remember we went to McDonald's
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:27.540]   and we stood on, I mean, this is absurd, right,
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:31.900]   from kind of looking at it from today's perspective,
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:34.220]   but we stood in line for like six hours
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:35.900]   to get into this McDonald's.
[02:25:35.900 --> 02:25:40.900]   And I remember inside it was just like a billion people
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:45.340]   and I'm just taking a bite out of that Big Mac.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.860]   We're like, wow.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:49.500]   - Was it an incredible experience for you?
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:52.500]   So like, what does this taste of the West like?
[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:53.340]   Did you enjoy it?
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:56.780]   - I enjoyed the fact that, I mean,
[02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.820]   this is getting into the weeds,
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:02.220]   but I really enjoyed the fact that the top of the bun
[02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:07.220]   had those seeds, and I remember how on the commercials,
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:09.500]   the Big Mac would kind of bounce.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.860]   I was like, the seeds, how do they inject the seeds
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:12.700]   into the bread?
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:15.420]   Amazing, right?
[02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:16.740]   So I think it was--
[02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:18.660]   - Artistry.
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:19.500]   - Yeah, it was just--
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:21.340]   - You enjoy the artistry of the culinary experience.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:26.060]   - Exactly, it was the food art that is the Big Mac.
[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:27.580]   - Actually, I still don't know the answer to that.
[02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:29.100]   How do they get the sesame seeds on the bun?
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:30.420]   - It's better to not know the answer.
[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:31.420]   (laughing)
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:33.500]   - You just wander the mystery of it all.
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:35.380]   Yeah, I remember it being exceptionally delicious,
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:37.180]   but I'm with you.
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:39.860]   I don't know, you didn't mention
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:41.300]   how transformative Pepsi was,
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:44.260]   but to me, basically sugar-based stuff,
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:47.620]   like Pepsi was, or Coke,
[02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:49.180]   I don't remember which one we partook in,
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:50.940]   but that was an incredible experience.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:53.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.
[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:58.220]   And I think it was an important and formative period.
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:08.060]   I sometimes, I guess, rely on that a little bit
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:10.980]   in my daily life, because I remember
[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:15.220]   the early '90s were real rough.
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:20.220]   My parents were kind of on the bottom of the spectrum
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:26.420]   in terms of financial well-being.
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:31.420]   So, kind of like just when I run into trouble,
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:35.180]   not like money trouble,
[02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:37.180]   just any kind of trouble these days,
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.380]   it just kind of is not particularly meaningful
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:44.180]   when you compare it to that turbulent time
[02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:45.420]   of the early '90s.
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:49.420]   And the other thing is, I think there's an advantage
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:54.060]   to being an immigrant, which is that you go
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:58.420]   through the mental exercise of changing your environment
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:00.700]   completely early in your life.
[02:28:00.700 --> 02:28:05.700]   You go, it's by no means pleasant in the moment,
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:09.420]   but going into Japanese elementary school,
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:14.420]   I didn't go to some private thing,
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:17.980]   I just went to a regular Japanese public elementary school,
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:22.780]   and I was the non-Japanese person in my class.
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:26.300]   So, just like the learning Japanese and just kind of--
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:29.300]   - So, that's a super humbling experience in many ways,
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:32.140]   was when you like made fun of all that kind of stuff,
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:33.140]   being the outsider.
[02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:34.340]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:37.980]   But you kind of do that,
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:42.980]   and then you just kind of are okay with stuff,
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.420]   you know what I mean?
[02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:47.940]   And so, like doing that again in middle school in the US,
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:51.260]   it was arguably easy because I was like,
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.100]   yeah, well, I've already done this before.
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:56.700]   So, I think it kind of prepares you mentally a little bit
[02:28:56.700 --> 02:29:00.660]   for switching up for whatever changes that will come up
[02:29:00.660 --> 02:29:02.300]   for the rest of your life.
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:07.300]   So, I wouldn't trade that experience really for anything.
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:11.420]   It's a huge aspect of who I am,
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:14.860]   and I'm sure you can relate to a lot of this.
[02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:17.700]   - Yes, is there advice from your life
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:20.300]   that you can give to young people today,
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:24.260]   high school, college, about their career,
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:26.740]   or maybe about life in general?
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:29.540]   - I'm not like a career coach, but--
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:30.660]   - Life coach.
[02:29:30.660 --> 02:29:32.020]   - I'm definitely not a life coach,
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.620]   I don't have it all figured out.
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:38.620]   But I think there's a perpetual cycle of,
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:42.620]   you know, thinking that there is a,
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:46.340]   there's kind of like a template for success, right?
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:49.540]   Maybe there is, but in my experience,
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:51.140]   I haven't seen it, right?
[02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:57.580]   You know, I would say people in high school, right?
[02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:02.740]   So much of their focus is on getting straight A's,
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:05.060]   filling their CV with this and this and this,
[02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:07.020]   so that it looks interesting.
[02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:08.860]   And they're like, "I'm gonna do this and this
[02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:11.580]   so that it looks impressive," right?
[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:16.580]   That is not, I think, a good way to optimize your life,
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:20.380]   do the thing that fills your life with passion,
[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:24.540]   do the thing that fills your life with interest,
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:28.300]   and do that perpetually, right?
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:33.220]   A straight A student is really impressive,
[02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:36.620]   but also somewhat boring, right?
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:40.500]   So I think, you know, injection of more of that
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:45.260]   kind of interest into the lives of young people
[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:49.060]   would go a long way in just both upping
[02:30:49.060 --> 02:30:50.620]   their level of happiness,
[02:30:50.620 --> 02:30:55.220]   and then just kind of ensuring that looking forward,
[02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:59.660]   they're not suffering from a perpetual condition of,
[02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:01.460]   "Oh, I have to satisfy these like,
[02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:04.940]   you know, check boxes to do well," right?
[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.740]   'Cause you can lose yourself in that whole process
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:07.900]   for the rest of your life.
[02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:09.860]   But it's nice if it's possible,
[02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:13.300]   like Max Tegmark was exceptionally good at this at MIT,
[02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:16.740]   figure out how you can spend a small part of your,
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:18.380]   percent of your efforts,
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:21.620]   such that your CV looks really impressive.
[02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:23.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:26.380]   There's no, like, without a doubt,
[02:31:26.380 --> 02:31:29.340]   like, that's a baseline that you need to have.
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:33.700]   - And then spend, so like, spend most of your time
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:35.940]   doing like amazing things you're passionate about,
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:39.020]   but such that it kind of like Planet Nine
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:42.860]   produces objects that feed your CV,
[02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:45.300]   like slowly over time.
[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:46.700]   So getting good grades in high school,
[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:48.780]   maybe doing extracurricular activities,
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:52.260]   or in terms of like, you know, for programmers
[02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:54.980]   that's producing code that you can show up on GitHub,
[02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:59.980]   like leaving traces like throughout your efforts,
[02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:02.780]   such that your CV looks impressive to the rest of the world.
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:05.860]   In fact, I mean, this is somewhat along the lines
[02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.380]   of what I'm talking about.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:10.460]   See, like getting like good grades is important,
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:14.260]   but grades are not a tangible like product.
[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:17.860]   Like you cannot out, you know, show your A
[02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:21.300]   and have your A live a separate life from you.
[02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:23.900]   Code very much does, right?
[02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:26.900]   Music very much takes on, you know,
[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:29.540]   provided somebody else listens to it, right?
[02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:32.860]   Like takes on a life of its own.
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:34.820]   That's kind of what I mean, right?
[02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:39.820]   Doing stuff that can then get separated from you
[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:45.260]   is exceptionally attractive, right?
[02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:48.540]   It's like a fun and-
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.060]   - And it's also very impressive to others.
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.460]   I think we're moving to a world
[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:53.340]   where grades mean less and less,
[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.780]   like certifications mean less and less.
[02:32:55.780 --> 02:32:58.900]   If you look at, especially again, in the computing fields,
[02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:00.780]   getting a degree, finishing your,
[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:04.580]   currently just finishing your degree,
[02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:07.060]   whether it's bachelor's or master's or PhD
[02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:08.580]   is less important than the things
[02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:10.460]   you've actually put out into the world.
[02:33:10.460 --> 02:33:11.420]   - Right, right.
[02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:13.940]   - And that's a fascinating, that's great that,
[02:33:13.940 --> 02:33:15.620]   in that sense, the meritocracy
[02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:20.900]   in its richest, most beautiful form is starting to win out.
[02:33:20.900 --> 02:33:23.060]   - Yeah, it's weird 'cause like, you know,
[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:25.540]   my understanding, and I'm not like,
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:27.500]   I don't know the history of science well enough
[02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:30.300]   to speak very confidently about this,
[02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:35.300]   but the advisor of my advisor of my advisor from undergrad,
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:39.820]   like didn't have a PhD, right?
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:43.500]   So I think it was a more common thing back in the day,
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:48.500]   even in the academic sector to not have,
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:54.660]   Faraday, like Faraday didn't know algebra,
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:58.540]   he drew diagrams about magnetic fields,
[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:03.540]   and his Faraday's law was derived entirely from intuition.
[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:08.580]   So it is interesting to how the world of academia
[02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:13.180]   has evolved into a, you gotta do this and then get PhD,
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:16.700]   then you have to postdoc once and twice and maybe thrice,
[02:34:16.700 --> 02:34:18.740]   and then like you move on.
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:22.220]   So, you know, it does, I do wonder, you know, if we're,
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:25.620]   if there's a better approach.
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:26.460]   - I think we're heading there,
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:28.900]   but it's a fascinating historical perspective,
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:32.380]   like that we might've just tried this whole thing out
[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:34.340]   for a while where we put a lot more emphasis
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:36.780]   on grades and certificates and degrees
[02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:38.140]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:40.400]   I think the difference historically is,
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.780]   like we can actually, using the internet,
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:48.540]   show off ourselves and our creations
[02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:50.340]   better and better and more effectively,
[02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:52.940]   whether that's code or producing videos
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:53.980]   or all those kinds of things.
[02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:54.820]   - That's right.
[02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:56.720]   You can become a certified drone pilot.
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:03.340]   - Of all the things you wanna pick, yeah, for sure.
[02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:05.140]   Or you could just fly and make YouTube videos
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:07.380]   that gets hundreds of thousands of views with your drone
[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:08.980]   and never getting a certificate.
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:11.720]   That's probably illegal, don't do it.
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:14.420]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:19.300]   So you look at planets, they seem to orbit stuff
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.940]   without asking the why question.
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:25.620]   And for some reason, life emerged on earth
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:27.300]   such that it led to big brains
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:30.180]   that can ask the big why question.
[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:32.020]   Do you think there's an answer to it?
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:36.620]   - I'm not sure what the question is.
[02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:37.980]   Like what do you think? - Meaning of life?
[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:39.080]   - The meaning of life?
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.100]   It's 42.
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:43.060]   - It's 42. - Yeah.
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:47.940]   But aside from that, it's why,
[02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:51.740]   I think the question you're asking is like,
[02:35:51.740 --> 02:35:54.660]   why we do all this, right?
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:56.020]   - Why we do all this?
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:36:00.340]   - It's part of the human condition, right?
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:03.400]   Human beings are fundamentally,
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:08.900]   I feel like sort of stochastic
[02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:13.900]   and fundamentally interested in kind of expanding
[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:17.940]   our own understanding of the world around us.
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:21.540]   - And creating stuff to enable that understanding.
[02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:24.180]   So we're like stochastic, fundamentally stochastic.
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:25.860]   So like there's just a bunch of randomness
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:29.020]   that really doesn't seem like it has a good explanation.
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:32.220]   And yet there's a kind of direction to our being
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:34.500]   that we just keep wanting to create and to understand.
[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:35.320]   - That's right.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:39.800]   I've met people that claim to be anti-science, right?
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:45.300]   And yet in their anti-science discussion,
[02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:50.140]   they're like, "Well, if you're so scientific,
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:53.140]   then why don't you explain to me how, I don't know,
[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:54.140]   this works."
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:56.700]   And like, it always, there's that fundamental--
[02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:57.540]   - There's a curiosity.
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:59.820]   - Seed of curiosity and interest
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:02.460]   that is common to all of us.
[02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:07.180]   That is absolutely what makes us human, right?
[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:11.820]   And I'm in a privileged position of being able
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:16.820]   to have that be my job, right?
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:21.980]   I think as time evolves forward,
[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:25.820]   the kind of economy changes,
[02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:28.140]   I mean, we're already starting to see a shift
[02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:33.140]   towards that type of creative enterprise
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:37.620]   as merging, taking over a bigger and bigger chunk
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:38.980]   of the sector.
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:43.580]   It's not yet, I think, the dominant portion
[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:45.140]   of the economy by any account,
[02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:47.340]   but if we compare this to like,
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:51.860]   the time when the dominant thing you would do
[02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:56.860]   would be to go to a factory and do the same exact thing,
[02:37:56.860 --> 02:38:00.500]   right, I think there's a tide there
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:02.540]   and things are sort of headed in that direction.
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:04.460]   - Yeah, life's becoming more and more fun.
[02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:06.980]   I can't wait, honestly, what happens next.
[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:08.180]   - I can't wait to just chill.
[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:09.020]   - Just chill.
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:11.860]   - The terminal point of this is just chill
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:13.380]   and wait for those Kuiper belt objects
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:14.660]   to complete one orbit.
[02:38:14.660 --> 02:38:17.300]   - I'm gonna credit you with this idea.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:22.180]   I do hope that we definitively discover proof
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:25.020]   that there is a planet nine out there in the next few years
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:27.340]   so you can sit back with a cigar, a cigarette,
[02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:31.900]   or vodka, or wine, and just say, I told you so.
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.140]   - That's already happening.
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:33.980]   (laughing)
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:35.340]   I'm gonna do that later tonight.
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:36.460]   (laughing)
[02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:38.860]   - As I mentioned, confidence is essential
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:40.460]   to being a rock star.
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:43.260]   I really appreciate you explaining
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:45.020]   so many fascinating things to me today.
[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.780]   I really appreciate the work that you do out there
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:50.820]   and I really appreciate you talking with me today.
[02:38:50.820 --> 02:38:52.020]   - Alex, it was a pleasure. - Thanks, Constantin.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.980]   - Thanks for having me on.
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:55.500]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:59.140]   with Constantin Batygin and thank you to Squarespace,
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:02.540]   Litterati, Onnit, and Ni.
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:06.140]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:07.780]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:10.180]   from Douglas Adams in "The Hitchhiker's Guide
[02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:11.140]   to the Galaxy."
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:14.820]   Far out in the uncharted backwaters
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:18.460]   of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm
[02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:23.460]   of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.
[02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:28.220]   Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles
[02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:31.940]   is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet
[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:34.300]   whose ape-descendant life forms
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:36.420]   are so amazingly primitive
[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:38.860]   that they still think digital watches
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:40.820]   are a pretty neat idea.
[02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:42.820]   Thank you for listening.
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:44.660]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:47.240]   (upbeat music)
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:49.820]   (upbeat music)
