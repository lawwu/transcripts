[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Oh, you can see everyone.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   One more time.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Give it up for Taylor Laramore.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Hey.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   All right.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Taylor, it's a real honor and pleasure to have you with us tonight.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And we have a little surprise for you, okay?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So I'm going to bring up to the stage now Andrew Bogle.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Andrew, as you know, is Jack's son.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And Andrew has some words for you.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So here you go, Andrew.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> How are you doing, Taylor?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Good, good, good.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So Taylor, it is my honor and privilege to welcome you to the Bogleheads Hall of Fame.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   While Taylor has been, as you've heard, one of the founders of the Vanguard Diehards
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and then the Bogleheads, what impresses me most is that Taylor is a lifelong teacher
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and lives a life embodying my dad's deeply held belief to serve honest-to-God, down-to-earth
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   human beings who have their own hopes, fears, and financial goals.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Taylor has likely assisted hundreds of thousands of people and two generations through his
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   advice, guidance, online posts, and books.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You could argue that Taylor was essentially a founding crew member in Vanguard's personal
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   advisor services, and he did it in a way that always respected the human values of the investors
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and prospective investors, and he did it for no fee.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   As my dad has quoted Helen Keller so wisely, he wrote, "The world has moved along not only
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   honest worker."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   As my dad said in his speech, "The main thing that I've tried to do was to create a working
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   environment based on integrity, service, and ethical values, a place where each of us,"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   after Lincoln said, "are touched by the better angels of our nature."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That was his inaugural address in 1861.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And as you have heard, Taylor has been deemed the king of the bogleheads, and I would like
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to add one other title for Taylor, and that is the angel of investors.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Thank you, Taylor.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   [Applause]
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I'm so thrilled to meet one of Jack's sons.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I'm blessed with a wonderful son.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   He'll be guiding me tonight.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   But your dad just changed my life.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'll give you one example.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   One time I was having dinner at his house.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Your mother was in the kitchen.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Jack and I were in the patio just outside.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And I used a profanity.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Well, you already know the answer.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Your dad said, "Please, please.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   My wife might be listening."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I've never used a profanity, I ever have.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Well, Taylor, welcome as the first person in the new Bogleheads Hall of Fame.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Congratulations, you are just like the boglehead number one.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You are now the first introductee into the Bogleheads Hall of Fame.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   [Applause]
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Are we all going to make mistakes?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I don't think so.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Not this time.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well deserved.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   We're going to turn you around so you can see everyone as we give you a big round of
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   applause and a standing ovation.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   [Applause]
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   All right.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Okay, Taylor, it's been great seeing you.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We'll see you again next year.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I hope so.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   We'll see you next year.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You're going to live to 100.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   That's the last thing you said to me a couple of weeks ago was you're going to live to 100.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Well, I remember.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I remember on my -- I think it was my birthday, you flew into Miami to wish me well.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And it did work.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I'm not coming back to 100, so you've got to live to 100.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   [Laughter]
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Okay, we're going to sign off now.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Great seeing you.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You look great.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And best to you and your family.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   So take care, Taylor.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Bye-bye.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   [Applause]
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   [Applause]
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   [Applause]
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   [Applause]
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   [Applause]
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   [Applause]
