[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.500]   Well, should we raise our hands during musical worship or should we keep them safely in our pockets?
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's the question from a listener named Jeff.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500]   Pastor John, when you are singing at your local church, do you raise your hands?
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   Is this something we should do when singing at church on Sunday?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   When I read verses like 1 Chronicles 16, verses 23 to 31, and Psalm 95, verses 1 and 2,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500]   it makes me wonder why not everyone lifts their hands when we sing together as a church.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.000]   If only 5% of the congregation in my local church is raising their hands during the worship time,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.500]   but all are singing out loudly with a joyful noise, is this something we should teach on
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.000]   in order to encourage the raising up of holy hands, or should I just be thankful that we're all singing together?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   As the worship leader at my local church, I want to be maximalist in my thinking
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.500]   and always find ways to encourage myself and our congregation to be more fully devoted and fully delighted in Jesus
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.500]   as we sing songs which are soaked in rich gospel lyrics.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jeff?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I can remember in the late 70s when I was a college teacher, a specific chapel service
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in which I was sitting beside a fellow faculty member who, during a prayer, simply laid his hands, palms up, on his lap,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and the almost disgust that I felt seeing him do that.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And I don't remember what was going on in my soul at that time,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   but what I feel now is nothing but shame and remorse at such an arrogant and judgmental attitude.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And then about five years later, I had encouraged Bethlehem, so I moved from faculties to pastoring,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and about two years into my pastoring, this happened.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I had encouraged Bethlehem to start up all-night prayer meeting once or twice a year
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.500]   in order to go hard after God together to maximize His blessing in the life of our church.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   And it was about 2 a.m., and there were about 20 or 30 of us still praying in the fireside room,
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   which doesn't exist anymore. It was torn down in one of the building projects.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.000]   And I remember that Bruce Liefblad, who was worship leader at the time, was leading us
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.500]   in a simple 1980s song like, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah," just simple things like that.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   And we were singing one of those. I don't remember which one.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   And suddenly, I found my hands lifted in the air, and it was as though I was watching myself rather than doing it.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   I had never in 36 years of my life lifted my hands in song until that moment.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   And to this day, I cannot explain what happened, except that it bore fruit in what felt and feels to me now
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   like a release from a very significant bondage.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   My approach toward lifting up of hands in worship since that time has been to simply try to create an atmosphere
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   in which people feel free from the heart to lift their hands or not.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   And the reason I say or not is because coerced or constrained demonstrations of heart worship are self-contradictory.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Either it comes from the heart and is valuable as an expression of the heart, or it is a performance and has no worship value at all.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   I wouldn't, as a worship leader, ever say, "Come on, people, get your hands up. We just sang a song. Our hands are lifted up."
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   I wouldn't scold people like that at all.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   It creates an unbelievably hypocritical crisis for them because they're going to do what you say when they don't feel like it,
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   and it will ruin authentic worship.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   Depending on the kind of service and who was present and what the nature of the music was,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   I would guess that over time at Bethlehem, in any given service, you might have 10 to 30 percent of the people lifting their hands in worship.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   And we never tried to cultivate an atmosphere where it was expected that you're supposed to do this if you're spiritual.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   Although Psalm 63, 4 says, "I will bless you as long as I live in your name. I will lift up my hands."
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   And Psalm 141, verse 2 says, "Let my prayer be counted as incense before you and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice."
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   And Paul says in 1 Timothy 2, 8, "I desire then that in every place men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling."
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   Now, I doubt that Paul meant in that 1 Timothy 2, 8 passage that it's contrary to God's will for men to pray without lifting their hands.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   Rather, I think probably what he means is it's contrary to God's will that they pray without holy hands being lifted if they lift their hands.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   In other words, I don't think it's a mandate that every time a man prays, his hands must be in the air,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   that if his hands are in the air in his prayer, they better be holy hands.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   And let me mention one other cultural factor and a closing word of personal things.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   I was talking to a church leader outside America once who tried to explain to me that lifting the hands in worship in his city was a badge of bad theology.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   It was associated with certain churches that taught wrong things and that he felt it would be a compromise in faithful churches if the people raised their hands.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   They'd be waving the flag of false teaching.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   That's the kind of thing you really need to be sensitive to when you're an outsider and you walk into a cultural situation you don't know anything about.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   However, I suggested to him that there's probably a better way to distinguish ourselves from false teaching than by letting the false teachers co-opt a beautiful biblical practice as their own while the true church goes without it.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   Perhaps one word to those who are finding the lifting of hands in worship to be artificial for themselves rather than real.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   Let's just all agree that whether we are very formal or more charismatic, we are all equally vulnerable to hypocrisy and artificiality and judgmentalism.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   Hymns can be sung with just as much inauthenticity as worship songs.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Organs can be played with just as much hypocrisy as guitars.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Hands can be kept down for motives just as defective as they can be lifted up.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   As a hand raiser, I would just say to those who don't do it, for me, it is both a natural expression of inner admiration for God and an intensifier of inner exaltation as it finds expression in the body.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   And I hope that those who don't find it to be so have their own experiences of released admiration and inner exaltation and intensification.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500]   And I believe that is possible.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   And I will assume that is the case when I am worshiping with you, if you're one of those.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   Really good thoughts, Pastor John.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   Thank you.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   And carefully put here, because if the Bible says that we should do it every time, right?
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   What about holy kisses as a practice, well described in the New Testament and mostly neglected by American churches?
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   That was in episode 742, the holy kiss, relevant today or not?
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   Episode 742, check it out.

[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   Was holiness the fight against sin or is holiness the fight for joy in God?
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   It's another great question from a perceptive listener.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   That's next time on Wednesday when we return.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
