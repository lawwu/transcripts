[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.940]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.500]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.940]   Today, we are discussing ketamine.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.280]   Ketamine is a fascinating compound,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.480]   and it's one that nowadays is being used both clinically
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   for the treatment of depression and suicidality and PTSD,
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.800]   and it is also a drug that is commonly abused.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.020]   That is, ketamine is often used recreationally,
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.480]   and it has a high potential for abuse.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   So today, we are going to discuss both the research
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900]   on the clinical benefits of ketamine,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.060]   as well as the risks of ketamine.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.760]   We are going to discuss the mechanisms of action
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.340]   by which ketamine produces
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.560]   what are called dissociative states.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.280]   I will define for you what a so-called K-hole is
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.760]   in scientific terms.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.620]   I will talk about dosages of ketamine.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.980]   I'll talk about delivery routes of ketamine,
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.780]   and throughout, I will be emphasizing
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.220]   both the clinical benefits and the risks,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.860]   that is, the potential harms of using ketamine
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.080]   out of the appropriate clinical context.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.520]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.340]   you will understand thoroughly what ketamine is,
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.060]   how it works in the brain and body
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.680]   to produce dissociative states and to relieve depression,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.060]   and you will understand
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.700]   how it can actually change neural circuitry.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.260]   This is an important thing to understand about ketamine.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.620]   The acute or immediate effects of ketamine,
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.440]   while one is under the influence of ketamine,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.940]   are just part of the story of how ketamine modifies the brain
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.620]   for the treatment of depression, suicidality, and PTSD.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.460]   And by extension, when people use ketamine recreationally,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.100]   there are those immediate acute effects of ketamine,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.660]   but there are also long-term changes in the brain
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.460]   that are important to understand.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.420]   During today's discussion,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.500]   we will also be talking a lot about neuroplasticity,
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.560]   or your nervous system's ability to change
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.100]   in response to experience.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.060]   And we will be talking about neuroplasticity,
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.200]   not just in the context of ketamine,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.220]   but as a general theme for how your nervous system changes
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.340]   anytime you learn anything.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.680]   And in that discussion, you're going to hear a lot
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.900]   about BDNF, or brain-derived neutrophic factor.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.220]   Brain-derived neutrophic factor is a critical molecule
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.140]   for all forms of learning and memory
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.060]   and changes to your nervous system.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.820]   So in addition to learning about ketamine
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.960]   and how it works clinically
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.740]   and its relevance to recreational use and abuse,
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.400]   you will also learn a lot about neuroplasticity and BDNF
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.720]   and what it's doing in your brain right now as you learn.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.460]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.380]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.340]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.420]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.840]   to the general public.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.060]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.980]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.040]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.140]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.020]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.140]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.820]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.000]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.740]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.960]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.880]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.940]   with an enormous number of different challenges
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.020]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.180]   when, for instance, you go from a shady area to a sunny area
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180]   when you look at something up close or off in the distance.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.740]   Roca understands all of that
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.180]   and have designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.620]   so that regardless of conditions,
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.020]   you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.500]   Their glasses are also extremely lightweight,
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.960]   and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.500]   In fact, initially, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.040]   were designed for use in sports,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.660]   things like running and cycling, et cetera,
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.140]   and they still can be used for that,
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.840]   but really, their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280]   are designed to be worn anytime.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   I wear readers at night or when I drive at night,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.080]   and I'll sometimes wear sunglasses in the middle of the day,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.400]   although, of course, I do not wear sunglasses
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.580]   when I do my morning sunlight exposure,
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.500]   which everyone should be doing
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.260]   to set their circadian rhythm.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.920]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.980]   simply go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A, dot com,

[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.660]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.240]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.300]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.440]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   and elsewhere about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.620]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.520]   When we're sleeping well and enough,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.940]   all of those things are improved,
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.100]   and when we are not sleeping well or enough,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.940]   all of those things, mental health, physical health,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.040]   and performance all get worse.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.460]   Now, a key component to getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.900]   is that the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.540]   has to be such that your body temperature drops
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.700]   by one to three degrees in order to fall
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.380]   and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380]   and that your body temperature increase
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.600]   by about one to three degrees in order to wake up
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.880]   feeling refreshed.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.420]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.700]   you can customize the temperature
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.860]   of your sleeping environment
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.840]   such that you always get the best possible night's sleep.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.540]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.880]   for about two years now,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.660]   and I must say it has vastly improved my sleep.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.920]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.440]   you can go to EightSleep.com/Huberman
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.500]   and save $150 off off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.720]   They currently ship in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.220]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.100]   Again, that's EightSleep.com/Huberman.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.940]   Okay, let's talk about ketamine.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.340]   I realize that many people have heard of ketamine,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.980]   but most people don't realize
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.660]   that ketamine is very similar to another drug
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.120]   called PCP or fencyclidine,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.840]   which goes by the street names angel dust or sherm.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.940]   It has some other street names as well.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.340]   When I was growing up, I heard a lot about PCP.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.020]   They taught us about it in school.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.380]   You'd hear about it on cop shows, on television,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.300]   and the lore was that PCP
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.700]   would eliminate people's perception of pain
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.020]   and would make them violent.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.120]   You'd hear these stories in drug education classes
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.660]   that when people are on PCP,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.980]   they're punching light poles and breaking their hands.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.420]   They can fight off eight or 10 police officers
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.140]   who are trying to handcuff them.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.740]   I don't know whether or not any of that is true or not,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.200]   but we heard a lot about PCP
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.340]   and it was associated with drugs of abuse,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.020]   things like cocaine, methamphetamine.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.940]   It was lumped into that category.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.740]   Nowadays, when we hear about ketamine,
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.620]   rarely do people mention that ketamine and PCP
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.340]   actually have the same mode of action, more or less.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.680]   Okay, I'm not talking about the specifics.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.820]   I'm talking broadly.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.180]   They have the same mode of action in the brain.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.100]   The both of them are dissociative anesthetics.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.620]   And nowadays, usually when we hear about ketamine,
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.140]   we are hearing about its benefits.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.920]   We are hearing that it can help cure depression.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.240]   We are hearing that it can help reduce or cure suicidality,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.860]   that it can be used to treat PTSD.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.860]   And indeed, all of that is true
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.460]   in the appropriate clinical context,
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.620]   at the appropriate dosages,
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.580]   and given at the appropriate frequency,
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.920]   ketamine has proven to be a miraculous drug
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.600]   for some people, not all people,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.820]   for the treatment of depression, suicidality, and PTSD.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.940]   That said, ketamine also has a very high potential for abuse.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.240]   And so it may come as no surprise
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.540]   that we often hear about ketamine nowadays,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.580]   also in the context of its use at parties.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.860]   You hear about people going into so-called K holes,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.040]   which is a particular state
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.020]   associated with overdoing the dosage of ketamine
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.780]   a little or a lot.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.180]   We'll get back to that a little bit later,
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.380]   what it is, how dangerous it is, et cetera.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.320]   In any case, ketamine is an incredible drug,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.640]   very similar to PCP, fencyclidine.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.400]   And it is a drug that nowadays there is crossover
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.480]   between the clinical uses of ketamine
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.160]   for treatment of depression, et cetera,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   and its recreational use.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.300]   What I'm referring to is people accessing ketamine legally
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.740]   for the purpose of treating depression,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.960]   but taking that ketamine out of the clinic,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.400]   out of the doctor's office,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.520]   which is a very different set of conditions
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.900]   than most of the studies that have been done on ketamine
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.440]   and its role in depression.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.760]   And not surprisingly,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.880]   if there's increased access to a drug like ketamine,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.080]   really any drug that has a potential for abuse,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.920]   then we also see an increase in the number of people
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.240]   that are using that drug recreationally,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.540]   and some of them do indeed get addicted to ketamine.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.020]   So I know many of you are probably wondering,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.560]   can you get addicted to ketamine?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.160]   Indeed, people can get addicted to ketamine.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.860]   There are some people who like its effects enough
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.200]   that they find themselves compelled to use ketamine
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.320]   even though the use of ketamine
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.720]   is degrading their overall life performance.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.680]   So work, school, relationships, finances, et cetera.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.000]   That said, ketamine does have
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.760]   these established clinical uses.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.640]   So nowadays the landscape around ketamine
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.380]   is oh so different than it was 10 or 20 years ago,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.520]   when it was lumped very closely with PCP, fencyclidine,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.400]   and really just looked at as a drug of abuse.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.800]   There were some early cases in the 1970s
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.040]   of the use of ketamine in order to treat PTSD.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   This was mainly in soldiers in Vietnam
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.260]   or people coming back from Vietnam.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.940]   But really the clinical use of ketamine
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.620]   for the treatment of depression, suicidality, and PTSD
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.600]   has really just taken off in the last five to 10 years.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.120]   And that's what's brought us to this new landscape
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.720]   of interest and understanding and use of ketamine
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.040]   in the clinical and recreational context.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.780]   So how is it that a drug that at one time
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.160]   was really just viewed as a street drug
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.860]   that was bad, bad, bad is now being prescribed widely
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.200]   and has all this interest surrounding it?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.480]   And really this has to do with our understanding
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   of what depression is and what depression isn't.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.400]   So I'd like to just take one or two minutes
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.760]   and explain to you a little bit
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.400]   about the history of depression and its treatment.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.080]   What we observed starting about the middle
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.640]   of the last century, so around 1950,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.360]   but really taking off in the early 1980s and 90s
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.960]   is the so-called monoamine hypothesis of depression.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.900]   Monoamines, as the name suggests,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.440]   are synthesized from amino acids.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.040]   That's a good way to remember monoamines.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.120]   Monoamines include things like serotonin,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.160]   dopamine, and norepinephrine,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.360]   although there are other monoamines as well.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.680]   Monoamines are neurotransmitters, or more specifically,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.080]   they are neuromodulators, meaning they change the activity
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.400]   of neural circuits in the brain and body.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.280]   They can ramp up levels of activity
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.920]   in lots of different brain areas,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.760]   or they can reduce the activity of neural circuits
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.560]   in lots of different brain areas,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.320]   as well as within the body, right?
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.180]   Your gut has serotonin and needs serotonin.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.800]   Dopamine also plays important roles in the body,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.880]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.920]   The monoamine hypothesis of depression
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.400]   is really centered around the idea
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.300]   that it is deficiencies in these monoamines,
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.320]   either serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine,
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.840]   or some combination of those that gives rise to depression.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.360]   Now, in reality, there is very little, if any, evidence
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.300]   that there is a deficiency of monoamines
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.320]   in any form of depression.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.920]   However, it is very clear that drugs
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.240]   that increase certain monoamines,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.720]   so drugs like Prozac or Zoloft that increase serotonin,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.120]   or drugs like bupren, which is often called Welbutrin,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.700]   which is its commercial name,
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.200]   which increases dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.080]   can often provide relief
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.640]   for certain symptoms of depression in some people.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.700]   However, what we've learned over the last 30 or 40 years
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.160]   is that drugs that are designed
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.880]   to increase certain monoamines
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.360]   in order to treat depression only work
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.560]   in about 40% of depressed people that take them,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.720]   and they have a lot of side effects.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.120]   Now, some people are lucky enough
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.540]   that they can use a low enough dose,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.100]   or perhaps even a high enough dose
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.780]   that gives them relief from their depressive symptoms,
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.200]   but does not give them side effects
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.880]   that make it so uncomfortable for them to use that drug
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.560]   that they would choose rather to not take that drug.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.680]   However, a lot of people that do get depression relief
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.600]   from things like Zoloft or Paxil or from bupren,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.140]   find that the side effects,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.460]   which include things like dry mouth,
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.100]   although more commonly reductions or increases in appetite,
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.420]   or vast reductions in libido,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.180]   or changes in their sleep patterns, et cetera,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.380]   that those side effects really make it impossible,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.600]   or at least very uncomfortable for them to take those drugs.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.400]   And of course, there are the 60% of depressed people
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.240]   who do not respond to those drugs at all.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.420]   Now, I want to be very clear.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.840]   Things like SSRIs, things like Wellbutrin
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.700]   have helped a tremendous number of people
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.560]   get relief from depressive symptoms,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.800]   and in many cases have warded off suicidality as well.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.840]   However, there are also a great number of people
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.520]   who have experienced a lot of side effects
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.220]   and problems from these drugs,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.460]   hence the desire to find other compounds
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.740]   that can treat depression
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.160]   without creating similar side effect profiles,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.680]   and that ideally can provide relief not just for 40%,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.360]   but for all people suffering from depression.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.240]   So that's where ketamine enters the picture.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.340]   Prior to the 1990s, they were mainly studied in neuroscience
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.400]   and pharmacology laboratories for their abuse properties
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.720]   and for their anesthetic properties.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.920]   So ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's actually used to induce
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.020]   certain forms of anesthesia for surgery.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.400]   It's not always used, but it's often used.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.860]   This is something that if you've ever had a surgery,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.680]   you might want to ask your anesthesiologist about,
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.080]   what sorts of drugs are you giving me to go under?
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.440]   What sorts of drugs are you keeping me to stay under?
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.400]   And maybe even what sorts of drugs are you giving me
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.680]   to bring me out of anesthesia?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.900]   'Cause it turns out that when you go into anesthesia,
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.480]   your anesthesiologist is rarely giving you just one drug.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.780]   Typically, they're giving you one drug
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.300]   to kill off a little bit of anxiety
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.360]   and maybe eliminate a little bit of pain sometimes.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.600]   And then they'll give you another drug
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.960]   to drop you into a deeper plane of anesthesia.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.780]   And then nowadays, there are sophisticated ways
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.760]   to monitor your plane of anesthesia,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.540]   and there are sophisticated ways to, if necessary,
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.360]   get you out of a deep plane of anesthesia
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.340]   if that plane of anesthesia is too deep.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.860]   When I talk about a plane of anesthesia,
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.440]   I'm just talking about going from full wakefulness
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.360]   to a reduction in anxiety, to falling asleep, to asleep,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.260]   to the point where even if someone were to pinch your toe
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.800]   or your arm, like a really intense pinch,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.420]   that you wouldn't wake up from that.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.280]   Okay, so ketamine has the property of being an anesthetic.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.500]   It kills the response to pain, and at certain doses,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.960]   it can bring you into deep planes of anesthesia.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.480]   At lesser dosages, it can take you into transition points
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.000]   between awake and deeply anesthetized.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.480]   And it's really that transition point
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.700]   between awake and deeply anesthetized,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.060]   which we are going to call the dissociative state.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.480]   It's kind of this liminal state, a little bit like dreaming.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.920]   It can have some dream-like qualities to it.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.040]   That's the state that has most often been sought after
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.120]   or employed for the treatment of depression,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.060]   suicidality, and PTSD,
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.560]   which brings up a really important point,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.320]   which is that when people use ketamine recreationally,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.440]   it's not clear exactly what plane of anesthesia
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.740]   or dissociation they are actually seeking.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.400]   And this is why we hear about some of the desired effects
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.200]   of ketamine that are driving people to use it recreationally
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.000]   and why we also hear about people having some unpleasant
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.800]   or even very unpleasant or dangerous experiences
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.140]   when using ketamine recreationally.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.520]   Because we're talking about a drug
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.300]   that has a lot of different effects,
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.520]   depending on the dosages, and as we'll soon talk about,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   individuals vary tremendously in their response
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.080]   to different dosages of ketamine
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.300]   and the delivery route for ketamine,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.360]   whether or not it's delivered orally in the form of a pill
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.300]   or put sublingually in what's called a troche
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.960]   that dissolves under the tongue or it's injected.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.380]   Whether or not it's injected into the vein
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.160]   or intramuscularly, et cetera.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.960]   Each of those can produce very different effects
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.280]   in terms of the speed of onset of the drug
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.980]   and the type of effects that it produces
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.200]   in the brain and body.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.120]   So what happened in the early '90s
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.880]   is that laboratories that were studying animal models,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.560]   what we call preclinical models of things like depression
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.200]   and learning and memory, and to some extent ketamine,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.340]   but mainly focusing on learning and memory and depression,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.060]   made an interesting discovery.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.100]   There's a certain preclinical model of depression
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.140]   that's pretty common in laboratories
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.340]   that involves taking a rat or a mouse
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.060]   and putting it into a small container,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.980]   like it looks like a beaker or a jar,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.220]   sometimes it's a tray and it has water in it.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.680]   And you might be surprised to learn, perhaps not,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.100]   that if you put a rat or a mouse into water, it will swim.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.220]   Okay, so it's treading water
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.060]   in order to keep its head above water and not drown.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.540]   I realize for some of you,
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.380]   this might be a bit of an aversive topic
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.600]   to hear about animal research,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.200]   but this is one of the common preclinical models
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.060]   of depression, which is put a rat or a mouse into water,
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.160]   let it swim and see at what point it gives up.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.000]   Because what happens is if you put a rat or mouse into water,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.840]   it will attempt to save its own life by swimming,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.140]   but at some point it will just give up
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.280]   and it will just start sinking.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.700]   And then of course, the researcher needs to rescue
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.580]   the rat or mouse, put it back into its home cage,
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.020]   dry it off, give it some food, et cetera.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.600]   This preclinical model is called
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.580]   the model of learned helplessness,
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.680]   and it's become a prominent preclinical model of depression,
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.140]   because of course we can't ask mice or rats
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.900]   if they are depressed or happy.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.660]   I suppose you can ask them,
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.800]   but they're not going to answer
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.300]   in any kind of meaningful way.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.260]   So we can only look at their behavior
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.980]   in order to understand whether or not
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.920]   they have a sense of happiness or a sense of depression.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.780]   And of course, that's very hard to gauge
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.920]   in an animal model of any kind.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.020]   You could make guesses based on other behaviors,
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.340]   like are they grooming regularly?
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.780]   Are they eating regularly?
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.580]   Things that more or less parallel
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.480]   what we think of as health or lack of health
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.400]   in a human who's happy or depressed.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.360]   But in the context of trying to understand depression
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.140]   in these preclinical animal models,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.460]   having a behavior that you can really quantify carefully
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.960]   across a lot of different animals and conditions
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.040]   is really beneficial.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.420]   So this thing of putting a rat or mouse into water
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.580]   and seeing how long it takes
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.140]   before they give up to save their own life
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.800]   is called the model of learned helplessness.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.420]   And what it allowed researchers to do
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.700]   was to take rats and mice, put them into water,
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.620]   see how long it took before they gave up,
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.660]   and then to give them different drugs
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.720]   to see whether or not any of those drugs
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.600]   either hastened, sped up, or prolonged
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.440]   the duration over which the animal would attempt
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.740]   to save its own life.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.900]   This actually has some meaningful parallels
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.100]   to human depression.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.140]   You know, one of the hallmarks of depression
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.820]   is that people stop thinking positively about their future.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.440]   Depression, of course, can include a lot of other symptoms.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.520]   You know, one of the most prominent symptoms of depression,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.140]   for instance, is consistently waking up
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.480]   around 2.30 or 3.30 in the morning
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.380]   and not being able to fall back asleep again.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.280]   Now, keep in mind, it is not the case
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.060]   that if you're waking up at 2.30 or 3.30 in the morning
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.280]   and you can't fall back asleep,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.300]   that you are absolutely depressed.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.400]   That's simply not the case.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.980]   But that pattern of lack of sleep
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.620]   plus some other things like lack of anticipation
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.180]   of a positive future, inability to imagine the future
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.860]   in any kind of meaningful or positive way, et cetera,
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.140]   are part of the key features
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.700]   of what we call a major depressive episode.
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.140]   So this preclinical model of learned helplessness
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.660]   allowed researchers to test a lot of different drugs
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.220]   and establish which drugs at which dosages
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.020]   allowed animals to fight for their life longer
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.160]   when placed into water.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.520]   It's really that simple as a model,
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.060]   but it revealed some very interesting things,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.060]   at least one of which is that
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.260]   when animals were injected with ketamine,
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.040]   this dissociative anesthetic,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.160]   but they were injected with dosages of ketamine
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.460]   that were below what would induce full anesthesia,
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.860]   these animals would swim for their life for a lot longer.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.980]   Now, to some extent, that ought to be surprising,
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.820]   and in fact was surprising to researchers
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.820]   because ketamine is what's called an NMDA receptor blocker.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.420]   Now, when I say blocker, I'm not getting into the details
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.700]   of what specific form of blocker it is,
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.140]   but I do want to mention that a blocker
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.820]   is sometimes referred to as an antagonist,
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.260]   whereas something that promotes the activity of a receptor
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.940]   is called an agonist, okay?
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.660]   So if you can just remember
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.500]   that ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist or blocker,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.340]   then you should be fine
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.360]   for the rest of today's conversation.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.940]   Now, I haven't told you what NMDA is.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.780]   NMDA stands for N-methyl-D-aspartate,
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.600]   and you do not need to remember that,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.860]   but the surprise for researchers was that this drug, ketamine,
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.420]   is allowing animals to fight for their life for longer,
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.180]   so it has this sort of property
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.700]   of overcoming what we call learned helplessness
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.460]   or a sense of helplessness, AKA antidepressant effects,
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.480]   and we also know
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.100]   that it's an NMDA receptor antagonist or blocker,
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.500]   and that's perplexing because we also know
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.460]   that the NMDA receptor is critical
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.900]   for changing neural circuitry in the brain.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.060]   It's critical for neuroplasticity.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.660]   So put differently, here's a drug that blocks the receptor
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.460]   that's critical for neuroplasticity for changes in the brain,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.220]   and yet somehow it's allowing these animals
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.280]   to fight for their life longer.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.500]   It's somehow giving them more of a sense of hope.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.220]   At least that's the subjective interpretation
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.480]   of what one observes when a mouse or rat
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.780]   is swimming for much longer
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.340]   when it would otherwise just give up
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.300]   and sink to the bottom of the vessel.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.480]   Now, in general, there are two kinds of scientists.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.080]   There are scientists that take a look at a set of findings
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.740]   like that and say, oh, here's a drug
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.120]   that's supposed to be terrible for us.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.320]   It's an anesthetic, and it blocks NMDA receptors,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.640]   and NMDA receptors are good for neuroplasticity,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.880]   and somehow it's also allowing these animals to swim longer,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.300]   and I would say one category of scientists
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.480]   would just look at that and just say,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   wow, that is a big ball or tangle of confused facts.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.520]   How does one even reconcile that, right?
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.000]   Brain change ought to be good
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.720]   and perhaps even lie at the heart of our ability
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.140]   to recover from depression.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.680]   This is a drug that blocks neuroplasticity,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.620]   but somehow is relieving depression.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.600]   I'm going to walk away from that.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.400]   I'm going to work on something far simpler.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.240]   And then there's this other category of scientists,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.940]   which, thank goodness, exists,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.160]   who looks at that apparent contradiction of,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.440]   okay, there's a drug which blocks plasticity.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.600]   Plasticity is thought to be important
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.640]   for getting over depression,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.760]   and yet the drug can provide some relief from depression,
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.800]   at least in these preclinical animal models,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.020]   and they say, hmm, I like a good puzzle, right?
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.280]   The more complex the puzzle, the more interesting,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.920]   and they start digging in with preclinical studies,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.640]   and they start talking to clinicians
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.740]   who are treating patients for depression.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.800]   And like I said, thank goodness
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.200]   these sorts of scientists exist,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.160]   and thank goodness they did that,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   because it turned out that when clinicians tried ketamine
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   in depressed patients as a means to relieve depression,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   it had remarkable effects.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.600]   So it was about the year 2000
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.640]   when the first sets of papers
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.400]   about the clinical use of ketamine
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.980]   for the treatment of depression started to emerge.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.480]   Now, we have to remember the context
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.220]   in which all of this was happening.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.500]   You know, in 2000, drugs like Prozac
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.400]   and some of the similar SSRIs,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.520]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.000]   things like Wellbutrin,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.760]   were really hitting the market in full force.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.860]   And as we talked about earlier,
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.360]   some people were getting relief,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.800]   some people were getting relief with a lot of side effects
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.380]   and therefore deciding not to take those drugs,
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.220]   and a lot of people,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.200]   the majority of people that were taking those drugs
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.500]   were not getting relief.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.440]   So there was a real urgent need to find other drugs
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.720]   for the treatment of depression.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.840]   And ketamine, at least based on its apparent profile
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   of being a dissociative anesthetic,
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.080]   would seem like the last drug
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.560]   that you'd want to use to treat depression, right?
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.800]   It dissociates people.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   You even hear about dissociation as a symptom of depression.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.520]   And yet what happened was
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.200]   a small number of very pioneering clinicians
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.920]   started to explore the use of ketamine in the clinic
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.280]   for the treatment of depression,
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.420]   and in particular for depression
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.600]   that did not respond to any other treatment.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.680]   So there was a real critical need to find other compounds
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.140]   and a bit more motivation to test some of these,
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.600]   let's call them atypical compounds
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.320]   for the treatment of depression.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.960]   So one of the first landmark papers
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.880]   in the use of ketamine for the treatment of depression
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.600]   is entitled "Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.960]   in Depressed Patients."
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.600]   This is a paper that I've provided a link to
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.840]   in the show note captions.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.480]   It's a small study, okay?
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.360]   So it doesn't involve many subjects at all,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.040]   really just has seven subjects,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.760]   all of whom had major depression.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.100]   And they did intravenous injections
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.380]   with half a milligram per kilogram
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.580]   of body weight of ketamine.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.420]   Now that dosage,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.160]   half a milligram per kilogram of body weight
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.540]   turns out to be very important for today's discussion
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.000]   because it's going to serve as a reference point
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.320]   for later discussions
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.880]   when we get into other modes of delivery of ketamine,
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.440]   such as oral pill form ketamine or sublingual ketamine.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.920]   And as it relates to things like the K-hole
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.360]   or the dissociative state
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.160]   or the various effects that ketamine can have
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.920]   depending on the dosage and the delivery route.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.320]   Meanwhile, going back to this study,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.440]   what they found is that when they injected patients
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.640]   with severe depression with ketamine,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.920]   the effects of ketamine took place within minutes,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.640]   within 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.880]   and that they experienced a sort of peak euphoric state,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.440]   okay, so they're not inducing deep anesthesia,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.280]   right, at this dosage.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.440]   They're getting people into a kind of euphoric, dreamy,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   semi-dissociative state.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.600]   That occurred within 15 minutes and really peaked
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.180]   about 45 minutes to an hour
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.920]   after they were injected with the drug.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.960]   And that the total effects of the drug in terms of euphoria
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.100]   were effectively over by about two hours or so.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.420]   And that time course of effects makes perfect sense
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.320]   if you look at, say, the half-life of ketamine,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.300]   which is how long it takes for half of the drug
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.340]   to be active in the system, et cetera.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.720]   But what was really interesting about this study
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.980]   and others like it is that the patients experienced relief
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.040]   from their depression almost immediately
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.240]   after taking the drug, so within minutes to hours,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.280]   and that it persisted for several days
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.040]   after taking the ketamine, okay?
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.040]   So the dissociative euphoric, dreamlike effects of ketamine
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.540]   take place very quickly.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.200]   They're very, very salient, right?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.020]   The person basically is just lying there,
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.220]   experiencing this euphoric, dreamlike dissociative state,
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.380]   and they get some relief from their depression immediately.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.160]   And yet there's persistent relief from that depression,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.680]   which lasted at least three days out from the treatment.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.120]   Now, a key theme of today's discussion is going to be
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.240]   that the antidepressant effects of ketamine
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.680]   appear to be fairly short-lived,
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.520]   at least when one is exploring
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.500]   one or two treatments with ketamine.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.820]   In other words, the typical contour
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.560]   is that people will take ketamine,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.220]   get this euphoric, dreamlike dissociative effect,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.680]   come out of that feeling some immediate relief
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.520]   from their depression.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.060]   This is one of the things that makes ketamine
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.920]   an incredibly attractive drug
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.700]   for the treatment of depression,
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.500]   especially depression that hasn't responded
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.020]   to other forms of treatment,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.640]   which is that people get relief very, very quickly,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.720]   indeed the same day that they initiate the treatment.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.120]   Now, this is especially important
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.580]   when you think about the fact
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.520]   that the monoamine hypothesis of depression,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   which drove the discovery and development
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.360]   of all these drugs like SSRIs, wellbutrin, et cetera,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.640]   those drugs often can provide support
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.680]   for people with depression.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.800]   Again, only 40% of people get true relief
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.080]   from their depression.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.680]   And again, there are some side effect issues
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.420]   or major side effect issues in some cases
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.940]   that have to be dealt with.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.940]   But even the positive effects,
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.200]   even under the best conditions,
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   oftentimes those effects don't kick in for weeks or months
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.880]   after somebody initiates taking the drug.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.600]   Now, that might not seem like a long time to wait
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.940]   for some of you,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.500]   but if you are somebody suffering from depression,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.520]   even another day, even another hour with depression
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.160]   seems almost unmanageable.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.440]   And sadly, many people who have these forms of depression
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.900]   will go on to commit suicide.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.600]   So it is ever so important
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.780]   that there be rapid treatments for depression,
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.040]   even same day treatments for depression.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.380]   And based on this study, it appeared that ketamine was,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.100]   and indeed still remains, that drug.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.720]   Now, I certainly don't want to position ketamine in your mind
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.620]   as a miracle drug for depression.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.940]   In fact, I don't actually believe in miracle drugs.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.760]   I don't think that there is any compound
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.360]   that alone can produce all the desired effects
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.100]   that one wants without any negative effects
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.600]   in a way that could warrant calling it a miracle drug.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.360]   That's just not how biology works.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.240]   There's always an interplay between pharmacology,
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.120]   between our behaviors and what we choose to do or not do.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.800]   This is a topic we'll get into a little bit later
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.000]   when we talk about antidepressant behaviors
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   and the role of ketamine
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.680]   in bringing about antidepressant behaviors
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.280]   for the relief of depression.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.480]   Now, with that said, the study that I just mentioned,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.380]   as well as many, many other studies that followed,
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.500]   emphasized that ketamine could provide
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.060]   significant decreases in not just depression and suicidality,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.580]   but also the feelings of helplessness and worthlessness
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.000]   that are associated with major depression.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.660]   And again, it could do that in people
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.020]   that also were not responding
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.160]   to other forms of depression treatment,
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.740]   such as SSRIs, et cetera.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.840]   So while we don't want to call it a miracle drug,
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.480]   ketamine turned out to be and remains an incredible drug
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.240]   for the treatment of depression in certain cases.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   Now, in addition to that,
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.440]   ketamine has been shown in clinical studies
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.380]   to provide relief not just for treatment-resistant
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.880]   depression of the major depression type, right?
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.800]   There's many different forms of depression,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.760]   but major depression is the one
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.340]   that we're normally thinking about or referring to
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.040]   when we talk about depression.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.220]   But ketamine has also been shown to be effective
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.400]   in treating bipolar depression,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.160]   sometimes called bipolar disorder,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.240]   although more commonly nowadays called bipolar depression.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.600]   I did an entire episode, by the way,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.720]   on bipolar depression.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.800]   If you want to know what it is and what it isn't,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.080]   how it differs from borderline personality disorder,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.340]   et cetera, you can go to Hubermanlab.com,
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.320]   just put into the search function bipolar,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.560]   and it will take you to that episode.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.080]   Ketamine has also been shown to be useful
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.760]   for the treatment of PTSD
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.000]   and for OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.800]   and for anxiety and for various forms of substance addiction.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.560]   So ketamine is not a miracle drug,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   but it does seem to have broad application
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.460]   and to be very successful for the treatment
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.100]   of a lot of major psychiatric challenges.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.600]   Now, just because ketamine has shown
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.500]   these incredible applications,
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.560]   it also has some serious problems
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.540]   that are directly related to how it works in the brain,
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.920]   or at least from what we understand
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.480]   of how it works in the brain.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.240]   And what I'm referring to here is,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.520]   yes, ketamine is very rapid acting.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.920]   It can often provide relief from depression
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.640]   almost immediately, meaning same day.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.060]   However, it is very short-lived.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.480]   After about three days or a week or so,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.320]   the antidepressant effects of ketamine often wear off.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.640]   So that creates a situation
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.180]   where people perhaps need to take ketamine every week,
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.740]   and yet it creates enough of a dissociative state,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.500]   meaning it takes people enough
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.520]   out of their normal daily routine,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.800]   that the prospect of people taking ketamine every week
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.480]   is actually not that feasible.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.280]   And also because of some of the propensity
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.960]   for ketamine to become a drug of abuse,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.840]   that is for it to be habit forming and/or addicting.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.740]   One also worries that if people are doing ketamine
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.260]   every week to treat their depression,
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.700]   that they can become so-called hooked on ketamine.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.960]   Now, fortunately, there have been studies of ketamine
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.120]   and how it works, not just in the short term,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.780]   but in the longer term,
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.800]   that have led to some very important clinical studies
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.360]   that have explored, for instance,
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.960]   people taking ketamine twice per week
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.680]   for a duration of three weeks total.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.260]   And what they find is that,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.100]   yes, after the first time they take it,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.740]   they get some relief from depression.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.940]   They take it a second time that week,
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.400]   they get some relief from depression.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.840]   And they do the same thing the next week and the next week.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.680]   And when they do that,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.580]   they get relief from depression the whole way through,
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.560]   that entire three weeks.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.500]   But it turns out that there's also
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.000]   some so-called durability to the effect,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.020]   such that if people do this twice a week dosing regimen,
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.700]   so ketamine twice a week for three weeks total,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.060]   they find that when they end that three weeks,
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.120]   they get some ongoing relief from their depressive symptoms,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.520]   which can extend months or more
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.320]   before they have to repeat the twice a week
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.040]   for three weeks regimen.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.480]   Now, certainly not all studies of using ketamine
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.600]   for the treatment of depression
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.400]   have used that exact dosage regimen.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.020]   Twice a week for three weeks and take some time off, repeat.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.320]   Twice a week for three weeks, take some time off, repeat.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.480]   Some have explored giving ketamine once per week
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.280]   or even three times per week,
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.000]   or doing it once a week for five weeks
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.200]   and then taking an extended period of time off
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.160]   before repeating the treatment schedule.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.200]   There are a bunch of different studies out there,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.360]   but when one looks at all of those studies
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.660]   and mass together, it's very clear
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.820]   that ketamine is providing relief from depressive symptoms
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.040]   immediately and in the days after the treatment,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.100]   but that when those treatments
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.160]   are stacked fairly closely together,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.540]   that there is some durability,
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.740]   some ongoing relief from depression.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.940]   And what this tells us is very important.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.660]   In fact, I hope everybody really highlight this
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.420]   in their minds as they're hearing it.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.040]   It's very likely that ketamine is acting by at least two
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.680]   and probably three different mechanisms
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.260]   in order to provide relief from depression.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.000]   One of those mechanisms induces relief from depression
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.440]   very quickly and seems to be associated
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.880]   with that euphoric dissociative dreamlike state
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.980]   that one experiences
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.380]   when they are under the influence of ketamine.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.540]   The second mechanism seems to provide relief from depression
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.900]   in the days and weeks that follow the ketamine treatment.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.720]   And there also appears to be a third mechanism
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.480]   by which ketamine can induce long-lasting changes
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.420]   in the nervous system.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.180]   And it is those three mechanisms,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.480]   short, medium, and long-term mechanisms
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.900]   that produce the kinds of changes in neurochemistry
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.340]   and more importantly,
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.300]   changes in actual neural circuit wiring
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.220]   that allows ketamine to provide
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.340]   this incredible relief from depression.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.700]   So next, we're going to turn to what those mechanisms are
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.320]   because in understanding those mechanisms,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.980]   you will understand how ketamine
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.900]   provides this relief from depression,
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.460]   but you'll also come to understand
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.520]   the more important broader theme
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.080]   of what depression is really all about
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.420]   at a neural circuit level
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.820]   and how relief from depression is all about neuroplasticity.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.720]   As many of you know,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.400]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.860]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.160]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.000]   that's designed to meet
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.220]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.860]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.140]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.400]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.060]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.040]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.800]   and the probiotics that I need
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.980]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.780]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.300]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.540]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.400]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.100]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.680]   I answer AG1.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.180]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.320]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.860]   From now until August 12th, 2023,
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.220]   AG1 is giving away 10 free travel packs
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.940]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.360]   Again, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.380]   you can claim the special offer of 10 free travel packs
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.340]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.460]   So how is ketamine really working?
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.660]   We already established that ketamine blocks
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.000]   the NMDA receptor and that the NMDA receptor is critical
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.620]   for many forms, not all, but many forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.360]   Now I realize some of you might be familiar
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.740]   with so-called ligands and receptors,
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.660]   but most of you probably are not.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.160]   A ligand is a chemical that binds to a receptor
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.780]   and a receptor is like a little parking spot
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.080]   on the outside of a cell.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.520]   There can also be receptors inside of cells,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.980]   but most of the time when we're talking about nerve cells,
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.500]   neurons, and you hear the word receptors,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.360]   you're hearing about receptors on the outside of the cell.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.980]   So the NMDA receptor does not exist in our neurons
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.560]   in order to bind ketamine.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.640]   It's there actually to bind all sorts of other things
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   that are endogenous, that are naturally made by us.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.240]   But ketamine has a very high, what's called affinity,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   has a very high probability of binding to the NMDA receptor
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.280]   if it's introduced to our bloodstream.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.880]   So when ketamine is taken in pill form,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.720]   sublingual form, meaning under the tongue,
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.260]   when it's injected into the muscle or the vein,
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.220]   it gets into the bloodstream and then it's able
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.660]   to cross easily across the blood brain barrier,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.920]   the so-called BBB, blood brain barrier.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.700]   The blood brain barrier keeps a lot of things
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.500]   out of the brain, but ketamine can very readily pass
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.540]   across the blood brain barrier.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.480]   Once it's in the brain, it has a very high affinity for,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.460]   meaning it knows how to seek out
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.980]   and bind to those NMDA receptors.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.340]   Now, the simplest way to explain how NMDA receptors
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.960]   ordinarily contribute to neuroplasticity
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.440]   is that they represent what's called an AND gate.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.000]   And an AND gate, as the name suggests,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.420]   is a function in a cell or in a system
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.960]   where two things have to be present.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.460]   In fact, for those of you that have a bit of an engineering
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.120]   or computer programming background,
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.460]   you'll be familiar with AND gates.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.340]   For those of you that don't, don't worry about it.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.820]   I'm going to explain what an AND gate is right now.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.860]   An AND gate in the context of nervous system function
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.540]   is when two things are present,
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.700]   like chemical A and chemical B both have to be present
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.380]   in order for some process, say neuroplasticity, to occur.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.460]   The NMDA receptor, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.340]   is a receptor on the surface of neurons
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.560]   and it binds glutamate,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.860]   which is a molecule that we all make in our brain,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.460]   and it activates other neurons.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.660]   It's what's called an excitatory neurotransmitter.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.620]   Now, there are lots of different receptors for glutamate
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.660]   and those receptors are binding glutamate all the time.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.020]   However, in order to activate the NMDA receptor,
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.160]   there has to be a lot of glutamate present
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.080]   and it has to happen over a very brief period of time.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.620]   So the NMDA receptor is an AND gate
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.420]   in the sense that glutamate has to be present
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.260]   and to bind it,
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.380]   and it has to get a lot of electrical activity,
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.480]   a lot of input in order for that to happen.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.340]   So it's a receptor that responds primarily
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.340]   to unusually high or frequent levels of electrical activity.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.280]   Let's place this in real-world context
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.820]   so that it makes a bit more sense.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.980]   I, like most all of you,
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.520]   am moving my arms around a lot throughout the day.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.620]   Now, as an adult, my motor cortex,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.540]   the area of my brain that controls
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.300]   motor coordination in my limbs,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.760]   has connections from my brain to my spinal cord,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.900]   from my spinal cord to my muscles,
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.660]   and that's what allows me to move my limbs.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.460]   Under conditions of just moving my limbs
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.500]   and doing things throughout the day,
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.340]   drinking a cup of coffee or yerba mate,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.940]   walking outside to view some sunlight in the morning,
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.620]   doing the things that I do every single day
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.000]   and that I already know how to do,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.860]   glutamate is definitely involved in that process.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.660]   Glutamate binding to its other receptor types,
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.060]   which are called AMPA receptors,
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.420]   for those of you that want to know,
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.000]   that's involved in that process.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.480]   It's typical levels of activity.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.560]   If, however, I were to sit down at this desk
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.540]   and be commanded to, or decide to,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.960]   do some specific motor limb movement,
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.900]   let's say move my hand in a three-dot sequence,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.200]   for those of you watching, you can see this,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.960]   for those of you that are listening, don't worry about it,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.440]   it's not very interesting to watch.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.080]   The point is just that I'm going to put my finger down
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.800]   in one, two, three points on the desk in front of me,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.200]   and then three, two, one points coming back to me.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.360]   Now, that's obviously a motor sequence that I can perform,
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.720]   I just did it, so clearly I can perform it.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.120]   But if I were to do that for, let's say, an hour,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.760]   what would happen is the neurons that are involved
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.080]   in generating that motor sequence of one, two, three,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.340]   three, two, one, one, two, three, three, two, one,
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.960]   would be active over and over and over again.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.000]   And what would likely happen, because of that unusual,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.080]   frankly, motor behavior, is that the neurons responsible
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   for generating that motor behavior would be able
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.060]   to detect it as unusually frequent,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.280]   unusually high levels of activity in the circuits
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.600]   that generate that behavior.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.680]   And the increase in glutamate that's impinging
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.760]   on the neurons in that circuit would bind the NMDA receptor,
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.800]   making it change several important things.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.240]   The first of which is that your nervous system
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.360]   is capable of changing,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.840]   but that's an energetically demanding process.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.160]   So the incredible thing about neuroplasticity
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.660]   is that when you generate an unusually high
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.040]   or just an unusual pattern of activity,
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.160]   motor activity, or you're hearing a new language,
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.980]   you're trying to learn that,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.760]   or you're navigating a new city,
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.680]   the neurons are firing in ways that are atypical for them,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.840]   and they are firing a lot more.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.960]   And so the neurons are going to bind glutamate,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.580]   the NMDA receptor is going to be activated,
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.480]   and then downstream of NMDA receptor activation
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.240]   are a bunch of what we call intracellular processes,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.840]   a bunch of things that happen in the cells
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.240]   to try and make that behavior occur again and again,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.320]   if needed, but without the huge energetic demand.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.380]   You've experienced this before
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.080]   when you're trying to learn something and it feels sluggish,
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.540]   it feels hard, it's frustrating,
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.960]   and then eventually you learn it and it's very facile,
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.600]   it's very easy.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.000]   One of the reasons for that
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.200]   is that when the NMDA receptor is activated
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.360]   by these infrequent or unusual patterns of activity,
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.240]   it can then recruit other glutamate receptors,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   the more typical kind,
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.880]   the AMPA-type receptors to the cell surface,
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.220]   and then those receptors can simply bind the glutamate
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.440]   and allow that behavior to occur
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.840]   without this whole process
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.560]   that's involved in neuroplasticity having to engage
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.280]   and do things like build new proteins in the cell,
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.060]   build new machinery, et cetera.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.440]   So to just step back from this,
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.720]   the way to think about the NMDA receptor
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.200]   is that activation of the NMDA receptor
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.080]   only occurs under conditions of unusually high
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.600]   or simply unusual patterns of activity,
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.040]   that the NMDA receptor, yes, controls neural activity
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.900]   in the immediate sense, like when it's activated,
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   it's changing the patterns of activity in the neuron, sure,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.640]   but it also can engage gene expression
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.060]   and introduce new receptors to the cell,
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.920]   basically giving the cell the ability
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.360]   to then recreate the same patterns of activity
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.600]   without having to do it
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.540]   in such a metabolically demanding way.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.640]   In fact, a good analogy for all of this
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.120]   is the way that muscles can hypertrophy, right?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.540]   If you overload muscles properly
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.440]   through resistance training of any kind
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.000]   and then give them a period of rest,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.620]   there's recruitment of specific things to the muscle fibers
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.600]   as well as recruitment of changes in the nerves
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.640]   that innervate, that control the contraction of those muscles
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.520]   and then those muscles grow, they get stronger, et cetera,
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.800]   and they're able to function
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.360]   and use that new strength and new growth
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.920]   and you don't have to damage those muscle fibers
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.040]   or trigger those adaptations over and over again
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.800]   to maintain them because you have this new capability.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.200]   Now, I realize that's a lot of details
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.720]   about NMDA receptors and neuroplasticity,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.320]   but really if we needed to pick one biological mechanism
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.000]   that resides at the center
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.280]   of many, many important forms of neuroplasticity,
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.920]   it would be the NMDA receptor
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.160]   and its functions that I just told you about.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.800]   So now that you have that in mind
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.720]   that these NMDA receptors are critical
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.500]   at detecting unusual activity, making changes to cells
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.560]   so the cells can then respond to that activity in the future,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.300]   you have in mind the conceptual basis
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.840]   for understanding how ketamine works
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.080]   because as I've mentioned several times already,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.600]   ketamine is an NMDA receptor blocker, antagonist,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.280]   and yet we know that a lot of the changes in the brain
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.080]   that underlie the transition from a depressed state
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.640]   to a non-depressed state involve neuroplasticity.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.220]   So what's going on there?
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.920]   Well, what's going on there turns out
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.640]   to be extremely interesting
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.280]   and you can understand it very easily
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.220]   if you understand that there are essentially
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.260]   two major types of neurons in the brain.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.200]   You have those excitatory neurons,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.060]   meaning neurons that when they are activated electrically,
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.800]   they activate or excite other neurons,
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.720]   at least they try to.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.000]   They release neurotransmitter into the synapse,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.360]   which is the little gap between neurons.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   The neurons on the other side have receptors.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.880]   They bind those neurotransmitters, in this case, glutamate,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.360]   which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain,
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.580]   and then there's a high probability
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.280]   that those other neurons will be excited,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.860]   that they will be electrically active.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.320]   That's one major type
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.760]   of so-called neurotransmission in the brain.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.300]   The other major type of neurotransmission in the brain
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.940]   is called inhibitory neurotransmission.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.720]   Inhibitory neurotransmission involves neurons
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.400]   that release the neurotransmitter GABA,
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.900]   or sometimes also another molecule called glycine,
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.920]   but mostly GABA.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.000]   When GABA is released,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.900]   it has the property of reducing the probability
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.360]   that the next neuron will be electrically active.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.920]   In fact, GABA's job is to bind to receptors on the next cell
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   and to make it less electrically active.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.240]   So we've got excitatory neurotransmission
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.360]   and we have inhibitory neurotransmission.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.880]   And just to place inhibitory
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.960]   and excitatory neurotransmission into context,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.720]   if you think about a condition like epilepsy,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.000]   which involves seizures of either the smaller type
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.440]   called petit mal seizures or grand mal seizures,
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.640]   which are the type in which people have
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.660]   body-wide convulsions.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.720]   They are often disengaged from whatever's going on
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   around them in those moments.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.640]   They're shaking quite a lot, et cetera.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.080]   There are many causes of seizures,
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.840]   but to get to the heart of what a seizure is,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.480]   it is essentially runaway excitation in the brain.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.760]   A small region of the brain
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.920]   becomes especially electrically active,
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.140]   and then it spreads out from that foci,
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.440]   that focus of the excitation.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.680]   And it recruits a lot of neurons
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.120]   in a fairly nonspecific way,
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.920]   creating these seizure-like motor patterns in the body
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.400]   and patterns of activity in the brain
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   that can involve disengagement from immediate experience
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.920]   and lack of perception.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.040]   Sometimes there's aura.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.880]   There's a whole discussion to be had about seizure.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.300]   And by the way, seizure can occur
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.800]   in a lot of different contexts.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.360]   Of course, it can occur in epilepsy,
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.520]   it can occur after a head injury, et cetera.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.320]   We'll cover seizure in a future episode
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.960]   of this podcast, of course.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.220]   But one of the major causes of seizure,
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.580]   and by extension, lack of seizure,
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.900]   is that ordinarily inhibitory neurons
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.620]   and excitatory neurons are in this kind of push-pull
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.900]   that for somebody that doesn't experience seizures
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.280]   puts the brain in balance.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.460]   So they don't have seizures, right?
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.820]   The inhibitory neurons are suppressing the activity
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.960]   of many neurons so that those many neurons
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.540]   don't get runaway excitation.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.020]   You don't get seizures.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.760]   The excitatory neurons are feeding back
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.060]   onto the inhibitory neurons,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.580]   so everything is kept in balance.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.780]   There isn't too much inhibition.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.060]   There isn't too much excitation.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.300]   Everything's in balance.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.720]   Okay, so now you understand that there are NMDA receptors,
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   and these are critical for many forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.940]   You also understand that there are excitatory neurons,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.900]   which stimulate the electrical activity of other neurons,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.740]   and that there are inhibitory neurons in your brain
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.980]   that inhibit or suppress the activity of other neurons,
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.940]   and that you need excitatory and inhibitory communication
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.500]   between neurons at all times,
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.460]   and that it has to remain in balance,
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.940]   and that the NMDA receptor is normally
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.660]   just sort of sitting there, not doing a whole lot,
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.540]   unless levels of neural activity are elevated
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.560]   above their normal baseline,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.380]   and then you can get changes in the neural circuits,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.220]   and those changes can be very long-lasting.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.780]   And let's not forget the piece of information
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.660]   most pertinent to today's discussion,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.020]   which is about ketamine,
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:10.080]   which is that ketamine blocks that NMDA receptor.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.980]   And there's the conundrum I keep coming back to,
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.000]   which is you need neuroplasticity
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.740]   in order to get relief from depression.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.020]   So what researchers have discovered is that,
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.980]   yes, ketamine blocks the NMDA receptor.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.400]   It actually quiets down neurons.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   It prevents neurons from being as active
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.680]   as they normally would be,
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.540]   and yet somehow, almost paradoxically,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.480]   it increases neuroplasticity in brain circuits
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.200]   that are involved in mood, in reward, in self-reflection.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.720]   We'll get into what those brain circuits are
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.340]   in a little bit.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.440]   The way it works is that ketamine binds
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.540]   to the NMDA receptor present on inhibitory neurons,
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.640]   and in doing so, dramatically reduces the amount
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.780]   of inhibition coming from those inhibitory neurons
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.080]   onto excitatory neurons.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   When that happens, the excitatory neurons
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.040]   in specific circuits of the brain
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.900]   are allowed to increase their activity.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.600]   They do what's called bursting.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.760]   Bursting is a pattern of electrical activity
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.400]   whereby normally one of these excitatory neurons
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.160]   is releasing glutamate in a pattern
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.320]   that might look or sound like this.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.560]   It actually doesn't make a sound in the brain,
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.360]   but if you were to record from one of these neurons,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.180]   which people have done many times over,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.440]   and then you were to convert the electrical signal
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.480]   in those neurons to an audio monitor,
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.580]   you would hear the firing,
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.240]   the action potential of those neurons as a kk.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.200]   That's what it actually sounds like on the audio monitor.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.640]   It sounds like a little bit of static, kk,
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.240]   but if the normal firing of the neuron is kk, kk, kk,
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.540]   which is the pretty typical baseline firing
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.920]   of the neurons and the relevant circuits to mood
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.700]   that I'm going to be discussing,
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.200]   under conditions where ketamine
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.680]   has been brought into the system,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.040]   binds that NMDA receptor,
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.040]   blocks the output of those inhibitory neurons
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.720]   onto the excitatory neuron,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.800]   now the excitatory neuron is firing in bursts.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.560]   [imitates burst]
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.840]   And those bursting patterns of electrical activity
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.920]   are the absolute perfect patterns of activity
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.800]   that induce not just short-term,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.160]   but long-term changes in the neural circuits
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.040]   associated with reward, with dopamine release,
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.360]   with disappointment, and with mood
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.760]   in ways that are directly relevant to suppressing
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.080]   or providing relief from the symptoms of major depression.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.680]   Now, I realize what I just told you is a lot of information.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.200]   In fact, what I just described represents
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.580]   essentially what I would teach
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.440]   to an advanced undergraduate/graduate course,
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.360]   medical school course on neuroplasticity
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.780]   and how ketamine works.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.820]   So keep in mind that we're having a discussion here
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.780]   that is at a fairly high level.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.420]   And if you could understand even a tiny fraction,
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.640]   even just one bit of what I just described,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.480]   you're doing great.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.680]   If you could understand more, outstanding.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.600]   Just to make sure that everyone's on the same page
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.960]   as we move forward, because I do want to make sure
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.880]   that everyone understands ketamine and how it works,
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.480]   because it does have these sort of cryptic functions
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.660]   of engaging neuroplasticity in ways that aren't obvious.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.260]   If you just ask, what does ketamine do when you inject it?
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.420]   What does ketamine produce in terms of a feeling state?
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.000]   And then how does somebody get relief from depression?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.160]   That can all start to get a little bit muddled
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.500]   unless you understand the following.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.800]   So I'm going to tell it to you again
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.500]   in just very top contour terms.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.200]   Somebody takes a pill or an injection or sublingual ketamine.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.880]   It makes its way into the bloodstream,
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.840]   and then it makes its way into the brain.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.720]   Once it's in the brain, it binds to a particular category
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.220]   of receptors called the NMDA receptor.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.240]   The NMDA receptor is a receptor
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.080]   that normally is quiescent.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.120]   It's just kind of sitting there.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.760]   It doesn't tend to do a lot under normal conditions
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.840]   of everyday life.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.360]   However, the NMDA receptor's typical function, okay,
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.760]   so when there's no ketamine in the body or brain,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   is to detect abnormal levels of neural activity.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.200]   And in doing so, recruit changes to cells,
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.080]   receptors, et cetera, literally change the neurons
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.360]   in ways that allow them to respond to that activity
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.560]   in the future without having to be
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.120]   under such big metabolic demand.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.800]   And they do that by recruiting more receptors, et cetera,
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.300]   much in the same way as when you overload a muscle
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.880]   in the gym, it will eventually recover
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.200]   if you allow it to recover,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.240]   and it will get stronger through the addition
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.360]   of a bunch of new proteins, the nerve communication
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.840]   of that muscle will change,
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.160]   the muscle and the nerve to muscle connection change.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.720]   It gets stronger, and sometimes it gets bigger and stronger.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.480]   In the same way, a neuron can change the way it functions
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.320]   in response to experience,
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.720]   and neurons don't know experience of life in any other way
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.880]   except the patterns of electrical activity
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.480]   and chemical activity that impinges on them, okay?
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.240]   Now, ketamine, the drug, binds to
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.460]   and blocks that NMDA receptor.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.780]   So the obvious conclusion would be that ketamine
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.460]   prevents neuroplasticity, and that's not what happens.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.620]   We know that ketamine actually induces neuroplasticity,
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.400]   and it does so specifically in the brain circuits
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.260]   that control mood,
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.980]   the net consequence being improvements in mood.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.860]   How does that happen?
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.200]   It happens because ketamine binds to and blocks
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.900]   those NMDA receptors on inhibitory neurons.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.500]   The inhibitory neurons are the neurons
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.600]   that normally suppress the activity of other neurons.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.020]   So when ketamine binds to the NMDA receptor,
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.900]   the activity of those inhibitory neurons is reduced,
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.160]   and as a consequence, excitatory communication
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.440]   between neurons in those mood-related circuits increases.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.660]   And it increases it in a way that recruits neuroplasticity,
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.820]   that strengthens those connections,
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.140]   and makes them more likely to be active in the future.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.880]   Now, it is not the case, at least at clinical doses,
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.300]   that ketamine induces seizures.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.400]   It certainly can at higher doses.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.500]   But at clinical doses, when ketamine suppresses
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.180]   the activity of those inhibitory neurons
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.920]   and the excitatory neurons ramp up their activity,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.020]   they're ramping up their activity a lot
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.620]   and enough to create changes
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.700]   in those neural circuits associated with mood.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.060]   And the changes are in the direction
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.620]   of making those neural circuits
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.860]   more likely to generate positive mood
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.000]   and less likely to generate negative mood.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.980]   We'll get into the specifics
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.180]   of those circuits in a little bit.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.220]   But ketamine is not creating the kind of enormous increases
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.320]   in excitatory communication between neurons
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.720]   that leads to that runaway excitation.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.320]   Now, the point of the discussion we just had
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.600]   over the last 10 minutes or so was several-fold.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.580]   First of all, I do believe it's important to understand
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.980]   the key components of neuroplasticity,
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.680]   which is this remarkable feature
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.580]   of our brain and nervous system that we all have, right?
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.260]   This ability to change our own brain circuits.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.200]   No other organ in the body, as far as we know,
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.500]   can direct its own changes,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.820]   but we can direct our own brain changes.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.900]   And the NMDA receptor is absolutely critical for that.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.660]   I also think it's important to understand the difference
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.260]   between inhibitory and excitatory communication
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.100]   between neurons, because that's just central
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.940]   to understanding brain function.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.540]   Brain function is a series of accelerators and breaks.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.980]   It's not all about neurons stimulating other neurons.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.620]   It's also about neurons preventing
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.140]   the activation of other neurons.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.660]   That's just central to everything,
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.260]   not just preventing seizures, but it's central to learning.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.780]   It's central to vision.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   It's central to hearing.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.860]   It's central to creativity.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.500]   It is at the core of brain function.
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.280]   And the other reason to have the discussion we just did
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.140]   is that ketamine has this incredible property.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.040]   It can literally change the neural circuits
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.560]   that generate mood,
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.760]   that generate your feelings of wellbeing,
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.900]   but it does so through a somewhat convoluted pathway, right?
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.100]   It blocks the receptor
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.180]   that everyone thinks is involved in neuroplasticity,
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.460]   and in doing so, it actually creates neuroplasticity.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.740]   Now, even though I just described all of that to you
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.080]   over the last 10 minutes or so,
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.060]   keep in mind that what I just described to you
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.120]   as a process that actually occurs in the brain
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.780]   takes many, many days.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.060]   It involves cells changing gene expression,
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.620]   making new proteins, new receptors.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.560]   Anytime we say neuroplasticity,
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.620]   even when you read about so-called
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.440]   short-term neuroplasticity,
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.460]   it is happening over the course of at least many, many hours
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.200]   and more likely many days or even weeks.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.620]   So the process I just described
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.980]   of how ketamine creates neuroplasticity
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.100]   through blockade of NMDA receptors
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.080]   is very likely to be the process
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:18.020]   that explains the longer-term changes in mood and affect
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.500]   that are associated with ketamine therapy
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.360]   for the treatment of depression.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.660]   Now, it is possible that ketamine
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.220]   blocking the NMDA receptor is also responsible
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.340]   for some of the immediate effects of ketamine
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.900]   that people experience when they take the drug,
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.180]   the dissociation, in some cases, euphoria,
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.940]   and that sort of dream-like state
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.880]   that it can put people into.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.180]   That is possible,
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.700]   but it's very clear that the NMDA receptor blockade
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.720]   is critical for the neuroplastic changes
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.860]   that are going to occur over the days and weeks
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.420]   following ketamine treatment.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.940]   And if you think back to our earlier discussion,
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.540]   when we were talking about the two-time-a-week,
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.580]   over three-week-type regimen of taking ketamine
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.500]   or some variant on that,
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.440]   now it might start to make sense as to why,
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.300]   yes, there is immediate and short-term benefit
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.900]   of taking ketamine for depression
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.580]   in the clinically appropriate setting.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.440]   Of course, I'm not talking about recreational use right now,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.820]   but that also there's some durability of those effects
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.600]   that even after the three weeks
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.700]   of taking ketamine twice per week,
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.680]   people often will experience weeks or months
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.880]   of relief from depression
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.460]   when they're not doing the weekly ketamine therapy sessions.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.660]   So that longer-term relief
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.560]   that I'm referring to as durability of the treatment
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.320]   is very likely to be the consequence
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.820]   of actual neural circuit rewiring.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.960]   Now, there's an additional and very important facet
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.220]   to this whole discussion about neuroplasticity
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.060]   in response to ketamine treatment for depression.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.700]   If you recall the, [imitates explosion]
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:47.760]   the burst firing that induces that plasticity,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.940]   I told you it induces plasticity, but I didn't tell you how.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.320]   Now, you already could imagine some of the mechanisms.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.060]   It could be insertion of those new glutamate receptors,
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.140]   those AMPA receptors that we talked about.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.020]   However, even for that to happen,
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.260]   a bunch of other things have to happen first.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.460]   But one of the key ones to understand
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.960]   is the thing I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.520]   BDNF, which stands for brain-derived neutrophic factor.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.860]   Brain-derived neutrophic factor is an incredible molecule.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.280]   I should mention that it's one of many growth factors
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.040]   in the brain, and it has its own set of receptors.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.360]   It binds to something called the TRKB receptor,
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   T-R-K-B, TRKB receptor.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.360]   When BDNF binds to TRKB receptors on neurons,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.840]   it does a lot of things.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.760]   It sets off a whole cascade of things,
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.740]   including the insertion of new glutamate receptors
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.460]   so that those neurons become extra sensitive
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.000]   to any input they get.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.540]   And so that's one form of change that BDNF can create.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.020]   BDNF can also alter the overall shape of neurons.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.960]   It can cause neurons to grow new branches
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.320]   so that it can receive new inputs from other neurons.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.900]   Anytime BDNF is discussed in popular books
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.080]   or the popular press, people will talk about it
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.200]   as quote unquote fertilizer for neurons.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.440]   I don't really like that term because it really undervalues
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.560]   the total number of things that BDNF can do.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.240]   BDNF actually can act as its own kind of neurotransmitter.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.960]   It can actually stimulate other neurons,
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.560]   and it does a bunch of other things.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.840]   But for sake of this discussion about ketamine,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.220]   understand that that burst firing of neurons,
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:23.800]   that very high frequency firing of neurons
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.120]   can invoke the release of BDNF in ways
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.840]   that make those circuits very plastic very quickly.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.480]   And in addition to that, there's some evidence
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:37.160]   that ketamine itself may be able to cause release
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.200]   of BDNF directly without having to go through
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.400]   all of the mechanisms that I overwhelmed you with
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.440]   a few minutes ago, or hopefully didn't overwhelm you with,
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.240]   but that I taught to you a few minutes ago.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.280]   Now, what's especially exciting about BDNF
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.360]   in the context of ketamine therapy for depression
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.220]   is that it appears based on both preclinical
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:00.800]   and clinical studies that BDNF isn't just one of the ways
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.320]   in which ketamine can invoke neuroplasticity
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.100]   and these improvements in mood.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.840]   It may actually be required.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.000]   It may be the central process to all of that.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.760]   Now, it can still be downstream of all that NMDA receptor
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   stuff that we talked about before,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.300]   but there are several lines of evidence that suggest
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.600]   that ketamine-induced release of BDNF
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.040]   is one of the core mechanisms by which ketamine
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.480]   can relieve depression.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.340]   Now, there are several lines of evidence to support
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.120]   what I just said about BDNF in the context of ketamine.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.640]   First of all, in mice that lack BDNF,
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.300]   they have no BDNF, they can't make BDNF
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.880]   because they don't have the gene for BDNF.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.240]   We call those BDNF knockout mice.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.860]   In those mice, if you give them ketamine
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.080]   and you put them into that learned helplessness task
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.780]   that we talked about a bit earlier,
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.220]   where you put them into water and see how long they swim,
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.600]   normally ketamine would allow a mouse to swim longer,
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.200]   to fight for its life longer.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.100]   Well, it no longer does that in a BDNF knockout mouse.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.860]   And the only thing that's different about that mouse,
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.560]   as far as we know, is the lack of BDNF.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.400]   And there are ways to make sure that it's lack of BDNF
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.120]   in the specific neurons that are relevant
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.240]   to everything we're talking about,
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.660]   not just that their limbs don't work as well, et cetera.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.460]   In other words, all the appropriate control experiments
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.420]   have been done.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:17.640]   That's preclinical data because it comes from animal models.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   In addition to that, depressed people
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.060]   who have a mutant form of BDNF.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.800]   So these humans are not knockouts for BDNF,
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.840]   they can make BDNF, but the BDNF doesn't function normally.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.120]   In those people, they have a very reduced response
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.640]   to ketamine treatment for depression,
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.160]   suggesting that BDNF action is at least
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.400]   one of the critical functions that allows ketamine
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.040]   to relieve depression.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.600]   And as I mentioned earlier, ketamine can actually invoke
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.400]   the release of BDNF and get this,
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.120]   there's some evidence that ketamine itself
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.600]   can bind to the TRKB receptor.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.260]   That is, it can bind to the BDNF receptor,
[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.320]   it can mimic BDNF.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.800]   So this is an entirely different way
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.600]   of thinking about ketamine than we normally hear about.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.080]   Nowadays, we hear a lot about ketamine
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.220]   and ketamine therapy.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.880]   We also hear, fortunately, about some of the problems
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.540]   of ketamine abuse, and we will talk about
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.280]   some of those concerns a little bit later.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.320]   And we hear about BDNF, this so-called brain fertilizer,
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.220]   but rarely, if ever, do we hear that ketamine itself
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.980]   can mimic the effects of BDNF in the brain.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.920]   But researchers and clinicians are definitely
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.140]   paying attention to this, and it's starting to raise
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.500]   what I consider a very exciting model
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.300]   of how ketamine could provide relief for depression,
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.600]   which is that it's acting as a growth factor in the brain,
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.520]   or at least it's mimicking the action of growth factors,
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.100]   allowing the specific neural circuits that control things
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.440]   like mood, outlook on the future, self-reflection, et cetera,
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.180]   allowing those circuits to change in ways
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.320]   that provide significant relief for major depression.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.240]   And in doing so, and this is a very important point,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.480]   it appears that ketamine is relieving depression
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.440]   in ways that are entirely different
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.380]   from any other kind of treatment.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.040]   Now, in an earlier episode about psilocybin
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.680]   and its potential role for the treatment of depression,
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.140]   I went into a lot of depth about how psilocybin
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.300]   can induce neuroplasticity to provide relief
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.360]   for major depression in certain individuals
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.060]   under certain conditions.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.800]   I do want to highlight that because, indeed,
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.360]   it's another case where neuroplasticity is involved.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.240]   But in that situation, as some of you may remember,
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.720]   or if you don't, don't worry, I'll tell you right now,
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.400]   it was a pretty straightforward model.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.240]   Psilocybin looks a lot like serotonin chemically,
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.380]   except that psilocybin binds a particular receptor.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.680]   When that receptor is bound,
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.280]   it allows these brain-wide changes.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.560]   Those brain-wide changes seem to change
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.160]   one's reflection on oneself, so-called ego dissolution,
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.500]   changes in mood that are stable over time,
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.440]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.040]   It was all pretty straightforward.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.240]   With ketamine, it's clear
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.480]   there are multiple mechanisms involved.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.240]   And perhaps most importantly, with ketamine,
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.680]   it's that immediate relief that occurs day of
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.280]   or close to day of treatment and in the days afterwards,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.680]   and it's that long-term relief that very likely
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.720]   is the consequence of NMDA receptor suppression,
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.760]   burst activity in neurons within these mood-related circuits,
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.600]   BDNF being released and changing neural circuits,
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.200]   strengthening them in order to give elevated mood
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.520]   as a consequence of that bursting activity,
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.000]   and ketamine mimicking BDNF.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.220]   In other words, ketamine acting more or less
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.880]   like a growth factor in the brain
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.440]   in order to make sure that whatever changes occur
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.240]   in those neural circuits to elevate mood are durable,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.360]   that they really are reinforced and last over time.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.940]   I'd like to just take a brief break
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.800]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.400]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.460]   and nothing you don't.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.080]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.920]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.740]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.600]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.280]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.480]   also called neurons.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.080]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.320]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.880]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.420]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.520]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.040]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.080]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.240]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.000]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.240]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.740]   and after physical training as well,
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.540]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.360]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.840]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.520]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.500]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.080]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.400]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.640]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.240]   So basically I've discussed two major mechanisms
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.580]   for how ketamine can induce neuroplasticity,
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.020]   leading to improvements in mood and affect
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.260]   that gives relief for depression.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.060]   Those two mechanisms are linked,
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.960]   or at the very least are happening in parallel,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.260]   they're happening at the same time in the brain.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.360]   Now, just to make matters more interesting,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.340]   there's an incredible twist into this whole thing
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.560]   of how ketamine works.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.860]   And when I say how ketamine works,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.500]   I'm not just talking about how ketamine provides relief
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.060]   for depression, I'm also talking about
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:13.200]   why people use ketamine for recreational purposes.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.940]   And it is the following.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:18.960]   Yes, ketamine has all these impacts on excitatory neurons,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.760]   inhibitory neurons, BDNF, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.560]   but ketamine can also bind receptors in the opioid pathway.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.200]   Now, what is the opioid pathway?
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.460]   Don't worry, here I'm not going to hit you
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   with a lot of details,
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.280]   but we've all heard of the opioid crisis by now,
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.200]   or at least most of you have.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.480]   The opioid crisis refers specifically
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.820]   to people taking exogenous opioids, taking opioids, right?
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.520]   So taking pills that activate particular receptors
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.500]   in the brain that lead to analgesia in some cases,
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.360]   so pain relief that lead to changes in mood.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.160]   There's a lot to be said about the opioid crisis.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.800]   It's called a crisis for a reason.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.100]   Many, many people are addicted to those compounds.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.520]   That's a discussion for another time.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.860]   Keep in mind that the receptors those drugs bind to
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.560]   are opioid receptors.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.100]   And those receptors that you and I all have, by the way,
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.860]   do not exist in order to bind drugs
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.840]   that are made by pharmaceutical companies.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.680]   They exist in our brain and body
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.780]   to bind to the so-called endogenous,
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.320]   naturally made opioids that we all make.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.840]   And those receptors have different names,
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.520]   the Mu opioid receptor, the Kappa opioid receptor, et cetera.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.580]   They tend to have the names of Greek letters
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.480]   to differentiate them.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   Now, ketamine can bind to various opioid receptors.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.880]   And when opioid receptors are bound,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.280]   we know that creates certain effects,
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.120]   things like pain relief,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.800]   things like changes in psychic states,
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   dissociation, for example.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.020]   If enough of them are bound, you can get euphoric states.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.160]   Under certain conditions of high dose binding of ketamine
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.680]   to those opioid receptors,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.820]   you can start getting into planes of anesthesia,
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.200]   where people lose consciousness
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.820]   and actually have no response to pain whatsoever.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.640]   If you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier,
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.120]   where ketamine was used to relieve depression,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.280]   well, the dosage used in that study, as you recall,
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.640]   was half a milligram per kilogram of body weight.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.840]   That is the dosage that will induce these dissociative,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.300]   mild euphoria, those sorts of states of mind,
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.440]   but where people are still conscious.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.400]   When you start getting to dosages of ketamine
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.540]   that are in the range of one to two milligrams
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.880]   per kilogram of body weight,
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   now you're talking about anesthetic doses.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.800]   And when that happens, you're going to get full parking,
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.200]   full saturation of all the potential receptors
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.840]   that ketamine can bind to those NMDA receptors.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.760]   It's going to block those.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.160]   It's also going to bind to the so-called
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.360]   mu-opioid receptors and maybe this other type as well,
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.460]   for those of you that want to know,
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.880]   you aficionados, also the kappa type opioid receptors.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.160]   And so what we've got here is a drug, ketamine,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.840]   that is hitting two different systems,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.880]   the glutamate-related system
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.560]   and the endogenous opioid system.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.160]   And researchers and clinicians have logically
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.680]   started to ask whether or not
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.800]   some or all of the effects of ketamine
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.400]   are due to the opioid system.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.440]   And they want to know which effects those are.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.560]   Now, this is where things start to get really interesting,
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.960]   both in the context of clinical treatment of depression
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.000]   and recreational use.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.960]   First of all, when people take ketamine,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.960]   again, it enters the bloodstream and it goes into the brain,
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.360]   but it is metabolized to something called HNK,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.040]   which is hydroxy nor ketamine.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.760]   Now, I don't expect you to know what hydroxy nor ketamine is
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.280]   and I don't expect you to care about it
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   until I tell you what I'm about to tell you,
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.200]   which is that hydroxy nor ketamine
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.080]   has an incredible specificity for the mu opioid receptor
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.660]   and maybe that kappa opioid receptor as well.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.480]   In other words, when we talk about ketamine,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.160]   that's the drug people take,
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.620]   but when it goes into the body,
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.200]   it's converted into yet another drug.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.480]   And that other drug, hydroxy nor ketamine,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.600]   is selectively activating the opioid system.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.940]   So this led researchers to ask a very important question,
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.700]   which is when a human being takes ketamine
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.760]   in order to treat their depression
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.360]   and they get some relief from depression,
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.980]   is that the consequence of neuroplastic changes
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.740]   in all those NMDA glutamate BDNF-related circuits
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.260]   that we talked about before?
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.100]   Or is it the consequence of something happening
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.620]   in the opioid system?
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.280]   You can't ignore the fact that ketamine has this property
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.400]   of binding to these opioid receptors
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.320]   because they have such a powerful effect on our thinking,
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.160]   on our mood, on our state of consciousness.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.680]   It's entirely reasonable that the opioid system
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.880]   could be a major player, if not the major player,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.840]   in this whole depression relief thing
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.840]   and maybe even in the creation of dissociative symptomology
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.960]   when people take ketamine recreationally.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.920]   So what researchers/clinicians did
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.540]   is they undertook a series of experiments
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.860]   where they gave people ketamine
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:54.500]   for the relief of depression,
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.560]   but they also blocked the opioid receptor system.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.440]   And they did that using a drug called naltrexone.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.780]   So what I'm about to describe to you
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.280]   is a study done by my colleagues
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.180]   namely Dr. Nolan Williams and Alan Schatzberg and colleagues
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.880]   entitled "Attenuation of Antidepressant
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.260]   and Antisuicidal Effects of Ketamine
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.760]   by Opioid Receptor Antagonism."
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.080]   And as a consequence of me reading you
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.500]   that title a moment ago,
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.360]   you now already have the conclusion of the study.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   What they observed is that when people were given ketamine,
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.600]   they got relief from depression.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.580]   That wasn't surprising.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.380]   Again, many studies had shown that before
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.060]   since the early 2000s.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.500]   If, however, individuals were given naltrexone
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.960]   to block the opioid receptor pathway
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.380]   and they were given ketamine,
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.580]   well then the antidepressant effects of ketamine
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.260]   were no longer observed.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.700]   Now that suggests that it is the opioid receptor system
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:50.300]   that's responsible for the antidepressant effects
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.140]   of ketamine.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.220]   And perhaps this HNK, this hydroxynorketamine,
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.100]   which is the metabolite of ketamine,
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.980]   is the way in which ketamine normally relieves depression.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.900]   Now, a lot of people took note of these studies
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:06.340]   because, after all, there are probably dozens,
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.420]   if not hundreds of studies,
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.640]   looking at the effects of ketamine
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.820]   on all that NMDA receptor stuff.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.860]   And indeed, neuroplasticity and mood-related circuits
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.340]   can't be discounted as one way
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.060]   in which ketamine provides relief from depression.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:22.680]   But what was very interesting is that
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.900]   in people given ketamine and naltrexone,
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.700]   those people still experienced
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.460]   the immediate effects of ketamine,
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.160]   the mild euphoria, the dissociation,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.260]   the feelings that one would normally expect
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.800]   when people were under the effects of ketamine,
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.200]   but what they didn't get were the longer-term changes in mood
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.100]   that we would call relief from depression.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.140]   Now, of course, the goal of modern psychiatry
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.620]   is to treat depression,
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.380]   not to block the effects of these drugs
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.220]   that are capable of treating depression.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.180]   Now, what this study does,
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.120]   and by the way, there are several studies like it
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.100]   that support these general set of findings
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.700]   that part of the critical role of ketamine
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.280]   in providing relief from depression
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.140]   is to activate the opioid system.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.300]   But what this study does is it really points to the fact
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.000]   that when we say ketamine treatment,
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.680]   or we talk about somebody taking ketamine recreationally,
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.700]   for that matter, we have to pay attention
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.520]   to what's happening
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.940]   while they are under the influence of the drug.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.700]   We also have to pay attention to what's happening
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.720]   in the days and weeks
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.620]   after they're under the influence of the drug.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.780]   And perhaps most importantly,
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.320]   this calls to mind a really important idea,
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.540]   which is that whether or not you're talking
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.880]   about ketamine-induced relief from depression
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.720]   or psilocybin-induced relief for depression
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.140]   or MDMA-induced relief for PTSD,
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.100]   a topic that I covered on a previous episode
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.480]   of this podcast,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.820]   we have to step back and look at the idea
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.760]   that the effects of the drug that people experience,
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.260]   whatever those may be,
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.640]   because obviously it's going to depend
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.180]   on what particular drug they took,
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.700]   those immediate effects may not actually be related
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.460]   to the long-term clinical benefit of those particular drugs.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.720]   Now, I realize that many people might not like that idea,
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.340]   and frankly, I don't actually think
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.300]   that's the way that it works.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.620]   I don't think it's going to be an either/or situation.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:05.800]   However, because drugs like ketamine, psilocybin, MDMA
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.020]   have such profound effects on people's psychic states
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.700]   when they are under the influence of them,
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.280]   and because at least in the proper clinical setting and use,
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.520]   they do seem to provide impressive relief
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.180]   from a lot of these psychiatric challenges
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.420]   like depression and PTSD,
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.060]   people naturally correlate those two things.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.160]   They couple those two things.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.820]   In fact, they collapse those two things
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.940]   and presume that their experience of what they saw,
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.320]   what they heard, how they felt
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.380]   while they were under the influence of the drug
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.580]   was actually the stimulus that created the relief
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.620]   from their clinical condition like depression.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.380]   But what these data on combined treatment
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.020]   with ketamine and naltrexone
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.160]   to block the mu opioid receptor really show us
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.320]   is that that may not actually be the way that it works.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.220]   It may be that the effects of a drug like ketamine
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.460]   that one experiences, while interesting,
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:59.020]   perhaps even profound, perhaps great insight
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.420]   comes to one when they do that therapy
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.580]   in the proper context,
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.840]   it is not clear at all that it is that experience
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.220]   and the effects of those drugs
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.280]   in those immediate minutes and hours
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.160]   that's actually what's causing the relief from depression.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.080]   Now, again, I don't think it's an either/or.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.580]   I like to view the whole situation
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.460]   more or less as a sort of wave front
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.580]   that the experience that one has subjectively
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.280]   while they are under the influence of a drug
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.480]   like ketamine or psilocybin or MDMA
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.020]   sets off a series, and in fact, multiple serieses.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.860]   Is that a word?
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:37.360]   Multiple types of processes in the brain,
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.180]   some of which rely on things like NMDA receptor,
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.980]   BDNF, et cetera, type neuroplasticity,
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.140]   others which rely on the opioid receptor pathway,
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.960]   and that each of these have different time courses
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.480]   such that some provide immediate relief
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.160]   in the days and hours after treatment,
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.240]   some in the weeks after treatment,
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.960]   and some more durable, long-lasting changes
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.940]   that can occur over months or maybe even years.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.740]   And a really important thing to underscore
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.340]   in the context of all this
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.360]   is that throughout today's discussion,
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.640]   we've been talking about drugs and receptors
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.280]   and relief from depression,
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.960]   but what we're really talking about here
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.180]   are people who get relief from depression
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.680]   and almost with certainty,
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.180]   when they get relief from depression,
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.220]   they are also starting to do other things.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.660]   They are going back to work.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.320]   They are engaging in relationships again.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.260]   They are viewing themselves differently again.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.680]   Hopefully they're getting morning sunlight
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.920]   and exercising and eating well
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.660]   and doing all the sorts of things
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.880]   that we would call anti-depressive behaviors.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.100]   And it is impossible to separate
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.600]   the positive behavioral consequences
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.740]   of a drug treatment for depression
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.120]   from the drug itself in a way that lets us say,
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.440]   okay, ketamine relieved depression,
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.700]   and then as a consequence,
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.140]   people went and did a bunch of behaviors
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:49.980]   that were healthy for them
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.240]   or stopped engaging in behaviors
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.480]   that were unhealthy for them.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.740]   So we can think of behaviors
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.120]   as pro-depressive or anti-depressive.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.720]   In fact, we know that one particular behavior
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.380]   that is viewing blue light in the middle of the night
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.160]   between the hours of say 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.720]   is known to invoke a pro-depressive circuit.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.360]   It involves a structure called the habenula.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.640]   I've talked about this on previous podcasts.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.940]   It tends to lower dopamine and increase cortisol,
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.420]   and the day is following that exposure to light, et cetera.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.940]   So there are pro-depressive behaviors
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.520]   and there are anti-depressive behaviors.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.280]   We know that viewing morning sunlight,
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.680]   getting regular and sufficient amounts of quality sleep,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.800]   proper nutrition, proper social engagement,
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.000]   there is now a plethora of quality research
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.960]   pointing to the fact
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.360]   that those are true anti-depressive behaviors.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.800]   So we can never separate out the effects of a drug
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.640]   from the effects of a drug that feed back on
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.260]   and combine with the effects of the drug
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:45.720]   that one is hoping for, in this case, depression relief.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   Okay, so I've been bookending this conversation
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.560]   about ketamine at two very divergent levels,
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.840]   meaning we've been talking about high-level stuff,
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.620]   relief from depressive symptoms, right?
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.540]   We haven't been going into a lot of detail about that,
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.400]   but that's pretty high level.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.960]   We're talking about thought changes, behavioral changes
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.000]   that we're calling anti-depressive, right?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.440]   Changes in mood and affect that are positive,
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.140]   positive anticipation of the future, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.740]   And then we've also been talking a lot at this other end,
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.960]   which is very reductionist,
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.680]   down at the cellular and molecular level.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.240]   We're talking about receptors and binding of receptors
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.480]   and neuroplasticity and TracB and all that stuff.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.720]   We've completely neglected,
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.260]   meaning I've completely neglected until now,
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.960]   what bridges those two levels of understanding?
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.200]   And what bridges those two levels of understanding
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.320]   are the neural circuits that actually change
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.940]   when one takes ketamine.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.640]   Whether or not those changes occur quickly,
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.800]   whether or not they take a longer period of time,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.800]   whether or not they involve NMDA receptors
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.760]   or the opioid receptor systems or both,
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.880]   we know that certain neural circuits change
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.600]   when people take ketamine in these patterns of dosage
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.880]   and frequency of about half a milligram per kilogram.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.480]   And again, that's the injected form,
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.760]   twice per week over three weeks,
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.640]   and then they get some durable resistance to depression.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.680]   Fortunately, we can talk about those neural circuits
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.120]   without having to bring about a lot more nomenclature,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.520]   a lot of new language.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.840]   And I say fortunately, because I realized today
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.100]   you've been hit with a lot of new terms.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.560]   Now I've already mentioned one of the key brain structures,
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.040]   and that's the habenula.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.720]   A few moments ago, I talked about the habenula
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.320]   in the context of people who get too much
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.440]   bright to light exposure in the middle of the night.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.900]   That activates the habenula.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.000]   It's a sort of a disappointment circuit.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.160]   We can call it that because we know that it leads
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.300]   to pro depressive symptoms in animal models
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.160]   and very likely in humans as well.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.960]   And it does so we know by reducing dopamine
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.520]   and increasing cortisol.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.200]   There's evidence that when people undergo ketamine therapy,
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.440]   connections between the habenula,
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.360]   what we can broadly just talk about as a structure involved
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.520]   in generating a feeling of disappointment,
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.460]   the connections between the habenula
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.480]   and the reward circuitry of the brain,
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.300]   which I've talked about several times before
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.140]   on this podcast,
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.800]   but for those of you that aren't familiar with it,
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.280]   this is the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.480]   as areas like the ventral tegmental area,
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.540]   the nucleus accumbens.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.640]   Don't worry at all about those names.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.720]   Just know that this is a brain area
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.020]   that is chock-a-block full of neurons that release dopamine,
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.420]   which is a molecule that tends to increase mood,
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.820]   increase motivation.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.380]   In many ways, we can think about it,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.260]   at least for sake of this discussion, as anti-depressive.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.480]   So what we've got is a structure, the habenula,
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.960]   that normally provides inhibitory,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.800]   and now you know what that means, inhibitory input
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.760]   to this reward pathway that releases dopamine.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.560]   And when people take ketamine,
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.160]   that inhibition is lessened such that the reward pathway
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.020]   is more available for engagement
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.800]   through daily life activities.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.240]   Now I say available for engagement
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:43.720]   through daily life activities for a very specific purpose,
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.740]   which is that all of the changes in neural circuits
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.580]   that we're talking about
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.800]   that can come about from taking a drug,
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.200]   well, those changes don't actually do a whole lot
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.100]   unless those circuits are reinforced
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.300]   by particular behaviors.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.040]   So this relates back to what I said just a few minutes ago
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:04.180]   about pro-depressive and anti-depressive behaviors.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.560]   Somebody can take ketamine
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.440]   and potentially get relief from depression,
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.120]   but if they continue to engage in pro-depressive behaviors,
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.480]   they are not going to get much,
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.240]   if any, relief from depression.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.640]   Conversely, if somebody takes ketamine
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.820]   and they are reducing the amount of output
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.520]   from this disappointment circuit, this habenula,
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.760]   to the reward circuitry of the brain,
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.280]   and they do engage in behaviors
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.860]   such as seeking out work that stimulates them,
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.760]   seeking out social engagement,
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.600]   taking good care of their body, their mental health,
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.240]   their physical health, et cetera,
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.720]   well, those circuits are not designed to respond to ketamine.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.080]   They are designed to respond
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.680]   to particular patterns of thinking and behavior.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.000]   So again, we can't forget that when we hear
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.320]   that a drug causes plasticity in a given neural circuit,
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.560]   what it's doing is it's biasing the balance
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.800]   or the probability that those neural circuits
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.000]   will be engaged by certain activities,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   but one still has to engage in those activities.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.300]   Now, fortunately, when people tend to have elevations
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.280]   in mood, they tend to move around more.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.000]   When they tend to move around more,
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.500]   they tend to engage in more things.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.720]   When they tend to engage in more things,
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.480]   if they have a positive outlook on life,
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.160]   presumably they are engaging in adaptive things,
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.120]   things like social relationships, job-related,
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.600]   school-related, goal-related behavior.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.480]   So it's important to understand that a discussion
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.060]   of neural circuit changes in response to ketamine
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.760]   is really a discussion of neural circuit changes
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.540]   in response to ketamine that shift one's overall system
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.140]   toward having yet further neural circuit changes
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.840]   in response to daily activities
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.720]   and thereby bolstering health,
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.440]   or in this case, mental health.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.840]   Now, it's also important to understand that rarely, if ever,
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.580]   does a drug provide relief
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.680]   for some sort of clinical challenge
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.680]   in just a one-track kind of way.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.240]   The way to think about this is that most mental processes
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.160]   and certainly things like depression are a two-way road.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.360]   You have pro-depressive behaviors in circuits
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.400]   and you have anti-depressive behaviors in circuits.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.340]   And so perhaps it won't be surprising to you
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.540]   that there's evidence that ketamine treatment
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.360]   can reduce the output from the habenula
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.280]   to the reward pathway,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.680]   this disappointment to reward pathway, weakening that,
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.680]   making the reward pathway more available for engagement
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.680]   through thoughts and behaviors that are anti-depressive.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.520]   And in addition to that,
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.340]   it can further bolster the neuroplasticity
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.720]   within the reward pathway itself,
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.360]   in particular with connections with the frontal cortex.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.800]   And for those of you that aren't familiar
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.980]   with the frontal cortex,
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.740]   your frontal cortex does a lot of things,
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.400]   but one of the things that your frontal cortex
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.300]   is absolutely critical for
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:32.880]   is for establishing context-dependent strategy,
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.020]   meaning for allowing you to say,
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.540]   okay, in a given circumstance,
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.960]   what should I do to get the results I want?
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.140]   In another circumstance,
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.880]   what should I do to get the results I want?
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.660]   It's not strategizing of the manipulative type,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.040]   although I suppose it could be,
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.760]   it's strategizing of how do I get what I need
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.300]   from this social connection?
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.100]   How do I get what I need from my goals in exercise?
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.200]   How do I get what I need from my goals
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.940]   in terms of work or school, et cetera?
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.000]   Your frontal cortex is that part of your cortex
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.440]   that's always churning ideas.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.880]   It's always wondering, am I doing well?
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.720]   Am I not doing well?
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.120]   And is adjusting your behavior accordingly.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.220]   So it's now established
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.120]   that ketamine can improve connectivity.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.200]   That is, it can strengthen the connections
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.140]   between areas of the brain that are associated
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.760]   with context-dependent strategy building
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.160]   and these reward pathways.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.680]   In other words, it makes people more sensitive
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.800]   to whether or not they are getting the results they want
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.080]   from their efforts and to how to adjust their efforts
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.240]   so that they do get the results they want from those efforts.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.220]   And there's other evidence
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:33.100]   that NMDA receptor blockade is not the way
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.420]   that ketamine provides relief from depression.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:38.060]   Namely, there's a drug called memantine.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.800]   It's used actually to treat Alzheimer's
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.140]   and it too is an NMDA receptor blocker
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.740]   and it has no antidepressant effects.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.700]   Now, as you recall, ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:50.060]   And one of its primary effects
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.700]   is to create this feeling of dissociation.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.980]   For those of you that aren't familiar
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.460]   with what dissociation is,
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:59.120]   dissociation is where people feel separate from their body.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.600]   They can still think,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.140]   but it's as if they are observing themselves.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.260]   In fact, in anticipation for this episode,
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.160]   I consulted with several different colleagues
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.300]   in the Department of Psychiatry
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.660]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.740]   And one of them described the effects of ketamine
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.260]   as described by a patient of theirs
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.980]   who had taken ketamine for the treatment of depression.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:20.080]   And that patient described it as observing themselves,
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.960]   thinking, observing themselves, doing things,
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.220]   even though they were lying completely still.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.020]   And perhaps most importantly,
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:29.460]   describing themselves as being above their body
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.380]   and actually looking down on themselves
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.820]   from the third person perspective.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.500]   Now that I realize is a foreign experience to most people,
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.640]   but of course there are people who experience dissociation
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.140]   even while not on ketamine.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.940]   And as many of you know,
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.240]   dissociation is actually one of the primary symptoms
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.260]   of PTSD and trauma.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:48.060]   So this raises a sort of conundrum.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.540]   Why is it that a particular state of mind
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.700]   that's associated with PTSD and trauma,
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.220]   and in some cases depression itself,
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.520]   which is induced by a drug like ketamine,
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.820]   can provide relief from depression?
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.880]   And that all goes back to the neuroplastic changes
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.280]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.220]   and more likely the changes in the mu-opioid receptor system
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.520]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.880]   But nonetheless, the dissociative effects of ketamine
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.180]   are so profound for people that take them
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.620]   that I thought I'd spend a minute or two
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.560]   explaining what likely causes
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.620]   that dissociative third-personing of self-effect.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.760]   And in so far as we know,
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.560]   it has to do with an uncoupling of certain brain circuits,
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.680]   in particular, neocortical brain circuits.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.100]   The neocortex is the part of the brain,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.940]   the lumpy outside part of the brain
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.720]   that's associated with action planning.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.020]   It does a lot of things, really.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.640]   It's involved in sensory perception.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.400]   It's involved in speech generation, many, many things.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.880]   But the neocortex has connections to other regions
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.080]   which are called subcortical regions.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.380]   And it seems that when people take ketamine
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.980]   or phencyclidine PCP,
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.780]   there's an uncoupling of those networks,
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.700]   a quieting of those networks
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.160]   that starts to create a different dominant rhythm
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.280]   in the brain.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.760]   Some of you may be familiar with rhythms in the brain,
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.320]   so-called alpha rhythms or alpha patterns of activity.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.500]   That's just dominant patterns of activity
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.540]   associated with particular brain states.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.940]   So for instance, alpha brain waves are associated
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.640]   with an alert but calm, relaxed state of mind
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.420]   where thoughts are sort of free flowing.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:14.940]   It's a little bit dreamlike,
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.060]   but it isn't really like a dream where anything can happen.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.800]   It has a structure to it.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.940]   When people take ketamine,
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:23.700]   the alpha pattern of activity is completely abolished,
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:24.840]   at least for the duration of time
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.300]   that they're under the influence of the drug,
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.500]   which typically is about an hour to two hours or so.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.340]   And a different pattern of brain activity,
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.780]   which is called the theta pattern of brain activity,
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.380]   starts to really emerge.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.100]   It's as if it gets unveiled.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.720]   And that theta pattern of activity
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.460]   is the one that's associated with a dreamlike state.
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.500]   It's the one that resides more or less at that liminal border
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.980]   between wakefulness and sleep.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.700]   If you've ever been falling asleep
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.300]   and you were thinking something like you were running
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.500]   and you kicked your leg,
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.220]   it's very likely that you were in theta pattern of activity
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.260]   in your brain at that moment,
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.020]   just prior to when you woke up.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.200]   Whereas when you're more alert,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.720]   you see patterns of activity that are higher frequency,
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.580]   things like alpha, beta rhythms, and so forth.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.260]   So ketamine produces particular patterns of brain activity
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.220]   and this sense of dissociation
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:12.380]   when it's taken at subanesthetic doses.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.880]   If you recall the clinical studies we talked about earlier,
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.540]   they injected half a milligram per kilogram of body weight
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.820]   in order to provide depression relief for those patients.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.420]   When people take ketamine,
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.740]   they will take it by different routes of delivery.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.860]   And now here we have to expand our conversation
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.180]   to include both the clinical context,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.540]   research studies and recreational use.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.900]   Now I do that because typically when people take ketamine
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.940]   in a study, in a clinical study,
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.420]   they will get an intravenous into the vein
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.140]   or an intramuscular into the muscle injection
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:48.060]   of half a milligram per kilogram of body weight ketamine.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.180]   However, when people are taking ketamine recreationally
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.640]   or when they are accessing ketamine legally by prescription
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.820]   and taking it at home,
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.280]   which is becoming a more common practice,
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.860]   they will often take it orally in pill form
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.760]   or they will take it sublingually
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.740]   by putting it under the tongue or in their cheek.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.460]   And then that so-called troche dissolves
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.620]   and the ketamine goes into their system.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.460]   Now, an important thing to understand is that
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.500]   when people take ketamine orally,
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.620]   only 25% of the active form of ketamine
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.420]   makes it into the bloodstream.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.740]   And when they take it sublingually,
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.140]   typically only about 35% of the total amount of ketamine
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.140]   they take is converted into metabolically active ketamine
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.580]   that acts on the neurons in their brain.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.100]   So when you hear about the dosages used in studies,
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.140]   they are going to generally involve injections of ketamine
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.940]   and far lower doses of ketamine
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.440]   than when you hear about people taking ketamine orally
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.660]   or sublingually.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:43.160]   So for instance, I weigh 220 pounds, that's 100 kilograms.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.940]   So if I were to be in one of these studies,
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.500]   which I have not been, but if I were,
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.340]   I would be given 50 milligrams of ketamine
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.580]   by way of injection.
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.060]   However, if I were going to try to achieve
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.780]   the same amount of active ketamine
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:59.700]   in my bloodstream and brain as I would through injection,
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.440]   I would need to ingest three times as much ketamine
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.460]   by way of pill and perhaps a little bit more
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.500]   by way of sublingual ketamine
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.380]   if I wanted to get the same effects.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.500]   So if I were to take 50 milligrams
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.420]   by way of injection in a study
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:16.280]   and I went to a different study and they said,
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.520]   "Okay, we want to recreate that effect.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.620]   We're going to give you a pill."
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:22.540]   Typically, they're going to give me 150 milligrams
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.620]   of ketamine in a pill form
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:29.100]   or 200 milligrams of ketamine in the troche sublingual form.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.780]   Now, it's really important to understand this dose dependence
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.700]   according to delivery business,
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.640]   because I realized that nowadays, especially,
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.540]   a lot of people are taking ketamine through legal sources.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.260]   So they're accessing it legally,
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.960]   but they're taking it outside the clinic
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.140]   and more typically, they're taking it
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.740]   not by way of injection,
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.660]   meaning they're taking higher dose ketamine
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.360]   and they're taking it sublingually or orally.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.220]   So it's very important to understand this dose dependence
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:56.620]   according to mode of delivery business.
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.260]   Now, in anticipation of this episode,
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.280]   I put out a request for questions about ketamine on Twitter
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.700]   and I got many, many questions,
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.580]   some excellent ones therein.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.660]   But one of the more common questions was,
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.980]   what is a K-hole in scientific terms?
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.160]   A K-hole is what's used to describe
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.580]   the subjective experience of when somebody takes ketamine,
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.100]   typically recreationally,
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.780]   and they end up in basically a pseudoanesthetized state.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:27.820]   What that means is that they took a dosage that for them,
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.420]   put them beyond the boundary of the subanesthetic dose
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.660]   and has them transitioning
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:36.900]   into the anesthesia level dose of ketamine.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.060]   Now, I mentioned everything I did about dosages before
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:43.460]   because it's very important to know that different people,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.100]   even if they are of equivalent body weight,
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.380]   are going to respond to ketamine differently
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.900]   depending on how quickly
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.760]   and how thoroughly they metabolize ketamine.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.900]   So in the clinical context,
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:59.260]   injections of ketamine into the vein or into the muscle
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:02.720]   are done at this half a milligram per kilogram dose.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:03.760]   And they have clinicians there,
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.500]   they have researchers there who are paying attention
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.560]   to whether or not the person is in a dissociative state
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.160]   if they're still conscious,
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.340]   and to see whether or not the person
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.640]   is going into full-blown anesthesia.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.460]   Now, that's one of the values of doing ketamine
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.920]   in the context of a legal clinical setting.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.160]   However, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.640]   that a lot of people are getting ketamine legally,
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.640]   but then taking it at home, hopefully not alone.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.780]   Hopefully there's someone there to monitor them
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.920]   where they're in session with their physician over Zoom.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.620]   That's actually happening more and more these days
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.940]   through telehealth.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:35.940]   But that itself also has certain risks, right?
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.960]   Because if the person needs something
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.000]   and they don't have someone there immediately in the room
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:40.960]   to take care of it,
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.960]   that could be a very problematic situation.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.620]   And of course, there are situations
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.280]   where people are taking ketamine recreationally.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.820]   Regardless of how they're acquiring it,
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.760]   they're taking it and they are guessing
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.360]   how they're going to respond to it
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.180]   based on some crude understanding of dosages.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.800]   But when people talk about a K-hole,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.000]   what they're talking about is taking ketamine at a dose
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.960]   that for them takes them beyond the mild
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.880]   or perhaps even an extreme dissociation
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.760]   and starts placing them into full-blown anesthesia.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.920]   And that itself actually can be dangerous.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.620]   Going into anesthesia like planes of consciousness,
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.320]   while not always deadly, can be deadly.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.720]   And it certainly can be and has been deadly
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.240]   when people start to combine it with other drugs,
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.360]   in particular drugs like barbiturates or alcohol.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.080]   So I want to be very clear that the dosage ranges
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.240]   that you hear about when hearing about ketamine
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.640]   are extremely broad.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.820]   And so is the variability to any one given dose.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:38.820]   And so too is the response to a given dose in a given person,
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.340]   depending on the route of delivery.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.440]   You need to be very careful about the ability of ketamine
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.860]   to take you into deep, deep planes of unconsciousness
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:50.060]   and in some cases, death.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.240]   And of course, as with any sedative,
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.880]   one needs to be extremely cautious about doing anything
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.080]   like driving or even walking in traffic
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.380]   or walking anywhere in some cases,
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.660]   if one is under the influence of ketamine.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:05.660]   Additionally, for those of you that are seizure-prone,
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.920]   either due to epilepsy or prior head injury,
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.460]   or maybe you're seizure-prone and you don't know it,
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.840]   ketamine can induce seizures
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.000]   and it should be completely obvious to you now
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.440]   why that's the case.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.300]   Ketamine blocks NMDA receptors on inhibitory neurons
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.700]   and quiets their activity,
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.200]   which of course can lead to runaway excitation in the brain
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.720]   if you are seizure-prone.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.360]   When I put out the request for questions
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.880]   about ketamine on social media,
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.520]   I also got a lot of questions
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.760]   about the different forms of ketamine.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.800]   When I say different forms that included questions
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.840]   about whether or not intranasal was better than oral,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.980]   was better than sublingual, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:41.780]   To be fair, with one exception,
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.720]   the different modes of delivery probably relate more
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.200]   to dosage that actually gets metabolized
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.020]   than to anything else.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.720]   What I mean by that is most people don't know
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.760]   how to equate the clinical dose
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.600]   of half a milligram per kilogram of body weight
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.660]   into a dosage to take orally or sublingually,
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.480]   or in some cases, by the way, people will take it rectally.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.680]   And the reason people take ketamine rectally
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.280]   is that rectal administration bypasses the liver,
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.120]   and indeed ketamine can be hard on the liver to metabolize.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.760]   It can dramatically increase liver enzymes.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.440]   So oftentimes people that are taking ketamine frequently
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.040]   and don't want to create damage to the liver,
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.440]   they will opt for a rectal administration.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.520]   Now, I realize that unless it's somehow related
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.340]   to your profession,
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.320]   anytime somebody says intra rectally,
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.600]   it raises a few eyebrows
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:30.200]   and people kind of lean back a little bit, and I get it.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.720]   In a future episode of the podcast,
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.080]   I promise to distinguish
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.360]   between the different modes of drug metabolism,
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.060]   depending on whether or not people take something orally,
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:41.760]   sublingually, by injection, or rectally.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.080]   Another common question I got
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.360]   when I solicited for questions about ketamine
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.280]   on social media was about the R versus S
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.720]   versus RS forms of ketamine.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.880]   And I must tell you that sent me down
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.000]   a deep, deep rabbit hole of research
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.400]   in which I discovered very contradictory evidence.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.440]   For instance, I could find papers,
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.960]   I did find papers that said that the R form of ketamine
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.360]   had a much greater affinity for the NMDA receptor
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.820]   than did the S form of ketamine.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:15.520]   I also found reviews that said the exact opposite, okay?
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.300]   And there I was sitting with the two reviews
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.140]   in front of one another,
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:21.600]   wondering if there was something wrong with my visual system
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.880]   until I called a colleague, Dr. Nolan Williams,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.480]   who's a triple board certified neurologist psychiatrist
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.160]   whose laboratory specializes in the use of ketamine
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.700]   for studies of treating depression
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:36.300]   and for treating depression in the clinical population.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.040]   So I asked him, what's the deal here?
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.920]   I'm getting very contradictory evidence,
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.680]   and he spelled it all out for me.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.920]   It appears, based on the clinical data in humans
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.640]   and on binding studies,
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.520]   that the S form of ketamine is more potent.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.440]   That is, it can more robustly bind to the NMDA receptor.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.480]   And in addition to that, the S form of ketamine
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   tends to produce less dissociation at a given dosage
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.480]   than does the combined SR form of ketamine or pure R ketamine.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.560]   He also added, and sent me a study
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.400]   that I'll link in the show note captions,
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.040]   that there was recently a clinical trial of R ketamine,
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.520]   so pure R ketamine alone,
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.900]   and it failed to relieve depressive symptoms.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.460]   So I said, great, thank you so much.
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:26.940]   This is now all made very clear to me
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.180]   that S ketamine is the preferred form,
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.100]   it produces less dissociation,
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.780]   and it provides better depression relief.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.300]   And then he said, no, actually,
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.860]   it's a little more complicated than that.
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.380]   It appears the situation is the following.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:44.160]   The combined SR form of ketamine
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.040]   seems to be the most potent
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.300]   for relieving depressive symptoms.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:53.100]   The S form of ketamine is second best
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.680]   in terms of providing relief from depressive symptoms,
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.000]   and is the one that's most commonly prescribed nowadays
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.680]   by nasal spray, by oral dosing, by sublingual dosing,
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.380]   and it's what is typically given by way of injection
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.320]   in clinical studies where they do injections.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.680]   And it appears that the R form of ketamine
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.300]   is the least potent and effective in treating depression.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.780]   Now, I realize that by putting this out
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.320]   into the larger world,
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.360]   and assuming that there are experts in ketamine out there,
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.720]   either by way of use or by clinical study of their own,
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.360]   that I will get a lot of comments back saying,
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.640]   no, actually the R form was more effective for me
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.100]   than the S form versus the SR form, et cetera.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.280]   Just to reiterate from the clinical trials
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.120]   that have been done,
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.100]   we know that the combined SR form
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.200]   is more potent and effective than the pure S form,
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.580]   which is still more effective than the pure R form.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.640]   So that's what we know now based on the clinical studies.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:48.060]   But of course, I acknowledge that anytime a drug is out there
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.620]   as a clinical tool and it's being used recreationally,
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.920]   that people are going to explore
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.060]   and they're going to experiment
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.840]   and they're going to find what works best for them.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.240]   So I certainly invite feedback
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.300]   about what has worked best for you,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.780]   hopefully in the clinical context.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.140]   So whether or not people have used ketamine prescription
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:03.980]   from their doctor,
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.060]   whether or not they participated in a clinical study
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.780]   or whether or not they're doing it recreationally,
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:10.040]   I imagine that I will hear about those experiences
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.520]   and I will take note of them.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.960]   Another commonly asked question I received was,
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.940]   what about microdosing of ketamine?
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.920]   And there's a lot of interest in microdosing nowadays.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.440]   People are microdosing psilocybin,
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.760]   people are microdosing all sorts of things,
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.720]   hoping to get some of the same effects as the macro doses,
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.220]   but by using dosages of compounds
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.060]   that are below what would induce say,
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.820]   in the case of psilocybin, hallucinations,
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.540]   or in the case of ketamine,
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:37.340]   below what would induce the kind of dissociation
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:40.140]   and euphoric effects that one would have to lie down
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:42.960]   for a few hours and disengage for the rest of the day.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.380]   I consulted with my clinician colleagues about this
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.240]   and they told me that at present, meaning as of yesterday,
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.160]   there is zero published clinical evidence
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.700]   that they are aware of, and by way of extension,
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:58.700]   that I am aware of, in which microdosing ketamine
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:01.040]   has been effective for the treatment of depression.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.660]   All of the positive effects on depression
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.800]   that I've talked about during this episode
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.060]   are gleaned from studies where people used
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:10.060]   this half milligram per kilogram dosage of ketamine
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.360]   or its equivalent by way of some other route
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.420]   of administration, not injected, but oral or sublingual.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.240]   So are there any benefits to microdosing ketamine
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.760]   as far as the scientific and clinical literature
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.840]   that's published as of today is concerned?
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.320]   The answer is no.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.820]   Okay, so today we covered a lot of information.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.080]   We talked about what ketamine is.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.200]   Remember, ketamine and PCP, angel dust,
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.880]   very similar compounds, both block the NMDA receptor.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.760]   We also talked about what sorts of subjective effects
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.960]   that produces, dissociation and mild euphoria
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.860]   and third-personing of self, that's the dissociation,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.300]   when taken at low dosages.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:48.660]   And when taken at higher dosages, it can induce
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.280]   full-blown anesthesia and put people
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.700]   into subconscious states.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:54.900]   And there's actually a potential even for seizure and death
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:58.280]   if the dosage is high enough for that person.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.280]   Again, I want to emphasize that people's dosage sensitivity
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.100]   varies tremendously, route of delivery will impact that,
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.100]   and on and on.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.460]   We also talked about how the NMDA receptor itself
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.040]   and the activation of this incredible molecule, BDNF,
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.300]   brain-derived neutrophic factor, seem to be important
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.260]   for at least some of the antidepressant effects of ketamine,
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.220]   both in the days and weeks
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.360]   following ketamine administration.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.960]   And in addition to that, I described how ketamine impacts
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.360]   the opioid receptor system and how we simply cannot overlook
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.960]   the involvement of the opioid receptor system
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.420]   in producing the antidepressant effects of ketamine.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.320]   And we also talked about the brain circuits
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.840]   and the brain waves associated with dissociative states
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.680]   and the depression relief that seems to arrive
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.400]   for many people who take ketamine.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.260]   And I tried to highlight some of the unique features
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:45.100]   of ketamine.
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:48.020]   First of all, that it does seem to provide depression relief
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.160]   where other approaches have not,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.020]   but that the depression relief tends to be pretty short-lived
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.300]   unless it's applied in this multi-times per week
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.460]   over multiple weeks kind of fashion
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.540]   to produce what I call durable changes,
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:03.980]   which almost certainly involve changes in neuroplasticity,
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.180]   that is rewiring of brain circuits.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.180]   And another key point that I highlighted
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.440]   is that we always have to remember
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.760]   that when thinking about how chemicals like ketamine
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.640]   or any other substance for that matter
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.880]   can modify brain circuits in order to change them
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.860]   and provide relief from depression
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:22.000]   or some other psychiatric challenge,
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.540]   that always, always, always there is a requirement
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.320]   for engaging in antidepressant behaviors
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.060]   as a way to further reinforce whatever positive changes
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.940]   have come about through the drug treatment.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.240]   As a friend and colleague of mine
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.340]   who's expert in this area once so aptly said,
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:38.840]   "Better living through chemistry
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.900]   still requires better living."
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:42.700]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.900]   about ketamine.

[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.000]   Not on today's podcast,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.340]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.360]   we discussed supplements.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.420]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:22.360]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.800]   for things like sleep support, hormone support,
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.280]   and improving focus.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.320]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.960]   has partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.560]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.380]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.200]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.160]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:45.300]   So Instagram, Twitter, Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:46.560]   And on all of those platforms,
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.280]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.720]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.840]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.940]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.000]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.160]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.260]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:41:59.480]   to our neural network newsletter,
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.320]   our neural network newsletter is a free monthly newsletter
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.560]   that includes podcast summaries and protocols
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.560]   in the form of brief one to three page PDFs.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.480]   Those protocols include things like a toolkit
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.160]   to enhance the quality and duration of your sleep,
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.400]   toolkits to improve learning and neuroplasticity,
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.120]   toolkits for deliberate cold exposure,
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.040]   exercise, focus, dopamine, and on and on.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.600]   To sign up for the neural network newsletter,
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.240]   you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.400]   go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.580]   You sign up using your email,
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.880]   but I want to emphasize that we do not share your email
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.040]   with anybody.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.560]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.680]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.480]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:40.640]   (upbeat music)
