[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   So I work on a detector called LHCb, which is one of these four big detectors that are
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.360]   spaced around the ring. We do slightly different stuff to the big guys. There's two big experiments
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.680]   called ATLAS and CMS, 3,000 physicists and scientists and computer scientists on them
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.200]   each. They are the ones that discovered the Higgs and they look for supersymmetry in dark
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.360]   matter and so on. What we look at are standard model particles called bquarks, which depending
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.320]   on your preferences, either bottom or beauty. We tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.360]   But these particles are interesting because we can make lots of them. We make billions
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800]   or hundreds of billions of these things. You can therefore measure their properties very
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.060]   precisely. So you can make these really lovely precision measurements. And what we are doing
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.840]   really is a sort of complementary thing to the other big experiments, which is, if you
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680]   think of the analogy that I often use is, if you imagine you're in the jungle and you're
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.280]   looking for an elephant, say, and you are a hunter. Let's say the elephant is very rare,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.520]   you don't know where in the jungle, the jungle is big. So there's two ways you go about this.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.200]   Either you can go wandering around the jungle and try and find the elephant. The problem
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.440]   is if there's only one elephant and the jungle is big, the chances of running into it are
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.840]   very small. Or you could look on the ground and see if you see footprints left by the
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.720]   elephant. And if the elephant's moving around, you've got a chance, you've got a better chance
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.200]   maybe of seeing the elephant's footprints. If you see the footprints, you go, "Okay,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   there's an elephant. I maybe don't know what kind of elephant it is, but I got a sense
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.920]   there's something out there." So that's sort of what we do. We are the footprint people.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.520]   We're looking for the footprints, the impressions that quantum fields that we haven't managed
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.240]   to directly create the particle of, the effects these quantum fields have on the ordinary
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.980]   standard model fields that we already know about. So these B particles, the way they
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.720]   behave can be influenced by the presence of say super fields or dark matter fields or
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.600]   whatever you like. And the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly from what
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.280]   our theory tells us they ought to behave.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   - Gotcha. And it's easier to collect huge amounts of data on B quarks.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.400]   - We get billions and billions of these things. You can make very precise measurements. And
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   the only place really at the LHC or in really in high energy physics at the moment where
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.640]   there's fairly compelling evidence that there might be something beyond the standard model
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.200]   is in these B, these beauty quarks decays.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.520]   - Just to clarify, what is the difference between the four experiments, for example,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.160]   that you mentioned? Is it the kind of particles that are being collided? Is it the energies
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.220]   at which they're collided? What's the fundamental difference between the different experiments?
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.720]   - The collisions are the same. What's different is the design of the detectors. So Atlas and
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.160]   CMS are called, they're called what are called general purpose detectors. And they are basically
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   barrel shaped machines and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel and the
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.320]   barrel captures all the particles that go flying out in every direction. So in a sphere
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   effectively that can fly out and it can record all of those particles.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.800]   - And what's the, sorry to be interrupting, but what's the mechanism of the recording?
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.500]   - Oh, so these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them, they're huge. Like Atlas is 25 meters
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.420]   high and 45 meters long. They're vast machines, instruments I guess you should call them really.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.340]   They are, they're kind of like onions. So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.460]   different sorts of detectors. So close into the beam pipe, you have what are called usually
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.300]   made of silicon, they're tracking detectors. So they're little, made of strips of silicon
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.940]   or pixels of silicon. And when a particle goes through the silicon, it gives a little
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.700]   electrical signal and you get these dots, you know, electrical dots through your detector,
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.500]   which allows you to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle. So that's the middle. And
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.740]   then the outsides of these detectors, you have things called calorimeters, which measure
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.380]   the energies of the particles. And then very edge, you have things called muon chambers,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.420]   which basically met these muon particles, which are the heavy version of the electron.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.620]   They are, they're like high velocity bullets and they can get right to the edge of the
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.580]   detectors. If you see something at the edge, that's a muon. So that's broadly how they
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580]   work.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.580]   And all of that is being recorded.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.580]   That's all being fed out to, you know, computers.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.020]   That data must be awesome. Okay.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.140]   So LHCb is different. So we, because we're looking for these be quarks, be quarks tend
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.540]   to be produced along the beam line. So in a collision, the be quarks tend to fly sort
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.220]   of close to the beam pipe. So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped basically,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.780]   that just looks in one direction. So we ignore, if you have your collision stuff goes everywhere.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.500]   We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways. We're just looking in this little
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   region close to the beam pipe where most of these be quarks are made.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.300]   So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved in the collection of the be quark?
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.180]   Yeah, there are some differences. So one of the differences is that one of the ways, you
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.180]   know, you've seen a be quark is that be quarks are actually quite long lived by particle
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.420]   standards. So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second, which is if you're, if you're
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.540]   a fundamental particle is a very long time. Cause you know, the Higgs boson, I think lives
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.460]   for about a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, or maybe even less than that. So
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.540]   these are quite long lived things and they will actually fly a little distance before
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.220]   they decay. So they will fly, you know, a few centimeters, maybe if you're lucky, then
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.180]   they'll decay into other stuff. So what we need to do in the middle of the detector,
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.420]   you want to be able to see you have your place where the protons crash into each other and
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.980]   that produces loads of particles that come flying out. So you have loads of lines, loads
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.700]   of tracks that point back to that proton collision. And then you're looking for a couple of other
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.740]   tracks, maybe two or three that point back to a different place. That's maybe a few centimeters
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.260]   away from the proton collision. And that's the sign that a little be particle has flown
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.540]   a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else. So we need to be able to very accurately resolve
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.980]   the proton collision from the be particle decay. So we are, the middle of our detector
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.780]   is very sensitive and it gets very close to the collision. So you have this really beautiful,
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.260]   delicate silicon detector that sits, I think it's seven mil millimeters from the beam.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.180]   And the LHC beam has as much energy as a jumbo jet at takeoff. So it's enough to melt a ton
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.660]   of copper. So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next to this tiny, delicate,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:21.260]   you know, silicon sensor. So those aspects of our detector that are specialized to measure
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.820]   these particular be quarks that we're interested in.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.300]   - And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere that there's some mention of matter
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.220]   and antimatter connected to the be, these beautiful quarks. Is that, what's the connection?
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.380]   Yeah, what's the connection there?
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.980]   - Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that when you produce these be particles,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.580]   these particles, because you don't see the be quark, you see the thing that be quark
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.420]   is inside. So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles, where the be quark
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.180]   is joined together with another quark or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.380]   it is. There are a particular set of these be particles that exhibit this property called
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.820]   oscillation. So if you make a, for the sake of argument, a matter version of one of these
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.820]   be particles, as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics, it oscillates
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.380]   backwards and forwards between its matter and antimatter versions. So it does this weird
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.940]   flipping about backwards and forwards. And what we can use this for is a laboratory for
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.500]   testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter. So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.980]   it's exact, then we should see these be particles decaying as often as matter as they do as
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.580]   antimatter because this oscillation should be even. It should spend as much time in each
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.060]   state. But what we actually see is that one of the states it spends more time in, it's
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.820]   more likely to decay in one state than the other. So this gives us a way of testing this
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.940]   fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.440]   [END]
