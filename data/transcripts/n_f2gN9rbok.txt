[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   There's three key things about sleep
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.820]   that relate to metabolic health.
[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.420]   It's that we want to get good quantity of sleep,
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.100]   good quality of sleep, and good consistency of sleep.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.240]   All three of those factors independently
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.220]   are related to our metabolic health.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.980]   Some people may not be feeling their best
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.960]   or doing great with their metabolic health,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.800]   and they're like,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.920]   "But I get seven or eight hours of sleep a night,"
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.520]   so we need to dial in some of the other factors too.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.840]   So when I talk about sleep quantity,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.800]   the sweet spot for metabolic health
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.480]   seems to be about seven to eight hours of good quality sleep
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.320]   per night.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.680]   It's variable for different people.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.160]   This is why wearables like Oura rings are great.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640]   For quality, this is about uninterrupted sleep.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   So we know that people who have more interruptions
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.600]   in their sleep have a much higher risk
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.520]   for metabolic disease.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.680]   So this is like anything that's a distraction
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.840]   or interruption in the room or light in the room
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.160]   can impair quality of sleep,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.380]   and that impacts metabolic health.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.380]   If there's interruptions, that happens,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.440]   but we can do the best we can.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.320]   And then for consistency,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.000]   we're talking about basically going to bed
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.400]   at a regular time and getting up at a regular time.
