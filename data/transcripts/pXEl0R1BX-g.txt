[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Zakaria asks, "Dr. Lex, I'm a high school student in Libya.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   I am very interested in new technology
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   and artificial intelligence,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.240]   and I've taken the online course CS50x from Harvard.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.560]   What do you advise people like me to learn?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.680]   I'm at a disadvantage
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.240]   because of my country's educational system.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000]   I one day want to become a great engineer like you,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Elon Musk, and many more that may not be as famous.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900]   I'm very grateful for the mere chance
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.480]   of you replying to this.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.280]   What a world we're in,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.120]   that a kid from nowhere can be asking questions
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.520]   of an MIT researcher."
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   Zakaria, thank you very much for the question.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   You're too kind.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.680]   I probably have a lot to say about this topic,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.400]   but let me try to be brief and to the point.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.340]   I think it's wonderful that you reached out
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.760]   and that you have a clarity to your passion.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.080]   Don't lose track of that in your college years
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.320]   and the years to come.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.000]   Don't forget that you have an interest
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.360]   in artificial intelligence.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.340]   Don't forget that that fire was there
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.380]   when you were in high school and keep that fire burning.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.060]   I think the question you've asked is about the disadvantage.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.440]   I think we live in a world where there's a lot of injustice,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.900]   where we don't all start from the same place.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.340]   And that disadvantage doesn't always look
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.700]   the same for everyone.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.260]   And how to make a more just world is,
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.540]   in many ways, what we're struggling as a society
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.660]   to understand now, but that's a much bigger topic
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.960]   than either you or I.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.380]   I think what you should be focused on
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.020]   is what you can do for your life.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.780]   Your circumstance is your circumstance.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.660]   I've always believed that my disadvantages
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.580]   are my superpowers.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.340]   And I think your disadvantage is your superpower.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.580]   Use it as fuel.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.940]   If you look at stories of great men,
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.900]   of great women in history,
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.420]   that story always has a lot of disadvantages
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.520]   that were overcome.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.300]   There is something in the process of overcoming hardship
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.020]   that creates greatness.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.120]   Most people quit through that process.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   If you can survive it, then your story will be a great one.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.660]   So the education system in Libya may not be optimal
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.020]   for your passion of artificial intelligence.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.660]   Perhaps you want to become a professor
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.140]   or a top researcher in the world.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.300]   It's difficult to go from Libya
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.820]   to one of the best universities in America, for example.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.620]   But it's not impossible.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160]   And once again, the story of great people
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.620]   starts very much like your own story.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.940]   So practically speaking, what does that mean?
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.740]   I would take your education online.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.340]   And not only to study, but to build stuff.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.060]   I think the best way you can overcome
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.200]   the physical constraints of your upbringing
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.020]   is by using the internet to build stuff
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.500]   and show it to the world.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   Build it, complete it, and show it to the world.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.420]   So that means learning how to program.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.740]   That means building something
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.220]   that you're really excited about and something that's new.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.900]   And the best, if it's something that's new
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.140]   and a bunch of people use and it brings them joy
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.780]   or it brings them value,
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.700]   just even the smallest possible thing.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.840]   So that might start at first by reimplementing things
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.500]   that other people have done.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.620]   But then finding something that you're curious about,
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.060]   something that kind of gives you a little spark of joy,
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.820]   imagining that you might be able to figure out that puzzle.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.340]   Don't lose track of that joy.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.420]   Like the moment you detect that this might be something
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.960]   that you might be excited about
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.300]   or you already are excited about, hold onto that.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.900]   Hold onto that fire and go with it.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.320]   Because there's going to be dark periods of time
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.420]   when you lose hope,
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.140]   when you're not so interested in that thing.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.380]   Keep going.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.140]   And remember that that fire was there.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.360]   And the thing is, at least for me,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.100]   I think when there's a passion,
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.780]   it can wane, it can go up and down, but it always returns.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.180]   So once you have a passion, take those early few steps,
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.340]   which are always the hardest, and then just keep going.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.340]   Just keep going one step at a time,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.280]   keep grinding it out and believe it's gonna work out.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.700]   So one of the most important thing is to finish,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.180]   to finish building something cool.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.200]   Not too ambitious, something small, something cool,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.500]   something hopefully new.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.060]   And then show it off to people, show it off to me,
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.780]   and I'll share it with the world.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.900]   It might not be me, it might be others.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.780]   And just putting yourself out there in the world,
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.320]   and you never know what might happen.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.080]   I think in many ways I feel highly undeserving
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.740]   of the things I've gotten.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.840]   I have worked extremely hard,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.620]   but I feel that there's a lot of people that also work hard
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.140]   and are better than me at a lot of the things that I do.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.500]   So I've been just really fortunate.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   But I've also seen the magic of just being kind to people,
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.260]   working hard, and putting things you love out there.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.260]   And the beauty of the internet, as it is,
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.500]   is that when you put stuff you love out there,
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.220]   something good will happen, something magical will happen.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.120]   It might not be the kind of success you imagine,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.980]   but it will be a kind of success
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.500]   that'll be really fulfilling if you hear it,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.140]   if you allow your sort of, if you open your heart to it.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.140]   So like, don't be constrained at thinking that
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.860]   education, MIT, or Stanford is a definition of success.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.420]   Success might be your own business.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.740]   Success might be working for a small startup
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.180]   that brings you joy.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.420]   Success might be using your software engineering skills
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.420]   in your 20s to help out a farmer in agriculture,
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.660]   or a lawyer in a legal profession,
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.260]   or a doctor in medical.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.620]   Like, the journey might take you all kinds of places,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.560]   but as long as you allow yourself to be carried
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.080]   by your passion, you'll discover something magical.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.780]   Again, without jealousy, with honesty,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.260]   with hard work, with kindness,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.740]   just putting yourself out there,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.660]   I think magical things happen.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.780]   But let me tell you, once again,
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.820]   as you mentioned disadvantage,
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.220]   I think disadvantage on an individual level,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.460]   I believe you have to see it as a gift for yourself.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.800]   You have to see it as a superpower.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.140]   Because when your story is written,
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.620]   and I'm confident it will be written,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.380]   it'll be a great story, and chapter two and three
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.640]   will include a bunch of disadvantages,
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.460]   a bunch of hardships you have to overcome.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.220]   In fact, chapter four, five, and six will be hardship too.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.820]   It's only the later chapters you get
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.320]   to have a little bit more fun,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.340]   but really, I think overcoming hardship
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.060]   is kind of the fun part in life.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.060]   So call me crazy, but I would recommend
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.940]   not to listen to anybody who tells you to be safe,
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.580]   to find a stable job.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.900]   Listen to your heart, listen to your passion.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.460]   Take bold, big risks when you're young.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.880]   That is the time to do it.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.260]   Work hard, build stuff, put it on GitHub,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.260]   share it with the world, give joy and/or value to others.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.500]   And I think however this crazy world works
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.960]   with love and karma, it will repay you in the end.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   So good luck, I believe in you.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.740]   Can't wait to listen to the book about your life
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.700]   on audiobook when I run in my 80s.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.340]   So Zachariah, I'm cheering for you,
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.740]   and so is the rest of the world.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.860]   So good luck.
