[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Dr. Russell Moore is the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   He joins us again today filling in for John Piper.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.400]   Dr. Moore, as you know, the landscape of sexual ethics in America is changing rapidly, maybe
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.240]   faster than anyone could have expected.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.960]   You carefully studied the trends of our culture.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.360]   In your opinion, what do you expect in the near future?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.160]   Where is the American sex ethic headed?
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.040]   And what will be the fallout?
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.040]   I was with my grandmother one time, years and years ago, we ran into a woman in the
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   community where I grew up who had divorced her husband and she had moved in with a man
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.640]   that she wasn't married to.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.960]   My grandmother was very kind to her.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.120]   She was asking her, "How are you doing?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.600]   What's going on in your life?"
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.840]   And my grandmother said, "And how's your lover?"
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.920]   And I remember being taken aback.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.840]   And when the woman left, I said to my grandmother, "What did you just say?"
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.480]   And she said, "Well, isn't that what you call it, a lover?"
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.560]   And I said, "You know what?
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   Don't ever say lover again."
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960]   And it was this moment of skin crawling in my own life.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.320]   But I realized the reason that my grandmother was so awkwardly handling this is because
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.480]   she had never met anybody, I don't think, in real life who was in that situation.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.600]   She was living with somebody who wasn't her husband.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.160]   Well, we're moving into a time when that is going to become...there are going to be
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.320]   fewer and fewer things that are going to be shocking to people.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.880]   The problem is that we're moving into a time now where I think technology is going to change
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.480]   to some degree the nature of sexual temptation.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   It's not going to change sexual temptation itself.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320]   There's nothing new, as the Bible says, under the sun.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   Sin is what it is.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   Temptation is what it is.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.640]   But technology can change how that temptation comes to people.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   And so I expect, for instance, the nature of pornography to change.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.540]   And that has real implications for teaching within the church.
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.220]   Think about, for instance, what was going on a generation ago when people thought about
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.500]   porn, they were thinking about pressuring those outlets in their communities from providing
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   this.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.740]   And so your local 7-Eleven, your local convenience store had pornographic magazines behind the
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.020]   counter or that local video store had the area behind the curtain back there in the
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.120]   back of the room.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.100]   And there was a lot of effort given to pressure those businesses not to traffic in pornography
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.540]   or hotels from having pornographic movies and so forth.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.140]   And that was commendable and that was admirable.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.740]   But what no one saw at the time was that there was a digital revolution coming that would
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.680]   make pornography near ubiquitous, virtually ubiquitous, and also that it would bring with
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.220]   it this illusion of anonymity so that somebody doesn't have to think of himself or think
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.380]   of herself as the sort of person who would go and rent that videotape or go and purchase
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.060]   that magazine.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.500]   I think we need to be asking, how is technology moving and how is that going to change the
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.600]   nature of temptation?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.660]   I think it is quite possible that what we're going to be seeing is a kind of four-dimensional
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:50.260]   sort of reality for porn where there is a virtual reality created that can be indistinguishable
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.620]   from an actual sexual encounter.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.380]   There are already people talking about what's going to happen when there is, for instance,
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.780]   the use of lifelike robots, for instance, for sexual immorality and so forth.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780]   I think we need to be ready for that and to expect that.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.420]   I also think we need to expect the transgender issue to become more and more at the forefront
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.220]   as more and more people start to, especially children and young people, start to become
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.660]   confused about gender identity.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.860]   I just had to deal with, just last night, my own children, we were watching the news
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.060]   and there was a news program that came on about a young boy who was, I don't know, four
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.180]   or five years old and thought of himself as a girl and was going through the transition
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.180]   to be a girl.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.420]   My kid said, "I didn't even know that could happen, that a boy could turn into a girl."
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.680]   Well, parents are going to have to know how to answer that question because those sorts
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.220]   of things are going to happen more and more and more.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.280]   I think we can also expect marriage rates to continue to go down as marriage continues
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.580]   to become redefined and become so elastic.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.260]   I think the very meaning of marriage starts to change and marriage rates go down.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.900]   Who are those who suffer?
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.420]   Women, children, the poor, the most vulnerable are those who suffer right away.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.580]   And then I also think we need to recognize that while we're making a good deal of progress
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.540]   on the life issue as it relates to abortion, I worry about the way that the abortion issue
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.220]   is becoming less clinical and more chemical.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.180]   And so I worry about what's going to happen when, like pornography, abortion brings with
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:53.340]   it that illusion of anonymity where someone simply has to go and get a prescription from
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.260]   a local pharmacy in order to destroy this life within them.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.360]   I think that is something we're going to have to be watching and ready to address within
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.540]   our churches as well.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:14.100]   Short term, I think the sexual revolution is going to continue to ravage churches, communities,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.100]   neighborhoods.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.140]   But long term, I think the sexual revolution is going to leave a lot of people wanting.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.100]   It's not going to be able to carry through on its promises.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.660]   And so we need to be ready for those, like the woman at the well in Samaria, to be able
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.180]   to speak about not only what it is that they're doing wrong with a call to repentance, but
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.500]   also to say, "We have water that you know not of.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:51.460]   We have living water that actually satisfies," to be able to articulate better why we believe
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.980]   the things that we believe about marriage and sexuality, not only because they are moral,
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.140]   but because they're based and they're rooted in the gospel.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.480]   This picture of one man giving himself to one woman and one woman giving herself to
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:15.700]   one man in a one-flesh union for life, this is picturing the union of Christ and the church.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.460]   And it's presenting an invitation to that wedding feast at the end of the gospel story.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.180]   We need to be able to articulate that, and then we need to be able to picture it in healthy
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.780]   marriage cultures in our own churches.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:37.180]   And to expect a lot of people who've never seen that sort of thing at all to say, "Why
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.380]   do you do that?
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.740]   Why do you live that way?
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.680]   Why do you value these things?"
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.380]   Not only so that we can talk about marriage, not only so that we can talk about a biblical
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.140]   view of sexuality, but so that we can talk about the gospel itself.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.260]   I think we're going to have more and more opportunities to do that in the generation
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.260]   to come.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.260]   Amen.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.420]   Some crazy challenges ahead, but a gloriously satisfying Savior to proclaim as well.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   Thank you, Dr. Moore.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.260]   Dr. Moore serves as the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.900]   Baptist Convention, and he will be joining us one more time as we close out the week.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.420]   I'll ask him, as the church feels more and more out of place in culture, what are some
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.180]   wrong ways for the church to respond?
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.300]   I'll ask him that tomorrow as we finish out the week.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.500]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
