[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Last week we talked about the challenge of why our theology does not change our
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.640]   lives quickly, at least not as fast as we wish it would. We also talked about the
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.060]   expulsive power of a new affection, that those new holy affections we have for
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.200]   God help push out of our lives the fallen desires that we have for sin
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.340]   still yet within us. But from those topics emerges another related question,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.440]   namely this one. Realistically speaking, how changed will my desires become in
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   this life? The question is from a listener named Emma. Pastor John, hello, I
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.360]   think I understand Christian hedonism. By the sovereign grace of God in
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.800]   regeneration, God gives me new desires that align with his desires. This
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.640]   includes a new delight in what most delights God, which is himself. Amen and
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.320]   amen. But boy do I sure struggle with a ton of desires within me that are not
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.840]   God honoring. So how in the world can I be sure God has given me new holy
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.360]   desires when I so often feel inundated by my old unholy desires? Even Jesus
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.040]   seemed to be more motivated in his earthly life by future joy, Hebrews 12
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.760]   2. So how much desire victory is realistic and normative in the Christian
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.520]   life inside this fallen flesh and inside this cursed planet? Pastor John, what would
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.320]   you say to Emma? So Emma asks two questions as I'm hearing it. How can I be
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.360]   sure that I have been given new holy desires? And this is really a question of
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.560]   how can I be sure I have been born again because that's what the new birth does.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.400]   It gives us these new God-centered, Christ-exalting, Spirit-empowered desires.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.280]   And the other question she asks is how much desire for God and victory over
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.600]   contrary desires, sinful desires, is realistic or normative for the Christian
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   life? So let's go about answering these two questions this way. Let's describe
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.360]   how the New Testament pictures the desires of the person who has been born
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.000]   again and the kind of battle this introduces into the person's life. And
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   then see if the answers to Emma's questions don't flow from this
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.680]   description of the new birth and what comes with it. Before we're born again—and
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.400]   I mean born again by the Spirit of God, through the Word of God—before we're
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.760]   born again, the Bible describes us as natural persons, meaning we don't have
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.660]   the Holy Spirit and therefore we do not have the spiritual ability to see the
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.600]   beauty of Christ and his gospel for what it really is or the ability to feel them
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.640]   for what they really are, namely precious. 1 Corinthians 2, verse 14, the
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.240]   natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God for they are
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.040]   foolishness to him and he's not able to understand them because they are
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.440]   spiritually discerned. Christ and the gospel are foolishness, folly, unreal,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.400]   boring to us until we are born again and we're no longer natural people
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   but supernatural people. We've been made children of God, inhabited by the
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   supernatural Holy Spirit. Now here's how that happens and the effect of it.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.360]   2 Corinthians 4, 6 and 7 go like this. God, who at the beginning in creation said,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.960]   "Let there be light," has now in our hearts shown—same kind of miracle—shown to give
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.520]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that the surpassing power belongs
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   to God and not to us. In other words, God overcomes—this is what happens in new
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   birth—God overcomes our blindness, our deadness to the glory of God in Christ.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.080]   He shines into our heart with a spiritual—not a physical—but a spiritual
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.840]   light and the result is that we see—Paul calls it the eyes of the heart—we see
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:58.600]   the glory of God in Christ as a treasure. The word "treasure" is used by Paul
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.160]   in verse 7 to describe what he's talking about when it happens. We have this
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.880]   treasure—the one I just referred to back in verse 6—when we saw the glory of God
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.920]   in the face of Christ. We have this treasure in jars of clay. That's our
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.800]   mortal bodies—these fragile, sickness-prone, depression-prone bodies of
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   ours. But the key thing is that the effect of this miracle of sight—seeing
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.020]   Christ and his gospel as beautiful as they really are—the effect is that we
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.840]   now know Christ as a treasure. He's not boring, he's not foolish, he's not
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.720]   mythological anymore. He's a treasure. Our desires, therefore, our preferences, our
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:56.280]   pleasures are transformed by discovering that what we once thought was foolish,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.880]   unreal, boring, is now the most precious reality in the world. That's the
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   fundamental change at new birth. So Jesus describes this transformation like this.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.720]   This is Matthew 13, 44. "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.040]   field which a man found." That's the point of conversion, the point of new birth. He
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   found, he covered up, and then in his joy—because that's what happens when
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   you have your eyes open to a treasure—in his joy, he goes and sells everything he
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.720]   has and buys that field. And then Paul describes it like this in Philippians 3:8.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.640]   "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:48.760]   Jesus my Lord." So the effect of the new birth is that we are made alive
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:57.800]   spiritually by God with the effect that we now see Christ and his gospel as our
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.000]   supreme treasure. We prize him, we love him, we treasure him and enjoy him, are
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:15.640]   satisfied in him more than in our former dearest pleasures. Now here's what causes
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:23.960]   the problem for Emma and for all of us. This new reality does not yet completely
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:32.320]   destroy the old reality called "my flesh." In a sense, a decisive victory has been
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.520]   won over my flesh. I have been crucified with Christ, Paul says, Galatians 2:20.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.000]   Done. Decisive. But in another sense, we must lay hold on this decisive victory
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   by faith, hour by hour, and reckon our old self, our flesh, dead, according to the
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   reality that it really is. We have to make war on the flesh and count ourselves
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   dead as we really are. So Paul says in Galatians 5:16, now here's the reality
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.280]   we're dealing with, "Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.440]   the flesh, for the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.800]   of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other." War.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.560]   These are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things that you want
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:40.200]   to do. And no book in the Bible is more insistent that the new birth produces a
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.080]   real change than John's first epistle. And yet this book emphasizes that we're
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.760]   not sinless. The battle goes on. Here's what he says in 1 John 1, 8, "If we say
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.520]   we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." So we do sin.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.280]   That is, we don't value God the way we ought to. We do value the world
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.220]   sometimes the way we shouldn't. Then he continues, "If we confess our sins, he is
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.480]   faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.140]   And Paul describes his own battle like this, "I delight in the law of God in my
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:25.660]   inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.960]   of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members."
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:38.560]   Romans 7 22. So what should we say? How should we answer Emma's two questions,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.080]   which are really our questions? Number one, "In view of this battle, how can I be
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.460]   sure that I have been given new holy desires?" And my answer is that the
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:57.640]   question is one of authenticity and reality of our desires for Christ, not
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:05.360]   primarily a question of intensity or frequency of the battle. Because we are
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   talking about God-given spiritual delight in the glory of Christ and the
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.520]   beauty of the gospel—a delight which in any quantity the natural person does not
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.240]   have. So pray that the Lord would not only show you the fruit of such
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.320]   spiritual desires, but would by his Spirit bear witness that your sight and
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.840]   your delight in Christ are real, are authentic. That's the work of the Spirit—
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.160]   to witness with your spirit that you have really tasted Christ and your
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:47.040]   desires, however small or big, are the real thing that no natural person has.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.920]   And here's the second and last question. "How much desire for God and victory
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.480]   over sinful desires is realistic or normative for the Christian life?" And I
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:06.280]   would put it something like this. Never expect in this life that you will get
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:15.840]   beyond warfare with your flesh, and never assume that the Lord may not have a far
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:22.600]   greater victory for you than you have ever known. Yes, this fight continues for
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.840]   us all. Thank you, Pastor John. And whether you listen in the car or at the gym or

[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.320]   prayer, specifically prayerlessness, if we are not happy with our prayer lives, how
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   can we kick-start this essential discipline? Pastor John has three very
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.040]   practical suggestions that will help us out. That's up next time. I'm your host,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.480]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
