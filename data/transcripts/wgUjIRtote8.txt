[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.020]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.760]   My guest today is Dr. Teo Soleimani.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.340]   Dr. Teo Soleimani is a double board certified dermatologist
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.920]   and dermatologic surgeon.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.880]   He did his training at Stanford University,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.380]   and he was a clinical professor of dermatology
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.720]   and dermatologic surgery at UCLA.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.140]   That is the University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.220]   Today, we discuss all things related to skin appearance,
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.180]   skin health, and skin longevity.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.300]   For instance, we discuss sun exposure
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.580]   and the impact it can have
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.540]   on both the appearance and health of one's skin.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.940]   In reference to that, we discuss sunscreens,
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.980]   which ones are safe,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.640]   which ones perhaps elicit a bit more concern
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.180]   or perhaps should be avoided.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.260]   And we discuss the surprising relationship
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.540]   between sun exposure and skin cancer.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.340]   We discuss laser treatments for the skin,
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.560]   both for the appearance of skin
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.380]   in order to make it appear more youthful,
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.760]   as well as to prevent certain forms of skin cancer.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.060]   We discuss retinoids, we discuss supplements and nutrition,
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.460]   all in reference, again, to skin health and appearance.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.900]   Thanks to Dr. Soleimani's incredible depth of expertise,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.940]   as well as clarity of communication
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.100]   about the do's and do nots
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.140]   that relate to skin care and appearance
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.860]   and to avoiding and treating skin cancers,
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.400]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.980]   you will be armed with an immense amount of knowledge
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.420]   that is the very latest in our understanding
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.300]   of how to improve and protect your skin.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.260]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.620]   that this podcast is separate
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.960]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.260]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.620]   to the general public.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.700]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.440]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380]   Our first sponsor is Roka.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.420]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.760]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.480]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.440]   of the visual system,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.880]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.740]   of different challenges
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.560]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   from moment to moment.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.720]   Roka understands all of that
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.240]   and has designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.880]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.360]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   were first designed for use in sport,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.320]   in particular for things like running and cycling,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.400]   and as a consequence, Roka frames are extremely lightweight,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.480]   so much so that most of the time
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.240]   you don't even remember that you're wearing them,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.400]   and they're also designed so that they don't slip off
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.920]   even if you get sweaty.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.880]   Now, even though Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.640]   were initially designed for sport,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.580]   they now have many different frames and styles,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640]   all of which can be used not just for sport,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.680]   but also for wearing out to dinner, to work,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.080]   essentially any time and any setting.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.560]   I wear Roka readers at night
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.080]   or Roka eyeglasses if I'm driving at night,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.380]   and I wear Roka sunglasses in the middle of the day
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.200]   anytime it's too bright for me to see clearly.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.500]   My eyes are somewhat sensitive, so I need that.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.300]   I particularly like the Hunter 2.0 frames,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.780]   which I have as eyeglasses and now as sunglasses too.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.960]   If you'd like to try Roka,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.660]   you can go to roka.com/huberman
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.300]   to get 20% off your purchase.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.380]   Again, that's roka.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.420]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.460]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.260]   on this podcast, it's the incredible impact
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.180]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.560]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.300]   red light and near infrared light
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.920]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.940]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.540]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.500]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.620]   even improvements in acne, reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.180]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.240]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.700]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.440]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.580]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.860]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.940]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.420]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.580]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.060]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.540]   It's only about the size of a sandwich,
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.780]   so it's super portable and convenient to use.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.480]   I also have a Juve whole body panel,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.180]   and I use that about three or four times per week.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.380]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.380]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.180]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.760]   to all Huberman Loud listeners
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.680]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.600]   Again, that's Juve, J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.480]   to get $400 off select Juve products.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.480]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.360]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.760]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.200]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.760]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.280]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.680]   Now, the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.140]   in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.960]   We need a mattress that is matched
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.720]   to our unique sleep needs,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.320]   one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.900]   one that breathes well
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.580]   and that won't be too warm or too cold for you.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.060]   If you go to the Helix website,
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.580]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.260]   and it asks you questions such as,
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.040]   do you sleep on your back, your side of your stomach?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.120]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.420]   Things of that sort.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.280]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.120]   maybe you don't.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.520]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.140]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.200]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.180]   I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress for,
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.400]   gosh, no, more than four years.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.700]   And the sleep that I've been getting
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.500]   is absolutely phenomenal.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.700]   If you'd like to try Helix,
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.620]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.240]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.060]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.460]   that is customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.860]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.020]   and two free pillows.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.140]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.140]   to get 25% off and two free pillows.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.620]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Teo Soleimani.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.540]   Dr. Teo Soleimani, welcome.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.500]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.420]   It's awesome to be here.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.640]   Very, very privileged to be here, thank you.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.100]   - Oh, well, it's an honor to have you.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.900]   Let's talk about this amazing organ we call skin.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   So skin, of course, covers our other organs.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.760]   It's its own living biological entity.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.580]   And just for sake of educational purposes
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.460]   and to frame the rest of what we're going to talk about,
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.780]   how much turnover is there in our skin?
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.700]   Meaning the skin that I'm wearing right now,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.700]   is that going to be 100%, 50% of the skin
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.060]   that I'm going to be wearing a year from now?
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.740]   I'm 49 years old, so.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.160]   - Well, you look great for 49,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.240]   so whatever you're doing, keep it up.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.220]   So the skin's an amazing organ, just like you said.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.500]   It's the largest organ,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.780]   the largest dynamic organ we have in our body.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.860]   You have new skin, brand new skin, every 28 days.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.640]   So the surface of your skin turns over about every month.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.860]   Now the stem cells,
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.940]   which are in the lowest portion of our epidermis,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.540]   remain and they generate the skin cells,
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.180]   but you have brand new skin
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.660]   the same way you have new gut lining every 28 days.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.640]   It's amazing for many reasons,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.580]   because the skin is one of the few organs
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.700]   that can regenerate because of this.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.100]   So you can grow new skin, you can test things on skin.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.800]   If your skin gets injured,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.260]   it will regenerate and heal itself.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.900]   Whereas many other organs cannot do that.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.060]   And because of this,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.620]   it also allows us to use it as a model platform
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.060]   for studying diseases of all kinds.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.700]   So skin's an amazing organ.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.580]   I mean, I guess I'm biased, but.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.580]   - Well, I find a 28-day turnover just to be incredible.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.800]   The skin, as I understand it, is innervated.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.920]   That is, it receives connections from the nervous system.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.740]   So I think for many people,
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.060]   their interest in skin is skin appearance,
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.880]   although we will also talk about skin health.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.920]   But in terms of skin appearance,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.880]   how much does stress, short-term and longer-term stress,
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.540]   impact the appearance of our skin?
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.420]   And how does that work?
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.480]   I could imagine that the neurons release certain things
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   into the skin.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.880]   Does stress make our skin age faster?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   Does that mean it turns over more quickly
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.400]   or turns over more slowly?
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.740]   Maybe you could link these two aspects
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.240]   of our biology for us.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.160]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.620]   So in order to understand that,
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.860]   we have to just look at the structure of the skin.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.560]   So the skin generally is three layers,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   the epidermis, the dermis, and the subcutaneous fat.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.100]   And the dermis is where most
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.980]   of the biologic activity resides.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.340]   That's where our blood vessels are.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.740]   That's where the nerves that innervate sensation
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.260]   and movement reside.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260]   That's where our hair follicles, oil glands,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.340]   and sweat glands reside.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.980]   So stress has two components.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.420]   There's what we call acute stress,
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.000]   meaning stress that happens within a short period of time.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.420]   And then there's long-term stress or chronic stress.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.120]   And both have different processes in the skin.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.880]   And you see the results of stress
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   both immediately in the skin
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.220]   with release of certain chemical messengers
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.580]   in an autocrine, paracrine, and holocrine fashion.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.580]   And then you see the long-term deleterious effects
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.500]   of stress in a different mechanism
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.620]   in which there's actually breakdown of the skin.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.500]   The easiest way to see this is when people are stressed
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.260]   and they lose their hair.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.700]   And the hair obviously is an extension of our skin.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.300]   It's a biosensor of our wellbeing.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.940]   And we see this all the time.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.500]   You know, I see students during finals time
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.700]   where they're really stressed out
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.780]   and they're coming with their hair falling out.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.740]   Or after a large medical illness or a pregnancy,
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.020]   patients will come in and say their hair is falling out.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.140]   So that acute stress is seen right away.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.720]   And that's due to several different reasons
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.860]   and release of messengers and hormones
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.620]   and chemical mediators that do this.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.300]   Long-term stress is usually mitigated
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.200]   or caused by cortisol.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.700]   And everybody knows cortisol.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.380]   It's the fundamental stress hormone of our body.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.300]   It falls in the same family
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.340]   as drugs that we give like prednisone.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.580]   Falls in the same family
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.020]   of cholesterol, testosterone, and estrogen.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.500]   But cortisol does something very different.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.580]   It breaks things down to allow our body
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.860]   to utilize it in times of stress.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.820]   'Cause unfortunately, our body doesn't understand
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.020]   the difference between 21st century stress and old stress.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.220]   So us being chased by a lion
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.500]   to our body's messaging system
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.120]   is the same as meeting chronic deadlines at work.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.860]   And what happens is cortisol is responsible
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.980]   for the breakdown of things like collagen and elastin,
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.580]   thinning of vessel walls,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.140]   which allow our skin to look supple and healthy.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.660]   So as we have a lot of stress
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.060]   and a lot of cortisol release, we see aging.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.540]   And there's accelerated aging studies
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.340]   that look at patients and people
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.420]   who are under high periods of stress.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.300]   A great example of studies, we look at presidents
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.560]   in which they appear to have aged much more rapidly
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.660]   than matched controls in a four-year period of time.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.360]   So stress plays a really important role.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.120]   You see it both immediately and long-term.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   - I guess people rarely are sympathetic
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.900]   to presidents for aging quickly,
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.820]   because I guess if there were a president
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.440]   who did not age quickly,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.700]   we would worry they did not work hard enough
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.760]   or something of that sort.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.180]   But the relationship between stress and skin fascinates me
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.660]   because not just of the direct relationship,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.740]   like when we see people and they're stressed,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.660]   like it seems like the power of their skin changes,
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.500]   the kind of level of gleam in their eyes change.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.500]   And of course the eyes are a direct piece
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.540]   of the nervous system, really.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.460]   They're as close to the brain
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.380]   as one can get outside the skull.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.700]   But it also suggests because of the dynamic turnover
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.740]   of skin every 28 days,
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.620]   that if people were to become less stressed
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.380]   that their skin health and appearance might improve.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.540]   Is that also the case?
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.380]   - For sure.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.620]   It's why you see people have a glow after vacation,
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.740]   but you can't quantify that in a test tube or a lab.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.940]   So in the immediate phase,
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.340]   there's a big shift in blood flow to the skin.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.660]   And when you're feeling very stressed out,
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.780]   immediately there's a fight or flight response
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.340]   that constricts the blood vessels in our skin
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.780]   to shuffle them to muscles
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.540]   and places where our body thinks
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.040]   we need to utilize them more.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.620]   That's why when people are really stressed out,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.340]   they may look pale or gaunt.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.020]   And we see that right away.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.880]   And then as that builds up over time,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.700]   the health, the actual quality of our dermis and fat
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.260]   deteriorate from chronic stress changes,
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.940]   mainly due to cortisol and its sibling hormones
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.140]   and messaging systems in our skin.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.980]   So for sure, I mean, stress is like
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.940]   something that is impossible to quantify in a lab measure,
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.100]   but very easily seen on exam.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.100]   Just looking at your skin,
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.620]   I can tell you've had either a rough day.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.680]   If you didn't sleep well,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.740]   you can see it in your skin, in your eyes.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.140]   So absolutely, I mean,
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.980]   that's why everybody likes to live a stress-free life.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   And we see changes and improvement in skin health
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.300]   when people move away from that stressor,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.740]   whether it's a physical stressor,
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.720]   emotional stressor, psychosocial stressor,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.740]   there is actual quantifiable improvements in skin health.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.780]   And that's pretty fascinating.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.420]   - It is fascinating.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.540]   It also speaks to the value of having some immediate
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.260]   and long-term stress reduction techniques,
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.220]   just as a sort of first principle
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.860]   of taking care of one's skin.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.620]   There are some other things that cause vasoconstriction,
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.020]   the basically the tightening of the vessels
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.460]   and capillaries to the skin, as I understand.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.420]   Maybe we could just tick through a few of these
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.360]   and get your sense.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.220]   I consume caffeine every morning,
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.240]   usually yerba mate tea, some coffee a little bit later.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.000]   Those will increase vasoconstriction to some extent,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.800]   although chronic caffeine intake may cause vasodilation.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.100]   So I'd like to know the relationship between caffeine
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.760]   and blood flow to the skin and skin health and appearance.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.800]   That's the first question.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   And then dovetailed with that question is nicotine,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.000]   which is also thought to be a vasoconstrictor.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.940]   It raises blood pressure because it's a vasoconstrictor.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.940]   What are the effects of caffeine,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.460]   both acutely and chronically, and nicotine?
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.220]   Let's assume that nicotine is consumed either by smoking
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.100]   or oral ingestion on skin appearance and health.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.940]   - That's a good question.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.260]   So caffeine is a known vasoconstrictor.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.580]   Fortunately, when it's consumed in quantities
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.620]   that we have in coffee, tea, and equivalent beverages,
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.800]   the amount that affects the tiny capillaries
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.180]   and arterioles in our skin is minute and transient.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.380]   So you may get a transient vasoconstriction
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.220]   with high caffeine intake,
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.900]   but usually there's a compensatory vasodilation
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.420]   as a result.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.440]   So the effects on skin are not as dramatic
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.580]   as people may make it seem.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.260]   Now, one thing that we do see,
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.080]   and it's a little unclear as to why,
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.420]   is that people who have chronic high caffeine intake
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.860]   tend to produce more sebum in their skin.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.120]   And it may be a result of vasoconstriction,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.700]   may be a result of something that we don't understand
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.340]   that's compensatory as a result of those changes.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.520]   So a lot of people who consume coffee
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.600]   may experience a little bit oilier skin.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.640]   That being said, the data's equivocal
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.160]   as to whether or not caffeine has a deleterious,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.000]   beneficial, or net neutral effect on the skin.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.480]   I drink a lot of coffee.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.320]   I haven't found that the vasoconstriction
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.640]   is something that's noticeable,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.300]   but there are people who have different skin types,
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.800]   patients who have rosacea, for example,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.960]   who are much more sensitive to those changes.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.640]   They may notice that change in the color
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.360]   in the vasoconstriction more with caffeine consumption.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.800]   What used to be thought was that caffeine itself
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.760]   was a problem for flushing and redness.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.320]   And now we've realized it's actually not so much
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.080]   the caffeine because the concentration
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.320]   that reaches the skin is so minuscule.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.360]   It's actually the temperature of the beverages we drink.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.120]   So hot beverages can affect the color of your skin,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.360]   can make you flush more, make the redness more pronounced.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.280]   Cold beverages tend not to have that effect.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.420]   So it used to be an old adage
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.300]   in people who had like rosacea, for example,
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.040]   we'd say don't drink coffee, don't drink tea.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.920]   It's actually the temperature of the beverage,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.960]   not so much the caffeine content.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.160]   - Interesting, and what about nicotine?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.760]   - So nicotine, great question.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.020]   It is a known vasoconstrictor.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.380]   Now, the concentration of nicotine when smoked
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.760]   is higher in the skin because of inhalational effects
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.440]   and the local effect of nicotine on our skin.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.000]   So you do see a measurable vasoconstriction in the skin
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.480]   that becomes a problem,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.440]   which is why patients who smoke age faster.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.320]   Patients who had surgery who smoke have a higher risk
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.440]   for poor wound outcomes, for poor healing
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.160]   because of that vasoconstriction.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   Usually people who use or consume nicotine
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.280]   aren't doing it once a week.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.680]   Most people are using it daily or multiple times a day.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.520]   So that chronic vasoconstriction adds up
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.800]   and has a net negative effect on the skin.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.880]   So if you want to keep your skin healthy,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.920]   if you want to look younger,
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.720]   I would refrain from nicotine use.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.700]   - What about vaping nicotine or oral use of nicotine?
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.560]   So nicotine gum, mints, pouches.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   And let's touch on vaping first
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.360]   because that's becoming more common.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.980]   - So with vaping, we see the same problems in the skin.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.200]   We don't know if it's an inhalational issue
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.900]   or if it's actually the same concentration of nicotine
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.940]   that's reaching local skin causing the effect,
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.620]   but we see the same vasoconstriction
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.440]   when you match cigarette smoke with vaping
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.960]   if you have the same nicotine content.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.080]   Now for patches and gum, it's less of a problem.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.240]   And why that is, is the concentration of nicotine
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.840]   that reaches the skin is much lower.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.040]   Usually when you chew it,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   it has to go through your digestive tract,
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.100]   then enter your bloodstream,
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.560]   then reach the surface of the skin.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.000]   When you have a transdermal patch,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.580]   it still goes through the bloodstream,
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.720]   then ends up in the skin.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.400]   So because of how much it has to be processed,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.280]   the concentration that reaches the skin is much lower.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.960]   When we operate, when we do surgery,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   with any surgery of any kind,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   we try to transition people who smoke or vape
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.840]   to at least gums or patches
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.880]   to mitigate their withdrawal effect,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.960]   but, you know, so they don't have the feelings,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.320]   but, you know, it doesn't have
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.760]   the same constrictive effects on their skin.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.720]   - What about alcohol?
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.880]   You know, I did an episode of this podcast on alcohol,
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.320]   which somewhat to my surprise, you know,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.920]   was very widely shared, only to my surprise,
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.080]   because I've never been a big consumer of alcohol,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.460]   but apparently many out there are.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.000]   And the data came back, at least to my understanding,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.600]   that zero alcohol is healthier than any,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.440]   and that up to two drinks per week is probably okay,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.000]   as long as you're an adult of drinking age
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and not an alcoholic.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.720]   You don't have issues with alcohol use disorder,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.200]   as it's now called, probably okay.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.140]   But beyond that, you start running into some health issues
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.040]   that can be offset by better behaviors of other types.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   But what about the direct effects of alcohol on skin
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.120]   in the short term?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.320]   Does it increase blood flow and therefore improve skin?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.640]   Are there long-term indirect effects?
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.720]   I could imagine that alcohol disrupts the gut microbiome,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.600]   which then disrupts skin, et cetera.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.920]   So maybe we could break this down into direct acute effects,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.860]   meaning immediate effects that are really direct
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.580]   from consuming alcohol that day, that week, let's say,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.640]   versus chronic effects through other systems
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.760]   like disruption of sleep and microbiome.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.920]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.480]   Alcohol and skin connections, complicated, convoluted,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.240]   but generally thought to be a net negative,
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.120]   both short-term and long-term.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.780]   So first, alcohol tends to be a mild diuretic.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.440]   So it makes our body dispose of water
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.820]   a little bit more frequently.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.080]   What happens short-term is that, one,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.260]   you get almost a mild diuretic effect
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.440]   from alcohol consumption,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   which is why you tend to be thirsty
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.620]   in the middle of the night and wake up in the morning,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.680]   tend to be parched.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.360]   As a result, you see that diuretic effect on our skin.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.040]   You see a little bit of hollowing in areas
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.000]   that you'd have normal volume and suppleness,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.720]   which is why people tend to see bags under their eyes
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.400]   or they look like they had a hangover
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   is from that mild diuretic effect.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.400]   Also, as a compensatory mechanism,
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.840]   the skin produces a bit more sebum
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.040]   to compensate for that drying out effect.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.460]   So in the acute phase, your skin dries out,
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.480]   you look a little bit worse
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.780]   because of that diuretic effect.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.160]   In patients who cannot,
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.000]   or people who cannot tolerate alcohol,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.200]   and there are genetics in Asian populations
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.640]   and Southeast Asians that have a difficulty
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.880]   in breaking down acetaldehyde,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   that is a toxin that shows up in the skin
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.760]   and makes the skin vasodilate as a result.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.080]   So that common college term that we used to hear,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.440]   you know, the flush or the glow,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.120]   or incorrectly called the Asian glow,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.800]   is as a result of the inability to break down alcohol.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.640]   And that usually you see immediately.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.200]   People get a very bright red flush in their skin
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.820]   because of the acetaldehyde buildup in the skin.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.760]   Long-term, one, the diuretic effect becomes a problem.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.360]   So over time, your skin's producing constantly more sebum
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   to keep the skin supple.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.240]   Your skin is drying out.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.760]   And as a result, you run into things like breakouts
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.480]   and congested skin, you know, blackheads, whiteheads,
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.320]   things like that.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.200]   And long-term alcohol use is also associated
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.600]   with lifestyle choices that may make your skin health worse.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.360]   Generally speaking, when people are out binge drinking,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.760]   they tend not to come home
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.560]   and do things that'll maintain their skin.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.240]   Now, that's not a fixed rule,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.040]   but most of the time when you're out, you know,
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   having a few beers or cocktails at the bar,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.420]   you tend to come home
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.160]   and not do your diligent skincare routine,
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.920]   or you may not be up, you know,
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.040]   with your hydration status or your dietary habits.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.680]   So that's something we can't quantify easily,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.480]   but contributes significantly
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.800]   to faster aging, poor skin health.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.160]   Then the gut microbiome question.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.160]   This is a great question
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   because the data is widely variable for alcohol consumption
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.440]   and the effects or changes permanent or transient
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.280]   in the gut microbiome.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.000]   There are some alcohol products like kombucha
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.240]   that has a higher alcohol concentration
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.780]   that's healthy for your gut.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.760]   Then there's hard alcohols with a higher concentration
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.040]   that act as anesthetics and act as gut paralytics.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.760]   So one of the things we see in people
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.080]   who consume a lot of high percentage alcohols
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.840]   is actually gut immobility and gut paralysis,
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.620]   partly because of the anesthetic effect,
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.080]   partly because of the analgesic effect of alcohol,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.300]   and also because it affects gut motility as a toxin.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.500]   So generally speaking, the gut health,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.780]   depending on your consumption patterns,
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.300]   use and concentration can be very deleterious.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.140]   Some people are very sensitive
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.980]   and they have changes that reflect in the skin
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.860]   as a result of drinking a lot.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.900]   And then there are some people who tolerate it more
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.220]   or maybe consuming things that are healthier
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.380]   for the gut microbiome,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.060]   like things like fermented alcohols,
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.180]   like kombucha and things like that.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.760]   So generally speaking, the higher the concentration,
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.400]   the greater the problems,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.840]   the higher the percentage of alcohol,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.080]   the greater the problems.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.040]   That includes the diuretic effects,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.880]   that includes effects on the gut microbiome,
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.700]   that includes lifestyle habits.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.920]   If you're drinking a lot of higher percentage alcohols,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.040]   you tend to feel the effects,
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.400]   not just in the skin cognitively, behavior-wise,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.240]   that can affect you.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.080]   Whereas sometimes lower concentration alcohols,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.760]   depending on the setting and lifestyle,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.980]   may be net neutral, may be positive.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.120]   I'm clear on that part.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.700]   - But I'm not hearing any positive effects of alcohol
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.540]   on skin health or any of this.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.900]   - Generally not, generally not.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.840]   Same as what we've seen with other organ systems,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.340]   the brain, the liver, the skin reflects the same thing.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.380]   If anything, it may be a net neutral.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.740]   Most of the time, it's a net negative.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.500]   - And what I'm pulling from all of the discussion
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.880]   we've had up until now is that improved blood flow
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.700]   and strong hydration status are both important.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.980]   Do you recommend patients drink a certain amount of fluid
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.940]   each day or maintain adequate hydration
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.620]   as a means to build or maintain skin health and appearance?
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.460]   - Great question.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.120]   So that's another common misconception that I see
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.820]   in that thinking drinking a lot of water will,
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.860]   or drinking a lot of fluids will directly affect
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.900]   the hydration status of their skin.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.080]   And while there's a certain degree of truth to that,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.940]   if you're dehydrated and that you need replenishment
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.220]   of fluid systemically, every study that's looked
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.100]   at transepidermal water loss has not shown
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.500]   a great connection with regular fluid intake
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.660]   and water intake and skin hydration status.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.100]   We find that that tends to be genetically defined
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.140]   and genetically encoded.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.880]   Some people have drier skin.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.680]   They need more methods to moisturize their skin.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.820]   Some people have oilier skin and their sebum provides
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.820]   that moisturization.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.100]   Now, if you're doing things, if you're active,
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.340]   if you're an athlete, if you're doing things
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.500]   in which you are dehydrated, then totally different story.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.980]   But if you're living a more or less balanced life
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.540]   or a sedentary life and you're doing all the regular things,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.760]   drinking a lot of water or fluids has not been shown
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.320]   to improve skin health.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.020]   So that's why generally speaking,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.820]   most dermatologists will recommend some sort
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.280]   of moisturizer to replenish that.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.940]   But you gotta know your skin.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.340]   For example, my skin, I tend to be oilier.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.980]   I don't usually need a moisturizer as much.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.060]   Whereas somebody who is drier will need some sort
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   of barrier protection to allow,
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.860]   to minimize that trans-epidermal water loss.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.420]   - What are some of the parameters
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.360]   for selecting a moisturizer?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.620]   - Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.180]   - People are immediately gonna go into say,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.620]   well, what constitutes a good moisturizer?
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.700]   What should it have in it?
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.980]   What are some things to avoid?
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.540]   - Yeah, it's a crazy market.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.860]   There's a lot of things out there.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.940]   You can Google skin snail moisturizer
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.660]   and you'll find people putting snail mucin
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.340]   on their skin as a moisturizer.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.580]   - You were telling me before this recording started,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.660]   there are people who, and forgive me
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.000]   for those that cringe when I say this,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.500]   that put placental extract.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.220]   - Human placenta as a means
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.940]   of rejuvenating their skin health.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.860]   I don't advocate it or don't say anything against it,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.500]   but I probably wouldn't recommend it.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.920]   There's better, safer, more cost-effective ways
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.340]   of doing this.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.460]   Simple things you wanna look for.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   One, is it non-comedogenic?
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.580]   That's a word you wanna look for
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.300]   for any moisturizer that's been tested
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.080]   not to clog your pores.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.940]   That's a basic thing to look for
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.760]   where you won't cause another problem
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.820]   in trying to fix one problem.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.580]   Number two, how oily or dry are you?
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.200]   Generally speaking, there are three flavors of moisturizers.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.460]   There's ointments, there's creams, and there's lotions.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.740]   Ointments are greasy.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.060]   They're like petrolatum jelly or Vaseline-based.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.200]   Those are the best for moisturizing your skin,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.600]   but they're greasy.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.460]   Then there's creams, which are water emulsions
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.100]   with oil suspended in it.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.420]   And then there's lotions, which are generally powders
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.060]   that are resuspended with water.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.500]   We as dermatologists tend to like the greasier the better.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.340]   It provides the best barrier protection,
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.740]   but you have to know your skin.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.220]   If you're somebody that is eczema-prone,
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.540]   you will need something that is an ointment
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.340]   that does better to protect the skin from drying out.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.060]   If you're somebody that is acne-prone,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.900]   you won't tolerate greasy things.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.800]   You'll break out more.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.100]   So you wanna look for a lighter moisturizer
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.560]   that's non-comedogenic.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.400]   So in a long story short,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.540]   it's very person-to-person specific.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.520]   You gotta know your skin,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.000]   but the fundamental things you wanna look for is
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.660]   has this been tested to not clog pores?
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.100]   And is it in a pump bottle or is it in a jar?
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.120]   Jars tend to be more occlusive.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.660]   They tend to provide more moisturization,
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.340]   but they can lead to problems like acne and breakouts.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.500]   Whereas things in a pump bottle,
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.560]   because they're powders in suspension
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.180]   and they have to put alcohol in the product
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.940]   to allow it to come out of the pump mechanism,
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.980]   they tend to be lighter
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.460]   and not provide as much moisturization.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.140]   - I see.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.660]   So when I think about something in a jar,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.580]   you have something like Aquaphor or something,
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.220]   which is pretty thick, thick stuff.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.980]   So that would be fine for someone with eczema,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.580]   not okay for somebody with acne.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.140]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.100]   The greasier, the more occlusion it provides,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.580]   but in doing so, it clogs everything.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.260]   Now, if you're one that has some sort of skin issue
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.820]   in which you need that, it's the best thing.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.180]   If you're one that is breaking out all the time,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.100]   you want something lighter.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.340]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.980]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.580]   By now, many of you have heard me say
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.340]   that if I could take just one supplement,
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.420]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.940]   The reason for that is AG1 is the highest quality
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.860]   and most complete
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.600]   of the foundational nutritional supplements available.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.020]   What that means is that it contains
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.420]   not just vitamins and minerals,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.820]   but also probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.220]   to cover any gaps you may have in your diet
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.500]   and provide support for a demanding life.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.340]   For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.560]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.500]   which I do for most of my food intake,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.300]   and vegetables, vitamins and minerals,
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.380]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.820]   For that reason, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.500]   and often twice a day, once in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.500]   and again in the afternoon or evening.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.900]   When I do that, it clearly bolsters my energy,
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.500]   my immune system, and my gut microbiome.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.660]   These are all critical to brain function, mood,
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.900]   physical performance, and much more.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.380]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.500]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.080]   to claim their special offer.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.200]   Right now, they're giving away five free travel packs
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.080]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.700]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.880]   to claim that special offer.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.760]   Why do people wake up with bags under their eyes
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   if they just slept for six or eight hours?
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.680]   - Yeah, well, maybe you need a little bit more sleep
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.360]   or maybe you had a wild night, I can't tell,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.900]   but generally, the bags are caused by two things.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.560]   One, fluid retention.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.440]   So there's some lymphatic change that occurs under the eyes
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.960]   that's most noticeable because the skin under our eyes
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.760]   and on the surface of our eyelids is the thinnest.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.320]   So fluid changes are seen the quickest there.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.560]   And as we're in a supine or prone position,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.440]   fluid moves from our extremities
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.120]   back to our central venous system,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   and it's easier to collect in the face.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.160]   So we see it around the face.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.280]   The other thing that we do notice with bags
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.920]   is just age-related fat herniation that shows up more
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.740]   as we wake up because of positional changes.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.740]   So if you've had a heavy meal the night before,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.960]   something that has a high salt content,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.940]   you're gonna retain a little bit more water
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.560]   because of that solute shift.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.800]   You may notice your eyes are puffier in the morning.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   If you have allergies, seasonal allergies,
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.760]   asthma, eczema, they run in a family,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.360]   that tends to make your skin retain a little bit more water
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.800]   as a result of that allergy response.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.600]   So people will notice springtime or fall time,
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.080]   their eyes are swollen or their eyes are puffy,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.520]   especially when their allergies are flaring.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   It's a product of water retention
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.560]   from all the histamine release
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.320]   and changes that occur in the skin.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.960]   - Skin cleansing is a topic that gets a lot of coverage.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.220]   And I sometimes get chuckles or even attacks
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   for saying I've always just used unscented dove soap,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.460]   the bar, not the liquid soap, or like a Cetaphil soap.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.500]   And this is because when I was younger, like much younger,
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.620]   I had very sensitive skin when I was like a kid,
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.700]   seven, eight, nine years old.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.820]   I think I just started using unscented dove soap
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.620]   at some point and things like it,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.700]   gentle soaps without fragrances.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.860]   What are your thoughts on those?
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.780]   And I ask not for my own purposes,
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.300]   I'm gonna stick with it because it works for me,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.900]   unless you tell me I shouldn't,
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.900]   but I see this enormous market for skin cleansers
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.500]   that includes a range of costs
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.980]   from relatively low to near astronomical.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.220]   And if you tell me that this unscented dove soap
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.940]   or Cetaphil soap is the way to go,
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.860]   and by the way, I'm not sponsored by either of those,
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.260]   I don't even know who they're manufactured by,
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.140]   so there's no commercial angle here,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.980]   but I'll be relieved because they tend to fall
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.500]   on the lower end of the cost bracket
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.940]   relative to some of these astronomically priced cleansers.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.580]   - Skincare is a incredible multi-billion dollar market.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.740]   That being said, there is not a shred of evidence
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.940]   that anything more expensive works better
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.720]   than anything cost-effective, so that's first and foremost.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.780]   Number two, dove white bar soap is amazing.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.140]   It's what we recommend for newborns and kids
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   with sensitive skin.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.620]   Generally, when we say sensitive skin,
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.380]   especially in kids, toddlers, and adolescents,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.580]   there's a component of some sort of eczema
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.500]   or atopic dermatitis that is not bad enough
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.900]   to have a diagnosis, but enough to say,
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.720]   I had sensitive skin.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.360]   So dove white bar soap is what I use for my kids,
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.000]   and I'm not sponsored by anybody either,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.220]   but I think it's an amazing product because it's safe,
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.860]   it's effective, it has the least amount of ingredients,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.340]   no fragrances, these are all things that can irritate
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.900]   or cause an allergic response to skin that is sensitive,
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.420]   meaning your skin mounts an immune response
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.860]   to some sort of environmental allergen or trigger.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.820]   That's what we generally mean
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.740]   when we talk about sensitive skin.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.520]   I personally use Cetaphil, that's my face wash.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.960]   I have oily skin, and I use the one
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.820]   that takes off more of the oil.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.300]   So what you're looking for is defined by what bothers you
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.140]   or what your skin predicament is.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:54.020]   What I do see as a problem nowadays
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.740]   is particularly in the United States,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.160]   we're a hyper-hygienic society.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.140]   So what people tend to do is over-cleanse,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.340]   and they over-cleanse for several reasons.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.420]   One, because they are told that cleansing
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.980]   will fix their skin issue,
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.580]   or number two, they're told that some sort of organism
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.100]   is on their skin or some sort of bacteria
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.860]   that needs to be cleansed off to keep their skin healthy.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.940]   Neither are true.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.620]   The first thing you want in terms of a cleanser
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.240]   is something that's mild, fragrance-free,
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.420]   and has been tested to be hypoallergenic or non-comedogenic.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.260]   That's first.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.680]   Cetaphil, Dove, CeraVe, great, great stuff.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.220]   No association with any of them.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.220]   - The unscented, non-fragranced versions of them.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.060]   - Exactly, that's first.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.780]   Fragrances tend to be a problem for sensitive skin
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.580]   in patients who have atopic dermatitis or eczema.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.700]   They tend to trigger allergic responses
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.880]   or exacerbations of their eczema flare,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.720]   so we try to avoid fragrances by all means.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.060]   Then, things that are gels or liquids
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.940]   tend to have preservatives in them
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.340]   to increase shelf stability, whereas bars tend not to.
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.180]   So if you are gonna pick something
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.620]   that is a gel, a liquid,
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.340]   look for one that's been tested by a dermatology group
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.780]   or verified by the American Academy of Dermatology
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   as one that is not allergenic or has multiple preservatives
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.020]   because that's another well-known
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.340]   but unidentified source of problems.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.260]   Well-known to the dermatology world,
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.780]   not known to the average person
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.960]   that the preservatives in our cleansers are a problem.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.660]   Over-cleansing becomes really problematic
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.420]   in eradicating the skin microbiome.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.460]   So what we see a lot of times are cleansers
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   that are either bactericidal, bacteristatics,
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.300]   things like benzoyl peroxide, things like salicylic acid,
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.140]   things like certain astringent toners
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.460]   that are alcohol-based, and what they do
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.540]   is not only do they strip the normal oils from our skin
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.620]   that keep our skin supple and healthy,
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.020]   but they eradicate the normal host skin microbiome.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.820]   Those are all the microorganisms that live on our skin,
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.820]   and we have trillions of them actively surveying our skin,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.380]   living in normal symbiotic homeostasis,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.660]   meaning they're our friends,
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.940]   they're living there for a reason,
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.600]   they don't cause any problems.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.480]   But when you cleanse them off,
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.140]   you open up an area for pathogens to take effect,
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.780]   and that's when we see a lot of problems,
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.900]   more so in industrialized countries.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.060]   The United States is a notorious place for washing,
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.780]   especially after COVID, wash, wash, wash, wash more,
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.220]   use a toner, wash some more,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.940]   and that becomes really problematic
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.240]   because it sets up for organisms to take seed
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.700]   when they shouldn't be there.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.260]   So overall, cleansing is great,
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.580]   and the amount that you need to cleanse
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.740]   is based on how oily or sebaceous your skin is.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.100]   The older you get, you may not need to cleanse as much.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.980]   Older patients don't need to cleanse their skin
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.780]   at all every day because they don't produce
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.100]   as much sebum or oil as younger patients.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.580]   But everything should be defined
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.780]   by your skin's characteristics.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.020]   So if you are one in which you notice,
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.000]   by the end of the day, I'm oily, I'm breaking out,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.380]   cleansing may be something that's beneficial for you
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.460]   to take off that excess sebum.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.100]   If you're one that has dry skin,
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.100]   if you're one that had sensitive skin as a child,
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.980]   then over-cleansing is gonna be a problem.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.780]   You're gonna wanna minimize that
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.560]   and keep that moisturization
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.900]   or that barrier protection going.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.860]   - So does that mean that people should bathe
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.380]   probably once or twice a day,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.660]   but the people that are bathing three times a day,
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.900]   it's probably excessive?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.500]   I mean, are we saying that you can't get into water?
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.580]   I mean, when you say cleansing,
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.980]   you're talking about face cleansing.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.820]   I realize this is going to be highly individual,
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.380]   but some people are just out of habit,
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.380]   shower and use cleanser twice a day or once a day.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.820]   I think for me, it's in the morning or in the evening,
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:08.660]   sometimes both.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.140]   If I do a workout, I try and shower
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.380]   as close as possible after the workout,
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.500]   as soon as possible after the workout, rather,
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.740]   because otherwise I will break out.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.020]   So it sounds like one has to kind of learn
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.900]   what their cadence is, and that's going to vary by age.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.420]   There's a lot of factors to this.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.580]   I think Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.700]   famously said they shower, I think,
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.020]   once a week or something like that,
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.980]   and it stirred up a lot of conversation when that came out.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.780]   Truth be told, you don't have to cleanse every day
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.180]   if your skin is otherwise fine and healthy
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.980]   and you're not bothered by anything.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.820]   You live a lifestyle in which you're not sweating excessively
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.260]   or producing a lot of sebum.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.340]   I, myself, same thing.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.620]   I work out, so I shower after working out,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.260]   and I usually shower before I get into bed
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.540]   because after a long day of work,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.880]   I tend to have things on my skin that shouldn't be there.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.100]   That's only fitting for me because if I don't,
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.220]   I tend to have problems.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.100]   I tend to break out.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.380]   I tend to have things that shouldn't happen
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.440]   because of my hygiene habits.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:20.780]   That said, there is no indication or no medical necessity
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.420]   to have to cleanse your skin even once a day.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.620]   Oftentimes, older patients cleanse or shower once a week,
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.380]   and they're totally fine,
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.080]   but it'll have to be defined by your skin
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.900]   and what problems or ailments are specific to you.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.860]   Generally, if you work out,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.780]   if you let sweat dry on your skin,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.260]   it causes several problems.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.620]   Number one is irritation itself from the salts
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.980]   that crystallize from the sweat drying off.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   Number two, the sweat itself is a source of food
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.340]   for certain yeasts that are normal symbiotic yeasts
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.500]   that live on our skin,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.380]   so it contributes to things like dandruff,
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.020]   what we call tinea versicolor,
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.260]   which is a type of yeast that grows on our skin.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.540]   So generally, if you work out,
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.980]   try to wash those things off.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.740]   Also, if you are one of acne-prone skin,
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.560]   if you're an adolescent, if you're a teenager,
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.820]   if you're an adult dealing with acne,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.360]   the sebum that your body's producing
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.900]   is food for the bacteria that cause this.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.900]   So you tend to want to clean some of that excess sebum off.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.520]   Those are simple indications
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.340]   to cleanse both your face and your body.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.420]   But if you're not having any problems,
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.000]   you actually don't need to do any of that.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.020]   In Europe, they shower and cleanse
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.500]   at a fraction of the frequency
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.020]   that we do in the United States.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.660]   And when you look at incidences
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.260]   of the most common skin conditions, they're the same.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.300]   - Including things like acne, psoriasis.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.840]   You know, most people think about
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.920]   shampooing for sake of hair,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.680]   but there's the scalp component.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.160]   And since you're an expert in skin,
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.080]   we should probably spend a bit of time on this.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.680]   For people that tend to have a dry or flaky scalp,
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.360]   what should they do about that?
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.440]   My understanding is that some of the more
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.660]   typical commercial anti-dandruff shampoos
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.720]   can contain things that might cause issues for hair itself.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.000]   So they might help with the flaking
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.160]   and drying of the scalp,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.860]   but damage other aspects of, you know,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.660]   either appearance or health of hair.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.180]   What are some really good options
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.700]   for people that have dry scalp?
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.660]   What are some great options
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.020]   for people that have oily scalp?
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.080]   And let's leave aside the frequency of use
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.660]   and just perhaps just put it on the shelf
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.180]   as much as you need it, but not more.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.060]   So that could be once a week, it could be daily.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.900]   Could be twice a day if in extreme cases, it sounds like.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.340]   - So when we think about the scalp,
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.520]   when we think about dry or flaky scalp,
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.100]   we think about two main conditions,
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.740]   either seborrheic dermatitis,
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.100]   which is medical grade dandruff,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.560]   or, or the medical name for dandruff, or psoriasis.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.820]   They're two different entities,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   but they generally contribute to the same problem,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.780]   which is redness, flaking, and dryness of the scalp.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.780]   Now, it's important to note
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.820]   that the hair on your head is dead.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.140]   It's not alive.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.900]   The only area that's alive
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.920]   is two and a half millimeters in the skin.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.080]   So the hair that we see on our scalp is not a living entity.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.940]   So there's a common misconception
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.780]   that you can affect the health or quality of your hair
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.700]   by putting things on the hair.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.500]   And I'll go into that in just a minute.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.340]   But the hair itself that you see is not living.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.980]   The only area that's living are the stem cells
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.860]   in the papilla of the hair,
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.580]   and in the bulge region of the hair,
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.140]   which reside in the skin.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.500]   So nothing that you put on your scalp
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.660]   will make you lose your hair,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.060]   will make you grow new hair for the most part.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.260]   Why that's important.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.700]   When we treat dry or flaky scalp,
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.220]   we treat it with several things.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.280]   The most common cause is an overgrowth of yeast
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   from the sweat and oil that is produced from our scalp.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.580]   And that's seborrheic dermatitis.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   That's the medical name for dandruff.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.940]   And so we treat it by, one,
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.980]   lowering the amount of that yeast that's living,
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.600]   and that's usually with shampoos that are prescription,
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.220]   or over-the-counter.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.260]   Things like zinc or ketoconazole shampoos
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.820]   are very common things.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.580]   And then the other thing that we do
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.700]   is to dampen the immune response
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.140]   to this overgrowth of yeast.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.460]   So the reason our skin flakes and gets red and proliferates
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.840]   is our immune system's responding to something.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.660]   It's either responding to the yeast
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.220]   or it's responding to itself,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.020]   which is what psoriasis is.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.240]   It's an immune-mediated overproliferation of skin cells
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.460]   because the immune system is overactive in the skin.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.240]   And the way we treat that is just topicals
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.840]   or certain medications that suppress
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.920]   the skin's immune system or immune activity.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.420]   None of that affect the actual hair itself.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:01.000]   What does happen is shampoos tend to have things
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.380]   that strip oils as a mechanism of cleaning.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.360]   So when you take a cross-section of the hair,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.800]   there are seven layers.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.360]   And the layer that provides that color, sheen,
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.040]   and structure is called the cuticle.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.880]   As we age, we lose the cuticle.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.760]   And that's a common problem,
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.040]   what we see in male and female pattern hair loss
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.200]   or androgenetic alopecia, is we lose that cuticle,
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   which makes us lose the shine and the structure
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.360]   and the strength of our hair.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.260]   Our body tries to replenish that with the oils.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.360]   So when people wash their hair,
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.640]   sometimes they feel like the hair becomes more limp
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.320]   or dull or lifeless.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.000]   It's because we've taken that artificial oil coating
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.080]   that replaced the cuticle and washed it off.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.400]   So good news is you're not gonna do any harm
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.140]   putting any of the topicals on your scalp.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.380]   Bad news is you probably won't bring a lot of it
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.440]   back to life either.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.920]   But when we treat flakiness, redness, things like that,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.440]   we're treating two entities, usually with topicals,
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.040]   and because we're either trying to treat
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.880]   overproliferation of something,
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.920]   or trying to calm down the skin's immune system.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   - Got it.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.480]   So it sounds like the best options for cleansing skin,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.680]   for shampooing, really stem from knowing
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.520]   whether or not your skin tends to air oily or dry,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.920]   figuring out how often to cleanse.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.240]   And then as you pointed out before,
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.040]   even though there's an enormous range of costs
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.360]   for these things, none of the solutions
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.440]   that you're describing sound like they fall
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.680]   on the high end of cost, or even in the middle end of cost,
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.440]   which is a bit surprising to me.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.560]   This might be one of the few areas where,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   like if I had a magic wand, I would make for all organic,
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:49.120]   non-processed and minimally processed foods
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.240]   to be very inexpensive.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.580]   But it turns out those things tend to be more expensive.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.780]   You can go to farmer's markets
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.200]   and cut back on the cost, et cetera.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.960]   But there seems to be an unfortunate trade-off
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.640]   between availability and cost and benefit,
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   or at least risk.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.120]   But it doesn't sound like that's the case
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.000]   with skincare or scalp care,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.660]   that one can exercise really excellent skin and scalp care
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.960]   without having to go into a range
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.480]   of spending an outrageous amount of money.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.160]   - No, I think, one, you're absolutely right.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.920]   The more expensive does not mean better.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.760]   In fact, they sometimes become more problematic
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.040]   because there's more ingredients
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.520]   in the more expensive products,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.920]   including elegant fragrances and stuff like that,
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.240]   which can be problematic.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.580]   That's number one.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.200]   The second thing to know is that,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.000]   generally speaking, there's some connection
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   between skin health, skincare, and this realm of beauty,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.560]   which people overlap a lot in.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.360]   And when we trend into this realm of beauty,
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   glamor, et cetera, price and objectivity are taken out.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.280]   And that's why you see a lot of skincare products
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.400]   that are so expensive,
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   because they draw towards another level of desire
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.160]   that's not just medical, it's aesthetic.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.400]   And that's where you'll find creams
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.720]   that are $200, $300 for a little amount of cream
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.400]   that does the same thing that your jar of petrolatum
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.960]   or Vaseline or Aquaphor does.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.120]   That part is really hard to mitigate.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.000]   But in general, almost everything that we as dermatologists
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.920]   and skin cancer surgeons and experts in the field recommend
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.000]   are really cheap, cost-effective,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.040]   and they have the least amount of ingredients in them.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.360]   And that's what I would recommend.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.720]   That's what I recommend for my family and for my patients.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.120]   You don't have to spend a lot to have excellent skincare,
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.480]   and you don't need to have it be a multi-step routine.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.200]   Oftentimes people overdo it.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.960]   The more steps that there are,
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.360]   there's more chances that something your skin
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   will respond to negatively.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.980]   The more chances you are to have a bad outcome
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.280]   to an ingredient of a product you're putting on your skin.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.980]   So keep it simple, keep it cheap, and you'll do great.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.320]   - It's going to be very reassuring to many people.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.940]   It's also going to be somewhat destabilizing
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.040]   to people who are really attached to the idea
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.960]   that the more expensive products are really doing something
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.600]   that much more beneficial for them.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.640]   - Not much at all, not anything.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.280]   Another important thing to consider
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.640]   when looking at skincare, skin health,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.620]   and then trending into that area of aesthetics and beauty
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.580]   is that most active ingredients,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:33.120]   if they're really active, tend to be controlled by the FDA.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.480]   So most things that are sold over the counter
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.560]   have actives that are not at a concentration high enough
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.440]   to be considered therapeutic,
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.200]   because that's when you get into the definition of a drug.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   So looking at things like anti-dandruff shampoos,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.520]   anti-aging creams, acne medications,
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.040]   they work a little bit.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.300]   If they work perfectly,
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.280]   then most medical dermatologists
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.960]   would be ahead of a lot of patients,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.460]   and we see a lot of skin disease that still continues
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.480]   because the active ingredients
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.200]   aren't at a concentration high enough
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.160]   to provide therapeutic benefit.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.460]   So save your money if you really need something
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.240]   to change some part of your skin,
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.840]   see a good dermatologist, see an expert,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.120]   and see what they can come up with.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.720]   - So this seems like an appropriate time
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.880]   to ask about sun exposure.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.440]   And then we'll also talk about sunscreen,
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.840]   sunblocks, skin cancer.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.680]   - Sure.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.120]   - But what is the relationship
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.560]   between sun exposure and skin health specifically,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:40.320]   meaning how much sun exposure is healthy for our skin?
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.200]   I'm a big believer in getting sun exposure to the eyes
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.160]   early in the day,
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.120]   blinking as needed to protect the eyes, of course,
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.600]   but in order to set one's circadian rhythm
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.880]   for elevated daytime mood, focus and alertness,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.000]   and improved nighttime sleep.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.960]   There's just so much data to support
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.840]   setting one's circadian rhythm properly for sake of health.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   And there's so much data to support the fact
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.280]   that sunlight viewing in particular
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.960]   is the best way to do that.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.680]   And sunlight viewing in the early part of the day
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.640]   in particular is the best way to do that.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.520]   But beyond that,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.480]   how much sun exposure to the skin is good for us?
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.440]   Is it zero?
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.600]   Is it five minutes?
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.560]   Does it depend?
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.120]   - Great, like great controversial question.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.640]   And it depends on which school of thought
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.600]   or camp you belong in.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.240]   As a skin cancer surgeon
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.800]   and somebody who's developed a reputation
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.780]   for seeing some of the worst,
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.300]   most complicated and life-threatening skin cancers
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.760]   in Los Angeles,
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.160]   obviously I see some of the consequences
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.380]   of long-term sun exposure and chronic photo aging.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.040]   That being said,
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.940]   I absolutely think that getting sun is healthy for us.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.120]   Now, why?
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   The studies that talk about vitamin D,
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.580]   and we'll touch on vitamin D as its own entity,
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.280]   and then overall health as another entity,
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.560]   but most of the studies that look at vitamin D synthesis
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.200]   from UV exposure on the skin
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.600]   suggest that you only need about 15 minutes
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.920]   and that you don't need a broad surface area of exposure.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.520]   You can get enough vitamin D formation
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.240]   with just about 15 to 20 minutes of sun on your forearms.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.560]   So there's a whole school of thought
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.800]   by a lot of experts who think
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.560]   there's no amount of UV exposure
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.000]   that's healthy for the skin.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.440]   And I tend to be on the other camp for several reasons.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   One, there is a component of feel-goodness
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.460]   if that's a word from being in the sun
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.460]   that affects overall skin and physical biology.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.160]   When you're out in a sunny day,
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.520]   you tend to be less stressed.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.880]   You tend to be a little happier.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.520]   Now, it's a generalization,
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.800]   but most of the time when you get outdoors,
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.160]   you get outside and it's a nice sunny day, you feel better.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.280]   And although you can't quantify that feeling better,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.000]   there are some parameters that can be measured.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.280]   Decreases in cortisol response,
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.660]   improvements in skin appearance and texture.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.400]   The other important thing about being out in the sun
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   is finding out your own tolerance, right?
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.480]   So I have a little bit more olive skin
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.800]   and I can tolerate the sun a little bit longer
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.200]   than somebody who is fairer and lighter eyes.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.480]   In my opinion, I don't think in most of the evidence,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.840]   there isn't a finite amount of time
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.440]   because that time is dictated by your skin's ability
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.560]   to tolerate the UV.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.280]   But I absolutely do not think that sun avoidance
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.400]   is a healthy thing.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.300]   And this is coming from somebody who operates
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.360]   on head and neck skin cancers literally every day.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.560]   I think there is a component of sun exposure
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.860]   that's not just for vitamin D synthesis,
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.680]   but something that improves your overall wellness
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   that is visible and maybe not laboratory measurable,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.800]   but you definitely are healthier
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.960]   when you're feeling better and you're happier.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.360]   I lived on the East Coast
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.840]   in places that had lower days of sun
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.880]   and I had seasonal affective disorder.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.720]   It bothered me.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.620]   My mood was lower.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.160]   I felt not as healthy.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.640]   I'd come home, my family would say,
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.840]   "Hey, you look sick."
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.240]   And it just, I wasn't sick.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.040]   I hadn't had any sun and I was lighter than I was.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.080]   And my family interpreted that as not being healthy.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.440]   My wife, on the other hand, didn't.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.700]   She didn't mind the grayness.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.040]   So there's a timeline for biologic processes
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.560]   like vitamin D formation that's helpful.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.920]   People can argue that you can get it
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.780]   through supplementation and food and that's correct,
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.700]   but there is a component of sun exposure
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.600]   that makes you feel better overall
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.960]   and provide some sort of wellness
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.700]   that you may not be able to quantify,
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:54.360]   but you see an appearance and in discussion and longevity.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.120]   So absolutely, I think you should be out in the sun.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.680]   I don't think you should burn
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.520]   and I don't think you should be out long enough
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.640]   where your skin starts to turn red.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.900]   That's the first sign that you're reaching
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.160]   kind of critical mass in terms of UV exposure,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.080]   but I absolutely think the sun is a good thing for us.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.480]   - So even midday sun,
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.300]   maybe if there's some cloud cover
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.180]   or if we have some sunscreen on or a physical barrier
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.420]   like sun and long, excuse me, like hat and long sleeves,
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.900]   then getting some sun exposure in your mind
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.520]   is good for our overall wellbeing, mood, et cetera.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.880]   - Yeah, I think, I mean, midday sun has a higher UV index,
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.400]   so you're more likely to burn
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.660]   and have a problem with prolonged exposure,
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.560]   but yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.480]   I think there's been numerous studies
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.320]   that have looked at people who go out for a walk
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   in busy urban cities in work environments.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.620]   If they go out for a walk in the sun, they feel better.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.920]   Their stress responses are lower,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.360]   their questionnaires in responding to life stressors
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.480]   and day-to-day stressors are decreased.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.920]   There's a lot of studies that look at being outside
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.880]   as a measure of wellbeing, mental health wellbeing
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.320]   is improved with outdoor sun exposure,
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.160]   so there's a lot of that.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.080]   Now, can I quantify it in the skin?
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.360]   Hard to say.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.880]   One thing we do know is that obviously
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   too much sun exposure, like anything,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.760]   too much of a good thing can be a bad thing,
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.200]   but I really do think that being out in the sun
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.040]   for the amount that your skin can tolerate is a good thing.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.120]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.440]   to thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.880]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.000]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.200]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.880]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.040]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.000]   about the critical importance of hydration
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.160]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.880]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.800]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.160]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.880]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.440]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.800]   are critical for the functioning
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.040]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.000]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.440]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.080]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.520]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.440]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.600]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.200]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.940]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:15.120]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.080]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.240]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.420]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.160]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.000]   spelled drinkelement.com/huberman,

[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.000]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.120]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.880]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.520]   - What about sunscreens and sunblocks?
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.100]   And I think we should distinguish between those two labels.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.520]   You know, in the old days, as I understand sunscreen
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.360]   was the word used to describe stuff
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.800]   that you put on your skin that absorbs UV
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.160]   and then sunblock is the stuff that you put on your skin
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.040]   to reflect UV.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.520]   Typically nowadays, people say sunscreen
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.840]   more than they say sunblock,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.160]   or they use them interchangeably
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.660]   without any knowledge of the underlying mechanism.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:10.400]   So first of all, let's clarify sunscreen versus sunblock.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.040]   - Yeah, so a lot of the nomenclature data,
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.620]   understanding chemicals,
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.720]   things that were considered okay to be used
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.320]   came from an original FDA 1999 manuscript.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:27.640]   And that data hadn't changed for almost 20 something years.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.480]   And more recently, in 2021,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.480]   the FDA released a proposed final order
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.900]   for the term sunscreens as a whole.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:41.320]   Now, when we talk about sunscreens,
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.800]   sunscreens are considered
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.180]   an over-the-counter non-prescription drug.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.200]   So they're regulated tightly by the FDA.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.640]   They're in the same category as any over-the-counter drug.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.280]   So before this decision ruling,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.440]   there was a lot of nomenclature, wording, confusion.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.400]   Sunblock seemed better than sunscreen,
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.200]   sun tan, sun tan oil.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   All of that's been changed recently
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.240]   or has been proposed to get rid of
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.820]   to unify the field and make it very clear what the goal is.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.240]   So no longer do we use the term sunblock,
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.760]   although in the past,
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.280]   that had been used for things like zinc
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.680]   or zinc and titanium-based creams,
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.920]   like the old 1980s or 1990s white lifeguard noses,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.860]   if you remember.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.700]   That used to be thought of sunblock,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:36.700]   whereas less protective chemicals were used as sunscreen.
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.800]   Now that's changing.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.000]   And the FDA 2021 proposed order says
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.180]   we need to unify everything and call it a sunscreen.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:49.960]   Now, sunscreens being regulated drugs
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.800]   take a lot of scrutiny for many reasons.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.320]   They take scrutiny from the FDA
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.120]   in terms of proving efficacy and safety.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.100]   They take a lot of scrutiny in society
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.880]   for being dangerous or not dangerous,
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.600]   effective or not effective,
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.840]   causing downstream effects
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.360]   or not causing downstream effects.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.620]   So that's been a big point of contention
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.640]   in terms of the population,
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.820]   the American Academy's stance, dermatologist's stance,
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.940]   and then the skin cancer patients' beliefs,
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.740]   the beauty experts' beliefs,
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.900]   and average person's opinions.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:30.220]   Sunscreens generally fall into creams,
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.220]   lotions, topical products
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.520]   that protect the skin against sunburn.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.740]   We used to be able to suggest
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.780]   that they reduce the risk of skin cancer,
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.340]   prevent it premature aging,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.820]   but that can be a little convoluted.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.020]   And the FDA is rewording that
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.860]   into not being able to say that anymore
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.740]   in their proposed order.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.680]   But what sunscreen's intention is
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.120]   is to protect the skin against excess UV exposure.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.380]   And they come in two flavors.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.980]   They come in mineral-based sunscreens,
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.020]   which tend to be in the category
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.020]   of zinc and titanium minerals.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.100]   And they tend to be chemical sunscreens,
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.060]   which are a bunch of different chemicals.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.620]   - Mineral-based sunscreens
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.300]   are sometimes called inorganic, correct?
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.220]   - Yeah, inorganic or physical sunscreens,
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.560]   whereas the chemicals are considered organic
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.380]   or chemical sunscreens.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.580]   Totally right.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.940]   - Is the mechanism for these two the same?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.180]   Because I was under the impression
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.380]   that the mineral-based inorganic sunscreens
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:32.180]   reflected back UV rays,
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:36.300]   whereas the chemical-based sunscreens absorbed UV rays.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.700]   But there's a bit of a online debate about this,
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.500]   claiming that they all absorb UV rays.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.900]   - Yeah, so historically it had been thought
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.060]   that mineral or physical sunscreens,
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.220]   zinc, zinc, and titanium sunscreens,
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.380]   worked by basically acting as a metal reflecting shield.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:59.340]   And for the most part, that thinking is not incorrect.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.780]   There was a new study that showed
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.500]   that they work by actually absorbing them,
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.100]   but not having any sort of chemical change.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.060]   So the way chemical organic sunscreens work
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.260]   is they absorb the ultraviolet radiation,
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.620]   they undergo a chemical reaction to reduce its energy
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.380]   and dissipate that energy as heat.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.420]   So chemical sunscreens work by actually absorbing it
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.260]   and undergoing a change,
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.300]   whereas mineral or physical sunscreens don't do that.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.220]   I still think of them simply as minerals
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   basically shield the skin like armor,
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.420]   whereas chemicals act as a sink
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.220]   and undergo a change to reduce that energy.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.420]   So that's kind of the simplistic way
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.420]   that topical sunscreens work.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.860]   - So what is your recommendation
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.580]   about protecting oneself from the sun?
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.420]   And maybe for the moment, let's just set aside sunscreens
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.700]   and acknowledge that a physical barrier
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.500]   like hat, long sleeves, long pants,
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.940]   provides a pretty good barrier to the sun, correct?
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.940]   - Yeah, in fact, physical barriers like shade, clothing,
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.940]   hats have been shown to be more effective
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:11.540]   than topical sunscreens for several reasons.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.300]   But there are many ways to protect your skin
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.820]   and you have to ask why you're protecting your skin.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:21.820]   So is it because you're worried about premature aging,
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:25.660]   photo damage and things like of that nature?
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.260]   Are you worried about your risk for skin cancer?
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.900]   Do you have a sun sensitive skin condition
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:35.860]   like lupus or PMLE that is sensitive to UV exposure?
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.620]   So the first question is, why are you worried?
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.260]   Or why are you taking protection?
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.980]   And then you customize your approach to that.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.980]   Now, sunscreen, topical sunscreens are not the only form.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.580]   By and large, there are many other forms,
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.540]   both physical blockers and certain things
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.980]   in the supplement world that can protect your skin.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.700]   For example, I myself take a product called sun powder
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.980]   that provides an internal sun shield
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.580]   and allows me to be in the sun longer
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.460]   without the need to reapply or if I can't reapply.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.860]   But by and large, the best way to protect your skin
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.660]   is some sort of shield, whether it's clothing, hat,
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.420]   or some sort of cream that you put on.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.100]   Now, for patients who are worried,
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.500]   or for people who are worried about premature aging,
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.860]   they don't have a strong family history of skin cancer.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.460]   They've never had one before themselves.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.020]   Then the approach to that is a little bit different
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.380]   than people who are worried about skin cancer development,
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.180]   strong family history of skin cancer.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.820]   They're worried about losing a part of their ear
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:45.580]   or a part of their nose to skin cancer development.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.180]   And that's very different from medical conditions
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.900]   that are very sun sensitive.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:54.900]   By and large, the patients who have medical conditions
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.100]   that are sun sensitive,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.340]   the large one being lupus, for example,
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.540]   need the most sun protection
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.820]   because they are so inherently sensitive to UV exposure.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.740]   Something that's very interesting.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:12.500]   We know without a doubt that every common skin cancer,
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.380]   there's many, many skin cancer types,
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.020]   but the three most common are basal cell carcinoma,
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.540]   squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.100]   Those are the three most common ones we see.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.500]   They have all been shown to have UV mutation signatures
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.060]   when we sequence the tumors.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.780]   However, in every single clinical trial
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.340]   and every single randomized trial
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.660]   that looked at topical sunscreens
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.340]   as a means of reducing risk,
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.500]   there has not been a single study
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   that showed any sort of risk reduction
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.060]   in the development of the most common skin cancer,
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.500]   which is basal cell carcinoma.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500]   One in four Americans will develop this.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.940]   Also, there hasn't been a single study to date
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.260]   that showed that diligent sunscreen use,
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.380]   topical sunscreens, will reduce disease-specific death
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.700]   or dying from skin cancer.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.140]   So if you think every skin cancer is sun driven,
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.060]   there are UV mutation profiles in these tumors,
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:13.740]   then by using sunscreen should reduce that, right?
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.220]   And it's not that clear.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:18.220]   We don't understand fully the drivers of this.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.300]   So why I bring this up
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.940]   and why we talk about sunscreens
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.660]   and barriers to blockade?
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.060]   First, topical sunscreens are not the only form.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.700]   In fact, clothing and shields, shade and hat
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.140]   are, in my opinion, better,
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.180]   and a lot of studies suggest that they're better.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.380]   There are oral supplements
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.260]   that can also protect your skin from burning
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.100]   and reduce your skin cancer risk.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.780]   And number three, not everything is sun driven.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.820]   We do know that diligent sunscreen use
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.500]   decreases the incidence
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.780]   or the amount of melanoma formation
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.140]   and squamous cell formation,
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.740]   but we still don't know whether that reduction
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.500]   has changed the number of patients dying from that.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.780]   We also know that it has no bearing
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.820]   in the development of the most common skin cancer,
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:03.700]   which is basal cell.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.620]   So we go back to the drawing board
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.540]   and scratch our heads saying,
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.500]   "Hey, what is the trigger?"
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.380]   The genetics loads the gun, for example,
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.820]   and maybe even pulls the hammer,
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:17.140]   but what in the environment is the trigger?
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.060]   Is it strictly UV?
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.700]   Is it some other culprit?
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.620]   So sunscreens are a really hotly debated topic.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.380]   So many things to talk about in terms of sunscreen.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.280]   - So if I understand correctly,
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.460]   you're saying that the use of sunscreen
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.940]   can protect against premature aging.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.100]   Let's say sunblock,
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.420]   because I think we're going to arrive
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.780]   at mineral-based sunscreens
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.380]   probably being the better option,
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.520]   but we can make sure that we double-click on that,
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.600]   so to speak.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.240]   But that sun exposure itself
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.360]   perhaps is not linked to the most deadly of skin cancers.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.740]   That tells me two things.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.640]   It doesn't tell me that I can just spend as much time
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.360]   as I want in the sun,
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.080]   but it does tell me that I should probably look
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.040]   into the things that cause the most deadly skin cancers.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:03.880]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.800]   But I'm also hearing that regular application of sunblock
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.980]   and/or physical barrier will protect my skin
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.560]   against some forms of premature aging
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.400]   caused by sun exposure,
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.380]   but will not necessarily protect me
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.840]   against the most common forms of skin cancer.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.320]   That is peculiar in the sense that,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   or even baffling to the non-dermatologist, me,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.560]   because we already know that sun exposure
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.120]   causes UV mutations.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.400]   Mutations in the DNA of cells
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.000]   is one of the kind of core components of cancer.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.200]   So how do we square all of this?
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.120]   - Great question.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.600]   And the more we dive into this
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.440]   and the more experts we look at
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.520]   and the more data we collect,
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.880]   the more we're scratching our head as to,
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.680]   we don't know, and why this occurs.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.960]   Now, I'm not saying don't use sunscreen.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.160]   Let's just let that be known.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.780]   I think sunscreens are excellent forms
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.760]   to protect against premature photo-aging
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.360]   and signs of sun damage.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.960]   I think sunscreens help reduce
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.560]   the incidence of common garden variety skin cancers,
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.760]   but they are not the only form of protection
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   and they seem to not be as important
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.160]   or have as much effect
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.640]   in reducing the incidence of our most common skin cancer,
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.260]   which is basal cell carcinoma.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.200]   Moreover, I would say,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.000]   and the data unfortunately shows
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.200]   that the majority of skin cancers
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   that we see that end up hurting people or killing patients
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.720]   don't arise in chronic sun-exposed areas to begin with.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.080]   I have a 27-year-old patient right now
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.520]   dying of a metastatic melanoma
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.920]   that arose in completely sun-protected skin.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.040]   I have a 56-year-old mechanic right now
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.960]   who's dying of a squamous cell carcinoma
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.600]   that arose from the back of his ear.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.160]   And most experts who have this type of experience
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   dealing with these patients have the same observation.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.360]   So the question is, what's pulling the trigger?
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.680]   For the most part, UV plays a big role.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.840]   The mechanism in which cancer forms,
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.120]   if we believe the basic high school biology is,
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.600]   you know, hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.120]   So there's a trajectory of changes that are occurring
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.320]   as a result of cumulative mutations in the skin.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320]   If we believe that trajectory,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.760]   then every skin cancer should see that change,
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.040]   and we just don't see that.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.560]   Also, we know that skin cancers that arise
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.820]   in sun-damaged skin behave differently
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.040]   than the ones that are very lethal.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.960]   So why I bring this up, I think sunscreen is very helpful,
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.800]   but we have this unfortunate trend in medicine,
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.880]   particularly in dermatology,
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.520]   to guilt people into thinking
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.120]   that they cause this to themselves.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.040]   And I don't think that's right nor okay,
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.680]   and I don't like that.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.440]   Because they make it seem that,
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.640]   oh, the sun you got in 1987,
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.960]   that one sunburn in Hawaii did it to you.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.200]   And that's absolutely not the case.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.460]   There are many things at play,
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.560]   fundamentally your genetics and immune system,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.080]   that play a huge role in skin cancer development
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.240]   that sunscreen cannot address and will not address.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   Now, the wild card is, okay, what are my genetics?
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.200]   And that's the part we don't know,
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.780]   which is why dermatologists say,
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.940]   okay, let's at least control the thing that we can,
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.920]   which is UV exposure.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.560]   But I bring this up because,
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.400]   don't feel bad about getting some sun,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.120]   and don't feel guilted into something that,
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.160]   if something bad occurs, it's not your fault.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.320]   Some of it is out of your control.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.000]   And that's really important,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.780]   'cause I see a lot of very bad skin cancers in my practice.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.960]   And I hate this feeling of patients
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.000]   feeling like they did it to themselves.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.360]   - I think most people would prefer
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.560]   not to have the premature aging caused by sun exposure.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.080]   So what should those people do?
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.040]   I've taken on a practice of putting a mineral-based,
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.520]   inorganic sunscreen on my face,
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.400]   my arms if they're going to be exposed,
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.240]   back of my neck, tops of my ears.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.440]   If I'm going to be out in midday or late day sun
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.860]   that feels intense,
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.700]   and I'll do that every single time I go out now.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.180]   On overcast days, not so much.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.840]   For viewing morning sunlight, I don't do that.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.520]   In fact, when the sun is low in the sky,
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.760]   I don't tend to wear sunblock.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.800]   That's me, that's been my choice.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.300]   There were a few years there where
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.240]   I didn't put on sunscreen,
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.880]   or if I did, it was like on a camping trip
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.280]   or skiing or something where the sun felt very intense.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.400]   And in that case, I would just reach
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.480]   for whatever sunscreen or sunblock was available
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.160]   because I wasn't aware that some of the ingredients
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.760]   in certain chemical-based sunscreens may be problematic.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.360]   So I think I fall into the typical category
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.500]   of a lot of people.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.760]   But of course, there's the category of people
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   that are like, nope, sunscreen sunblock
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.120]   is terrible all the time,
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.240]   or they're just too lazy or uninterested in applying it.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.880]   But then there's this whole category of people
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.300]   that are putting it on every single time they go outside
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.040]   in hopes that that's going to keep their skin
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.360]   appearing much younger,
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.720]   and just generally are kind of afraid of the sun.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.640]   - A lot of good points.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.420]   So there's that famous New England Journal of Medicine
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.200]   picture of the truck driver that got chronic sun exposure
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.280]   on the left side of his face,
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.880]   and you see all this wrinkling and modeling
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.040]   of the skin on the left side and nothing on the right side.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.000]   So by absolute measure, sun protection or UV protection
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.440]   will reduce premature aging.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.920]   Now, interestingly, that guy did not develop anything
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.760]   in that area.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.500]   So again, it goes back to, well,
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.160]   what's pulling the trigger? - No skin cancers.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.240]   - So the question is, what's pulling the trigger?
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.960]   Is it truly UV, or is there something else we're missing?
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.600]   - If you tell me that he got skin cancer
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.760]   on the opposite side, I'm really gonna gasp, but no.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.000]   - I don't know if he's had any on the opposite side,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.160]   but in that photo, it's purely premature aging.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.480]   So things that you wanna do.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.980]   Obviously, don't let your skin turn red.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:22.120]   Take some form of barrier protection,
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.640]   whether it's a sunscreen, a supplement like polypodium,
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.800]   something that protects your skin from the inside out.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.320]   And skin changes are cumulative.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.080]   So what we can tolerate in our teens and 20s
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.600]   is very different than what we can tolerate
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.840]   in our 40s, 50s, and 60s,
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.860]   because there's a cumulative mutation profile burden
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.400]   that we see.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.220]   Interestingly, there was an eyelid study
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:47.640]   that was published recently that looked at eyelid skin
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.680]   that was removed during cosmetic surgery,
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.960]   upper eyelid lifts, that was otherwise discarded.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.920]   And when they ran genetic sequencing on normal eyelid skin,
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.080]   they saw the same mutations that they would see
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.700]   in matched skin cancers,
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.180]   but the eyelids didn't have any skin cancer.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.860]   So we know UV triggers these mutations,
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.180]   and we know UV degrades collagen and elastin.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.200]   It thins blood vessel walls
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.100]   as a mechanism of its effects on the dermis.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:23.680]   The data is equivocal as to how those mutations
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.120]   trigger skin cancer formation,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.500]   but in terms of premature aging, absolutely.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.160]   So you wanna take some form of protection.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.060]   Now, what type of protection do you take?
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.580]   Depends on your genetics, how much you can tolerate,
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.160]   and what your family lineage looks like.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.360]   Some people have the genetics of early aging.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.480]   It's part of their skin biology,
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.520]   and you can't change that,
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.240]   but you can mitigate that risk
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.160]   with more strict UV avoidance.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.000]   Some people, they look young, longer.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.600]   Some family lineages just have great genetics in their skin.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.080]   They can tolerate a little bit more sun.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.400]   In terms of physical sunscreens versus chemical sunscreens,
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.520]   that's a hotly debated topic.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.680]   In my personal practice and for my family,
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.280]   I tend to only recommend mineral zinc
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.680]   or zinc and titanium sunscreens for several reasons.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.640]   In the original set of sunscreens
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.380]   that were approved by the FDA that came out in 1999,
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.380]   there wasn't enough data to look at biologic effects,
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.340]   efficacy, internal organ involvement, et cetera.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.360]   Fast forward 20 years,
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.560]   and we've gathered a lot more information
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.840]   about these chemical organic compounds.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.320]   There was an amazing 2020 study
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.680]   that looked at absorption of chemical sunscreens
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.440]   when they're applied onto the skin.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.720]   They looked at absorption with single application,
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.040]   and they looked at absorption over four days of application.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.580]   Now, in the study, they applied a little bit more
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.880]   than real world experience would,
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.480]   but even with single application,
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.640]   they saw blood plasma absorption of these chemicals
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.120]   that were 100 to 500 times greater
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.880]   than the upper threshold defined by the FDA.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.240]   Now, the question exists, okay, what does that mean?
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.360]   Is this healthy?
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.640]   Is this not healthy?
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.540]   Is it neither?
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.360]   That's still up for debate,
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.960]   but in looking at the more recent literature
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.040]   and looking at the chemical structure of these compounds,
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.920]   a lot of these are phenolic compounds,
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.480]   meaning they have one or two,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.280]   usually two benzene rings attached together,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.560]   and they look very similar to one another.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.360]   There's been a lot of basic science, animal study,
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.500]   and retrospective human studies
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.980]   in the last two or three years
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:53.760]   that suggest that some of these chemical compounds,
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.520]   particularly oxybenzone, particularly octocrylene,
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.880]   particularly octinoxinate,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.260]   that can have endocrine disruption
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.520]   or affect the nervous system
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.840]   because they mimic a lot of biologic phenolic compounds
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.120]   and a lot of biologic hormones.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.520]   If you actually look at the structure of oxybenzone,
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.320]   it looks very similar to the structure of bisphenol A,
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.560]   which has been now banned
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.440]   in a lot of the lining of plastic bottles.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.040]   Why? Because of the same concept.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.600]   Now, the data's not 100% one way or another,
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.200]   but there's enough smoldering evidence
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.800]   that makes me think, hmm, we should reinvestigate this.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.800]   And in fact, the FDA's proposed final order in 2021
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.800]   changed these chemicals from GRACE,
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.040]   generally recognized as safe and effective,
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.800]   to not-GRACE because of these concerns.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:50.120]   There's data that suggests that the chemicals
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.640]   are found in breast milk, amniotic fluid,
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.240]   blood plasma, urine.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   So there's a lot of things that we don't know,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.820]   and I always say this in science.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.880]   We take two steps forward
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.520]   and then maybe one step diagonally or sideways
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.000]   'cause we ran into unexpected things.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.320]   I tend to recommend mineral sunscreens
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.000]   because they don't have any of that data.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.200]   They haven't for the last 30, 40 years.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.260]   They're considered safe.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.840]   And in fact, for young kids,
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.900]   particularly those six months and under,
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.400]   the American Academy of Dermatology
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.240]   and the American Academy of Pediatrics
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.080]   generally recommends avoiding chemical sunscreens.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.240]   Why? Children's skin, particularly infants and toddlers,
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.840]   behaves more like mucous membranes than adult skin.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.000]   Their barrier is not as tightly woven,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.840]   so they absorb these things at a much higher concentration.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.000]   So if you are to apply something on kids,
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.320]   especially young kids six months or under,
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.960]   we recommend minerals to begin with.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.120]   So I say, if you have a pool of compounds
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.200]   that has maybe even smoldering evidence
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.160]   on the basic science level that something's off
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:58.160]   versus a group of compounds that have really no data,
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.760]   which one would you pick?
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.880]   And they do the same thing.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.760]   I naturally gravitate towards that.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:08.760]   - So the takeaway for me is physical barrier, no issues.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.960]   Mineral-based sunscreen, safest.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.080]   So that zinc oxide, titanium dioxide.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.080]   - And that's mineral, not like powder,
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.200]   not mineral powder, but mineral topicals
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.400]   because mineral powders are a whole other issue
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.720]   we'll talk about, but.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.840]   - Okay, and then chemical-based sunscreens,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.200]   probably best avoided.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.480]   And then you mentioned polypodium.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.800]   So this is a pill, it's a supplement basically
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.720]   that one can take.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.960]   I only call it a supplement
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.280]   because it's not a prescription drug, correct?
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.360]   - Yeah.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.600]   - That protects your skin from UV damage from the inside.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.680]   - Yeah, so exactly right.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.720]   Mineral-based creams and lotions,
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.320]   I tend to prefer and recommend in my practice
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.600]   and most people will if you're worried about any risk,
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.280]   any consequence.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.240]   Chemicals, I tend to personally avoid.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.380]   Now, this may not be in line
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.920]   with all my dermatology colleagues,
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.960]   but I tend to avoid them
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.720]   and I do not recommend them for kids.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.620]   In terms of things that you can do in addition
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.520]   to provide sun protection, polypodium's a fern
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.640]   from the Amazon rainforest that was discovered
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.760]   when they studied an indigenous population
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   that would eat this fern before they would go
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.480]   on their fishing expeditions on the Amazon.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.040]   And they'd be gone for three days,
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.080]   they'd eat this fern and come back not burned.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.160]   So a lot of studies were done on this fern
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.480]   in the last five, 10 years
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.760]   that showed it increases your skin's minimal erythema dose,
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.180]   the amount of redness your skin gets from UV exposure.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:48.460]   That's our general barometer for effectiveness
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.760]   without any topicals.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.480]   It's taken or ingested orally.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.960]   I personally use a form called sun powder
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.760]   that also has nicotinamide in it,
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.160]   and we can talk about nicotinamide later.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.400]   But if in and of itself, it works great,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.040]   in conjunction with topicals,
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.500]   you get the best of both worlds.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.000]   You get internal shielding and external shielding.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.480]   Now it is a supplement, so it's not a controlled drug
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.160]   the way the FDA regulates sunscreen.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.680]   So it isn't really a sunscreen,
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.300]   but it's a way to prevent sunburns,
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.840]   increase the amount of time you can be outside,
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.440]   and increase the efficacy of your topicals.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.080]   So if you're somebody who has very fair skin,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.760]   who burns all the time,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   or if you're somebody who has what we call sun hives
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.520]   or prickly sun rash, PMLE,
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.640]   this is an added thing that you can use
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.880]   that will boost your sun protective factors.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.720]   It's awesome.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.560]   And if you're somebody who's active,
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.920]   like you're in the water or you're exercising
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.880]   or you're playing a sport and you can't reapply,
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.060]   I love polypodium for that added benefit.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.880]   - What are the dosages of polypodium that are useful
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.440]   and are there any side effects?
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.320]   - Yeah, great question.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.000]   So there's been a wide variety of doses investigated,
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   anywhere from 50, 100, 240, 480, generally-
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.360]   - You said 1500?
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   - No, sorry, 50 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 240, 480.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:19.640]   Somewhere in the, between 50 and 480 milligrams
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.000]   is what's commonly used.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.920]   The most common side effect can be a little upset stomach
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.360]   if you can't tolerate the plant for whatever reason.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.240]   - It's taken daily?
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.560]   - It's taken, you can either take it daily
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.600]   as a method of preventing premature photoaging
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.760]   and pigmentary change,
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.280]   or you can take it as an as-needed,
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.680]   an hour before you get sun to shield you from the sun.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.840]   The other thing that it helps prevent
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.920]   that some sunscreens cannot,
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.680]   particularly the chemical sunscreens cannot,
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.680]   is the effects of visible light.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.760]   So there are certain skin conditions,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.040]   the most common is melasma,
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.320]   which a lot of women have,
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.100]   it's I think the bane of their existence.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.000]   It used to be called the mask of pregnancy.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.320]   And melasma is something that is very sensitive
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.720]   to both UV and visible light.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.240]   Chemical sunscreens don't do a good job
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.960]   blocking visible light.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.280]   Polypodium has been shown to help block
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.920]   the effects of visible light as well,
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.300]   which makes melasma worse.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.540]   It's this discoloration that we see mostly in women,
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.400]   usually after pregnancy or women who are on birth control.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.800]   It is really challenging to treat.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.500]   And sun protection is the first line,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.720]   like diligent sun protection.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.280]   But we found that supplementing with polypodium
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.600]   enhances this and makes patients' treatments more effective.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.660]   - Interesting, and you mentioned Sun Powder as a potential,
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.740]   that's a brand name?
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.160]   - So yes, Sun Powder is a brand.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.120]   It's a product that I helped formulate
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.480]   with one of my colleagues over at Harvard,
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.400]   who's a laser and aesthetic dermatologist
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.240]   to Harvard trained.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.080]   And this is something that we came up with
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.320]   when I was up at Stanford.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.440]   And it's a supplement dedicated to skin health,
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.600]   and it does two things.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.560]   I take it daily myself as a single scoop.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.840]   It helps reduce your skin cancer risk,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.320]   your non-melanoma skin cancer risk by up to 30%.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.000]   And the data was published
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.520]   in the New England Journal of Medicine
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.120]   in a phase three randomized trial
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.200]   for one of the ingredients.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.160]   The other ingredient, obviously, is polypodium.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.600]   And I take that one to prevent sun-related changes,
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.520]   but also help reduce my risk of burning.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.980]   Often when I personally find the need for sunscreen,
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.280]   it's when I can't apply.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.120]   I'm always at the water, I'm swimming.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.120]   My son, he's seven, he races on a swim team.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.300]   I cannot get this kid to reapply sunscreen.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.640]   So this is a supplement that I give him.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.600]   And it took us several years of formulation and testing,
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.280]   including MED testing,
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.900]   which is minimal erythema dose testing to come up with.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.160]   It's easy over the counter,
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.240]   and it's one of many supplements that contain polypodium.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.560]   I just like it 'cause it's a single scoop
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.320]   and I mix it into my morning drink and I'm done.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.160]   Terrific.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.080]   - I think we both agree that the mineral-based sunscreens
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.560]   are going to be the best option of the ones out there,
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.700]   if one is at all concerned about some of these chemical
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.800]   components in chemical sunscreens.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.640]   - Yeah. - Absolutely.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.760]   - Fair enough. - Absolutely agree.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.600]   - Yeah, so within that category,
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.840]   are there particular things to look for?
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.520]   I'm not necessarily trying to aim
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.920]   for particular brands here,
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.800]   but given that I have no relationship
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.580]   to any skincare products,
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.640]   I would just like to know which ones to look for,
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.000]   or will any zinc oxide and or titanium dioxide
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.240]   containing sunscreen,
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.360]   provided there are no chemical components in there,
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.060]   besides the inactive ingredients, of course,
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.480]   will any suffice?
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.600]   Because in that case,
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.840]   people can just shop for cost or availability.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.120]   - Yeah, so I tend to take a pragmatic approach in this.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.460]   My recommendation is a brand that you will use,
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.560]   because if I recommend a brand and you don't like it,
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.800]   it doesn't feel good or smell good,
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:26:59.680]   you're never gonna use it
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.320]   and it's a waste of your money and time.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.320]   So number one, any brand that is mineral-based is fine.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.720]   What you're looking for is broad spectrum coverage,
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.360]   which almost all mineral-based sunscreens provide.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.560]   Broad spectrum meaning UVA and UVB.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.520]   And we know these two UV forms
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.560]   do different things in the skin.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.240]   We know that UVB is more implicated in redness
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.540]   and some early skin cancer changes.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.540]   We know UVA is linked to premature photo aging
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.240]   and certain melanomas.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.600]   So you want something that provides broad spectrum coverage.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.440]   You're looking for a number, the SPF we talk about.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.800]   You're looking for a number above 30.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.040]   Why 30?
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.760]   Because every study that looked at defining the SPF
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.800]   required you to put a certain amount on the skin.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.680]   Generally, it's an entire shot glass worth of the product
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.880]   on sun exposed skin.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.760]   Most of the time in real world practice,
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.040]   people don't put on that much.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.440]   They put on maybe half that.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.480]   So what you're really getting when you buy something
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   that's SPF 15 is like an SPF of eight.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.720]   So if you're looking for something
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.980]   that provides protection, SPF 30 or greater is higher.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.860]   Higher the zinc concentration,
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:11.060]   the better it protects against UV invisible light.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.620]   The chalkier it may go on.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.900]   So that's kind of where you find that balance.
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.920]   That's actually where the chemical sunscreens came about
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.220]   is the cosmeceutical industry finding things
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.440]   that felt nicer on the skin
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.360]   so that people could put makeup on
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.520]   without that grainy chalkiness.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:30.000]   But in doing so, we ran into some issues.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.080]   - What are some, if any, of the concerns
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.520]   that some of the components in chemical-based sunscreens
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.320]   can cross the blood-brain barrier?
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.300]   - It's not unjustified to think that.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:47.160]   They are organic phenolic compounds.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.080]   They are hydrophobic, they're lipophilic,
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.480]   meaning they can cross membranes very easily,
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.320]   which is why they run into this endocrine disruption
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:01.860]   and some nervous system dysregulation.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:05.740]   Whether that's been validated to be problematic in humans
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.320]   has yet to be seen, but at least in vitro studies
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.360]   in certain animal models, we see this.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.620]   So when you apply a certain concentration,
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.520]   and with that 2020 study that showed
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.720]   that we're seeing it in the blood
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.720]   at levels that are 200 to 500 times the upper limit
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.800]   of normal as defined by sunscreen criteria,
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.920]   now we have to scratch our head.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.200]   Where is this circulating?
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.080]   Where is this going?
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.240]   Are we collecting it in our adipose tissue?
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.480]   If we're collecting it there,
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.920]   we may be collecting it up here.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.640]   We may be collecting it in the nerves.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.280]   So it's a really fascinating world
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.840]   to see where we're going with these.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.040]   And in fact, the 16 most common chemicals
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.960]   that in '99 were everywhere, from spray sunscreens
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.400]   and bottles and things like that,
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.640]   are now being defied as, hmm, question mark,
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.120]   maybe not safe by the FDA,
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.440]   the very company that regulates it.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.720]   - Another call for the mineral-based sunscreens
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.800]   just as a, you know, why take the risk?
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.040]   - Or even, you know, shade hat clothing.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.080]   You know, if you're really worried
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.880]   about putting something on in absorption,
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.400]   you get excellent protection by natural barriers.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.520]   - This seems like a good time to shift
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.640]   a little bit of our attention to nutrition
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.320]   and the gut microbiome.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.320]   Now, this is an infinitely large topic.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.480]   We could spend several episodes discussing this,
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.520]   but if you were to provide us some of the,
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.000]   kind of like major takeaways
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.240]   as it relates to nutrition and skin health,
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.560]   nutrition and skin appearance,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.160]   gut and skin health and appearance, what would those be?
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.480]   - So there is an incredible connection
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.560]   between the gut microbiome and skin health
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.920]   and the skin microbiome,
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.360]   of which we're only now just understanding the gravity,
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.760]   the extent, and the connection.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.480]   We know from many studies, many elegant studies,
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.360]   a lot of studies done out of my colleagues' labs
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.920]   up at Stanford, that modulating the gut microbiome
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.480]   affects inflammatory conditions of the skin.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.920]   Meaning, if you control the dysregulation
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.360]   of the gut microbiome,
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   if you have an anti-inflammatory dietary habit,
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.360]   actual skin disease decreases in intensity and severity,
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.760]   psoriasis, eczema, acne.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.560]   And this is not just subjectively,
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.000]   it's measurable and quantifiable and reproducible.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.280]   So the connection is fascinating.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.720]   Now, how we modulate it, that's the unknown.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.520]   We know in many different studies
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.040]   that some patients' gut microbiomes are wildly fluctuant
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.440]   to what they do from their environment
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.560]   in terms of dietary habits, antibiotics, things like that.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.280]   Some people's gut microbiomes are rock solid,
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.160]   nothing changes them.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.200]   And deciphering whose will benefit from what
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.240]   is the hardest part.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.200]   In terms of nutrition overall,
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.480]   obviously everybody's told you this
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.360]   since the dawn of modern medicine,
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.400]   is a well-balanced diet is good for everything.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.800]   Unfortunately, in the 21st century,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.320]   there are a lot of diets.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.760]   There are a lot of fad diets,
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.320]   there are a lot of restrictive diets.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.160]   And that's where we see nutrition play an important role
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.640]   in both appearance and actual skin disease health.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.960]   And there's so many different avenues to discuss this.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.000]   Things like dietary habits and changes for acne.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.200]   Things like dietary habits and changes for anti-aging.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.600]   Things like dietary habits for rash disorders
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.960]   like psoriasis and eczema.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.440]   It's so much to explore.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.120]   - So my understanding, and we'll get into this more
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.000]   as it relates to acne, is that patterns of eating,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.540]   either content, food volume, that is caloric load, et cetera,
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:59.200]   that increase insulin and things like mTOR
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.080]   are sort of pro-acne.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.640]   They're gonna aggravate or increase acne.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.680]   Whereas the things that tend to lower
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.520]   circulating blood glucose, insulin,
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.040]   and reduce inflammation tend to be kind of anti-acne,
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   or sort of pull in the other direction
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:18.540]   towards reducing acne load.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.960]   But if we were to just step back and say,
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.220]   okay, the typical person who wants to have
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.840]   the healthiest, best-appearing skin,
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.760]   who's not dealing with any specific issue,
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.080]   'cause we will get into those specific issues,
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.340]   can we say they should eat a vegan diet, a vegetarian diet,
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.080]   is it okay to be an omnivore?
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.400]   Some people are on the extreme
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.720]   of this kind of carnivore-type diet.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.480]   Some of those people actually report
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.860]   elimination of certain skin conditions.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:49.080]   I don't know, I've never tried one of those extreme diets,
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.320]   but you hear this, but again, you hear a lot of things.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.380]   So it seems to me that the relationship
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:59.200]   between keeping the gut microbiome healthy
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.520]   and ingesting sufficient amounts of fiber is pretty clear.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.240]   The relationship between keeping the gut microbiome healthy
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.820]   and overall, that is, systemic inflammation low
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.120]   is pretty clear, and that eating foods
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.640]   that are mostly unprocessed or minimally processed
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.440]   keeps inflammation on the lower side,
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.400]   as opposed to eating more processed foods.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.800]   But, you know, assuming you,
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.280]   would you agree or disagree with me on that?
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.520]   Feel free to disagree, please, yeah.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.080]   So assuming that that's all true,
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.500]   is there any evidence that the ingestion of specific foods
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.680]   can make skin healthier?
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.480]   Like, you'll see this stuff, like, oh, you know,
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.800]   if you have two cups of blueberries a day,
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.320]   your skin is going to be healthier.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.100]   Or is all of that indirect by virtue
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:44.160]   of specific micronutrients that are in those foods?
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.480]   - So there's a lot of layers to unravel on this.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.800]   So if you're gonna pick one simple diet
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.800]   for optimal skin health,
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.120]   it's a high-protein, anti-inflammatory diet.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.480]   So high-protein, animal-sourced proteins,
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.700]   fruits and vegetables,
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.940]   based on your ability to tolerate the fibers
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.780]   in the fruits and vegetables.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.980]   Things that are inflammatory are inflammatory
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:09.820]   for two reasons.
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.840]   One, the glucose-insulin pathway,
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.860]   but number two, the bacteria in our gut process
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.500]   and release byproducts of metabolism of certain things.
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:23.460]   And those byproducts, basically their digestive products,
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:25.300]   can be very pro-inflammatory.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.140]   So often you hear these anecdotal stories
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.800]   of I eliminated tomatoes and my psoriasis got better.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.160]   That person may have had an inability to tolerate tomatoes
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.880]   because of their gut microbiome's ability
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.240]   to digest the lycopene or whatever it is.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:44.600]   We do know for certain that anti-inflammatory diets
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.000]   do improve skin health that are measurable
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.560]   and seen in clinic.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   So absolutely high-protein, a complete protein.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.640]   When I say complete protein,
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.180]   tends to be animal-based products, eggs, meat, chicken, fish,
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:03.300]   less so plant proteins just because of bioavailability
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:06.820]   and complete amino acid profiles.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.940]   You want a high-protein, anti-inflammatory diet.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.500]   That's number one.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.060]   In terms of what you can introduce to your skin
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:18.060]   to improve one or two parameters,
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.780]   I don't think that's real.
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.940]   Why I bring this up, we see a lot of talk
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.440]   and you've had a lot of people discuss collagen,
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.720]   for example, and this is an incredibly popular product
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.880]   in the skin world because its claim to fame
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.760]   is it does everything, keeps you looking young,
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.680]   keeps your skin healthy, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.680]   Well, we know collagen is essential to our skin health.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.560]   Literally, it's what our dermis is made of
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.920]   that give us our suppleness, our youth, no wrinkles,
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.040]   you know, things like that.
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.740]   Collagen is made of three amino acids,
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:56.700]   glycine, proline, and usually hydroxyproline
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.780]   or hydroxyl lysine, okay?
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.060]   Those three amino acids are non-essential amino acids,
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:05.740]   meaning your body has the ability to synthesize these
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.680]   from sugars and fats that it eats.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.440]   So collagen supplementation is not an essential protein,
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   unlike animal proteins, which provide all 20 amino acids,
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.980]   including the essential ones your body cannot synthesize.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.620]   Now, you may ask, okay, well, I see all these studies
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.860]   that suggest collagen supplementation
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:28.980]   improves skin health, skin appearance.
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.160]   There's several reasons for that.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.400]   I don't think it doesn't.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.060]   I think there is some benefit.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:37.600]   The question is what are the confounding variables to this?
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.060]   Were the people in the studies on restrictive diets
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.800]   because they were thinking about beauty and aesthetic?
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.440]   Were they restricting patterns of food, dietary food,
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.300]   things like that, in which they weren't getting
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:54.540]   a sufficient amount of protein source to begin with?
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.620]   So when they supplemented,
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.700]   we saw improvements in their skin.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:01.700]   And a lot of these studies are patient recall
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.020]   or patient questionnaire studies,
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:05.060]   in which there is inherent subjectivity
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.900]   and confounding variables in this.
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.180]   When people take an intervention that says,
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.220]   hey, you may look better,
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.420]   or this may improve the appearance of your skin,
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.780]   not only do you have a placebo effect in saying,
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.680]   yeah, I do look better,
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.700]   you may also do other things during your day,
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.240]   change your behaviors and lifestyle
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.340]   to fit the goal that you subconsciously want.
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.280]   So that's one.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:30.020]   Number two, there is a component in,
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.260]   for example, collagen supplementation
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.580]   that is forgotten about quite a bit.
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:37.380]   And that's the increase in blood osmolality.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.660]   And I learned this in the fitness world.
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.140]   I was really big into fitness in college,
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.820]   and it was my escape from life stressors.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.740]   And we found that people who supplemented
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.300]   with any powdered protein source,
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.540]   it doesn't matter collagen, albumin, whey,
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:54.380]   and more so with people who supplement with creatine,
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:58.520]   that there is an increase in blood or plasma osmolality.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.060]   So the solute concentration increase in the blood,
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.620]   which draws water in.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.300]   That's predominantly how things like creatine
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:05.520]   make you look bigger.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.120]   And I know we're going a little bit on a tangent,
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:10.340]   but one of the reasons the way collagen works
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.460]   is your blood osmolality increases,
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.360]   you draw a little bit more water into the vessels,
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.080]   which plumps up the appearance of the skin.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.500]   So there is a hydration component from the water draw,
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.660]   and this is measurable.
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.220]   You can draw a patient's blood
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:27.980]   after consuming collagen protein, whey protein,
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:31.300]   and see this spike in plasma protein.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.800]   So there's that component as well,
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.140]   which is not truly a benefit,
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.020]   but it's an aesthetic benefit.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:40.260]   Why that tends to be a problem
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.300]   is sometimes people supplement with collagen
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.060]   end up actually having high blood pressure
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:45.860]   and they're otherwise healthy.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.600]   And this was something that we saw
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.120]   in the fitness world a lot,
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.040]   is that young college athletes,
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.860]   high school athletes that would come in,
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.680]   they would otherwise be completely healthy
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.240]   and would be running high blood pressures.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.840]   If you took away their protein and creatine supplementation,
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.320]   their blood pressures dropped.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.160]   - Interesting.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.240]   - And it's really fascinating stuff.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.720]   And I used to work out at UCLA
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.920]   with one of the professors of Phi Psi,
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.960]   who was a really big dude.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.760]   And we worked out together and we did all these studies
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.740]   and looked at young, otherwise healthy people.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.880]   So that's one component.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:21.480]   The other question is,
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.480]   do any of these food changes
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   actually quantifiably increase skin collagen density,
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.920]   skin elastin density?
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.440]   There's no evidence that taking these things will traffic,
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:41.200]   or meaning will go to where you want them to.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.520]   It's kind of silly to think if I drink this,
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.660]   it's gonna go into my stomach, go into my intestine,
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:49.700]   be absorbed and then know to go exactly to my cheek.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.580]   Usually it doesn't occur that way.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:54.540]   And when we've looked at histologic comparison studies,
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:56.300]   the data is equivocal.
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.420]   Some studies have shown a slightly increase
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.020]   in collagen density and you wonder,
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.220]   are those patients one that are on restrictive diets
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.440]   to begin with?
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.180]   And then there are some studies that have shown
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:09.180]   there's really no density change in collagen and elastin.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.400]   So the supplements really don't actually make
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.340]   a physical difference.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.640]   Now the other question is, is that study too short of term?
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.880]   How long do you stay on these?
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.560]   Data is wild and there's a lot to understand,
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.520]   but we do know high protein, complete proteins,
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.400]   anti-inflammatory diets, absolutely critical for skin health.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.640]   - I guess the most direct question is,
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.820]   do you yourself consume collagen proteins
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.080]   in a supplement form or make it a point to eat things
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.800]   like bone broth, which contain high percentages of collagen?
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.040]   - Great question.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.780]   I do supplement only in sun powder,
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.060]   which is my daily supplement.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.900]   It contains bioactive collagen peptides.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.700]   Aside from that, I think natural sources are better.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:53.780]   So my wife cooks a lot at home, bone broth,
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:57.440]   beef bone broth, chicken bone broth, a lot of animal meats.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.980]   My diet tends to be more in the, I guess old school,
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.940]   you'd call it Atkins or keto diet,
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.660]   where I eat a lot of proteins
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.660]   and mostly fruits and vegetables.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.960]   I'm not very restrictive,
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.980]   but I know that's what's made the biggest difference.
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.840]   I know that if I go on a sugar binge in a few days,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.140]   I'm breaking out, it's like clockwork for me.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.620]   Some people are not as sensitive, my body is,
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.700]   and that's where the personalized medicine comes in.
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.860]   - Is there a role for omega-3 fatty acids like fish oils
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.660]   and things of that sort for skin health specifically?
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.740]   - Yes and no.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:36.160]   Yes, there is some evidence that omega-3 supplementation
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:41.160]   and tends to be better in fish form than non-fish formats,
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.100]   but omega-3s tend to be anti-inflammatory.
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.860]   So there's an improvement in skin health because of that.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.480]   One thing we do see is they thin the blood.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.400]   So people tend to bruise a little bit more.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.700]   So actually in my practice,
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.580]   I have people stop omega-3s before any sort of surgery
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.240]   because they bleed more.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.980]   - What about some treatments that are known to be beneficial
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:03.380]   for the appearance and health of skin
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:06.620]   that people are not as aware of, right?
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.860]   Because I think people who are concerned
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:10.300]   with their skin health and appearance,
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.500]   they think about sunscreen
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.540]   and we've learned a lot about that from you,
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.400]   but what are some things that really work
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.620]   to improve skin health and appearance
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.760]   that perhaps require a visit to the dermatologist,
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.700]   but that you don't hear enough about?
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:26.940]   - Yeah, so two big categories.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.140]   So we know the skin turns over, right?
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.040]   It turns over every 28 days.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.960]   So in theory, if you keep turning the skin over,
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.880]   you can get rid of those mutations that occur
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.340]   in the skin that's stacking up
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:42.920]   and hope to bring out more vital, youthful skin
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.960]   that's not just appearing vital,
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.800]   but actually biologically healthier.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.000]   And there's two categories of things you can do.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.040]   The first is the family of retinoids.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:57.120]   Amazing medications, amazing drugs,
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.100]   been around for 50 years.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.500]   They come in oral form and topical form.
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:08.500]   And these increase the time or they shorten the time,
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:11.840]   they increase the skin turnover from 28 days
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.360]   to somewhere between seven to nine days.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.680]   And in doing so, they've been shown
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.560]   to decrease skin cancer and pre-cancer formation.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:22.640]   They've been actually shown to grow new collagen.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.320]   They've been shown to increase elastin and appearance.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.880]   And this has been histologically verified
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:29.280]   in study after study,
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:32.160]   meaning we take a biopsy of the skin,
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.560]   have them start a prescription retinoid,
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.800]   re-biopsy the skin and stain it for collagen or elastin,
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.660]   and you see a marked improvement.
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:44.660]   It's every dermatologist's well-known tool.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.120]   And for some reason,
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.120]   it's still not well-known in the population.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.800]   Its original indication was for acne
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.580]   and still is first line for acne,
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.880]   because what it does is it dries out the oil glands.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.120]   But in doing so, it also helps repair skin.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.680]   So I recommend every single person
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.280]   to be on a prescription-strength retinoid,
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.120]   which is different than over-the-counter retinol.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.040]   And there's a lot of confusion,
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.920]   and I think the confusion is intentional
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.440]   in the cosmeceutical world as to why this is,
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.240]   but everybody should be on a prescription-strength retinoid.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.800]   Usually topicals is all you need.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.240]   The most common are things like tretinoin,
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.560]   adapalene, or tazerotine.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.000]   And there's oral forms.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.200]   The most common is Accutane or Isotretinoin,
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:35.200]   and to a lesser-known drug called Acetretin or Seriatane.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.280]   And I usually reserve that
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.140]   for my high sun damage skin cancer patients.
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.140]   It really makes a difference.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:46.720]   But I'm gonna touch back about retinol versus retinoids.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.000]   So many, many years, we studied retinoids.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.160]   The way retinoids work is they're actually,
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.080]   and they activate transcription factors,
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.620]   they're nuclear messaging hormones.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:02.040]   So these compounds bind retinoic acid receptors,
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.620]   and they activate the transcription of certain genes.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:09.920]   One of the genes we know that it can affect
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.680]   is the sonic hedgehog pathway
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.840]   and some of the embryologic genes.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.000]   Why that's important is when we first studied retinoids
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.460]   in oral or cream version,
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:23.760]   we noticed that these can affect the development of a fetus,
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.320]   and they can be passed through breast milk
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.160]   and through sperm or semen.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:34.160]   So because of this issue, the FDA regulated it very tightly.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.080]   And it's pretty regulated worldwide
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.160]   because the effects are devastating,
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.680]   missing arms, missing legs type of birth defects.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.680]   Because the medication was so effective
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.400]   and we saw an improvement in both quality
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.440]   and appearance of skin,
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.320]   the cosmeceutical beauty world said,
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.500]   oh, okay, this is awesome.
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.080]   We need to figure out a way to get this on the shelf,
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.580]   but not be a prescription.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.180]   Out came retinols with an OL,
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:03.340]   which is the inactive version of retinoic acid,
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.060]   which is retinoids.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:09.060]   And what has to happen is retinol needs to be converted
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:14.060]   in a two-step process to become active retinoic acid.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:17.220]   Otherwise, it's a completely inactive prodrug,
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:19.260]   which is sold over the counter
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.180]   at concentrations that are not biologically active.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.380]   That's how cosmeceutical companies can get away
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:29.260]   with prescribing this for people of childbearing age.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:31.780]   In my opinion, if you want a retinoid,
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.140]   get a prescription for it.
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.620]   The over-the-counter stuff is not very effective,
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:36.540]   if at all.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:40.060]   The shelf stability, many studies have shown
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.900]   that almost all retinoids over-the-counter,
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:44.500]   retinols over-the-counter
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:48.180]   are basically unstabilized by one year.
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.260]   So you don't even know what you're paying for.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.700]   The prescription is easy to get.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:53.220]   You can see pretty much any dermatologist,
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:55.980]   and it's the only version that's truly effective.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.420]   So everybody should be on it.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.900]   Protects your skin, keeps you looking young,
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.940]   reduces skin cancer risk, grows new collagen.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.260]   Literally the only consequence is that when you first start,
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.260]   your skin may be a little bit red or peely
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.180]   as the skin acclimates or turns over.
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:12.260]   Other than that, nothing.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:15.860]   - Why do you think, given the immense interest
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.900]   in skin appearance and health,
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.700]   that we don't hear more about this?
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:23.460]   - Because, that's a great question.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.340]   So we hear so much about retinol.
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.380]   Every magazine you open that has anything,
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.340]   you'll see like intensive night cream,
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:34.700]   intensive eye serum, regenerist eye repair,
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:36.300]   and all of them have retinol.
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.020]   None of them have retinoid or tretinoin for many reasons.
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.300]   Originally it was made for acne.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.620]   And the patients that came in to get them for acne
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.340]   were not necessarily in the same line of thought
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.900]   of premature aging and longevity.
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.500]   - This would be things like Retin-A.
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:54.500]   - Yeah, Retin-A, exactly, or Accutane, or Differin.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.140]   These are the brand names for these products.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:58.140]   So there was a disconnect between the people
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.420]   seeking the anti-aging effects
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:04.060]   and the people getting it as a prescription.
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:04.900]   That's one.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:07.980]   And number two, as soon as cosmeceutical companies
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.340]   figured out a way to market
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:12.660]   over-the-counter inactive versions, that went haywire.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:15.580]   So you can Google retinol and there's a million things.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.940]   When you Google tretinoin, you only hear about acne.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.260]   So there's a little bit of a disconnect,
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.460]   much like all in medicine,
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.020]   between what docs know and think the population knows
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.420]   and what the population actually knows.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:27.300]   But that's the one thing I think
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:29.060]   we've been doing a great job on
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:30.300]   in modern day social media
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:32.420]   is advocating for these medicines.
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:36.140]   Now, that's one realm of things that you can do
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.660]   to absolutely improve the quality of your skin,
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.300]   long-term health, appearance,
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:44.220]   actually revitalize the skin.
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:48.540]   Then there's a whole set of procedures that can be done
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.060]   that have been shown to improve not only the appearance,
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:53.220]   but actual biologic health.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.660]   So that's where we fall into the laser world.
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:59.820]   And somebody who's been in photobiology,
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.660]   albeit a slightly different realm,
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:03.500]   you know the effects of light
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:07.700]   and the incredible changes that it can have in biology.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.780]   Most of what we understand for lasers in medicine
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:13.820]   came out of dermatology studies.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:16.500]   A lot of the understanding of laser biology
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.900]   came out of the Wellman Institute over at Harvard,
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.020]   where many of my colleagues are.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:25.340]   And we now know that certain laser devices,
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.500]   certain resurfacing devices,
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.060]   not only improve the appearance of your skin,
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.900]   clinically, they reduce your risk of skin cancer
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:36.340]   by 20%, maybe greater.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:39.380]   And even more amazingly,
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:42.260]   is when you do microarray gene studies,
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:44.860]   they actually activate the genes
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:46.900]   of more youthful, healthy skin cells
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.460]   that were quiescent as we age.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:53.180]   So there's genetic verification, clinical verification,
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:54.540]   and aesthetic verification.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.620]   These things are awesome.
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:58.660]   Now, laser is a big umbrella term.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:00.900]   Some of the devices we use are not lasers.
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.220]   They're actually light, broadband light,
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:05.380]   or intense pulse light.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.620]   Some of them are lasers.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:08.780]   Some of them are ablative.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.980]   Some of them are non-ablative.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.980]   And we get into the nuances of these things,
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.260]   but there are a few lasers
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:17.180]   that have been shown to make these dramatic differences.
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.940]   So if you're interested, I mean, see an expert.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.260]   - So this would be go to your dermatologist,
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:26.220]   ask for some, is it laser resurfacing?
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:27.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.100]   So laser resurfacing, it tends to be,
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:30.940]   and what's really popular,
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.900]   there's two forms of laser resurfacing.
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:34.460]   There's what we call non-ablative,
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:38.420]   meaning it doesn't burn or vaporize the top layer of skin.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.380]   And then there's ablative resurfacing,
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:42.660]   which vaporizes the top layer of skin.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:46.060]   Obviously, ablative ones are much more aggressive,
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:48.500]   much more effective, a lot more downtime,
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:49.460]   and a lot riskier,
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.460]   because you're literally peeling the face off
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.260]   or any part of the body.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.860]   And it regrows without any scarring.
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:56.900]   That's also another beauty of the skin
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:58.900]   is you can literally peel it off entirely
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:01.140]   and have it regrow as if nothing ever happened.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:03.100]   - So people have this done once a year or so?
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.460]   - Yeah, for ablative resurfacing,
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:08.980]   it's like once every five years or so on.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.380]   It's pretty dramatic.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:12.500]   - And how long is the downtime?
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:16.500]   - For ablative resurfacing, two weeks.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.540]   Usually two weeks, you're pretty raw and sore.
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:21.100]   It's fallen out of favor in most big cities
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:22.980]   because of the downtime and the inherent risks,
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:25.020]   but it's still used in the right patient.
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:28.020]   Non-ablative resurfacing,
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:30.580]   meaning it doesn't vaporize the top layer,
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.980]   but drills holes into the dermis
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.540]   and targets certain parts of the epidermis
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.060]   without causing burn injury,
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:39.660]   that's become much more popular
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.220]   because the downtime is markedly less.
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:45.940]   People can go back to work and enjoy their activities.
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:48.140]   While having pretty much the same benefits,
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:52.380]   albeit a little bit less than ablative lasers,
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:56.140]   these we generally recommend annually or biannually,
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:58.420]   depending on what you're trying to target.
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:00.860]   A large Harvard study just came out
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:05.180]   that showed that non-ablative fractionated laser resurfacing,
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:07.860]   particularly with a device called Fraxel,
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.500]   actually cuts your skin cancer risk by 20%
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.340]   because it eliminates those mutations
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.460]   and gets rid of those cells
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.260]   that had been collecting the stuff.
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:17.660]   It's amazing.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:20.220]   - How is this different than exfoliating skin?
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:23.540]   Like if one were to just try and scrape away
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:27.140]   some of the dead skin through some, you know,
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.540]   semi-vigorous buffing of the skin with like a sponge.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.180]   I've never done either of these procedures.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.260]   Like I said, my skincare routine is very basic.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:36.620]   It's the unscented dove soap.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:39.140]   The shower once or twice a day and-
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:40.980]   - Your skin looks great, so keep doing what you're doing.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.940]   - I mean, I feel pretty good.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.500]   I mean, I think, you know,
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.620]   sleep seems to play a significant role for me.
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:51.820]   I do get probably a bit more sun exposure than most people.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.700]   I'm conscious of checking for skin cancers
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:58.740]   and we'll talk about that because those do run in my family.
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.720]   But, and I try and eat right and exercise right.
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:05.700]   Haven't consumed much alcohol in my lifetime.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.700]   - Well, your skin will tell you if something's wrong.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:08.860]   So that's the first line.
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:11.220]   Now you talk about, you know,
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.820]   dermabrasion or microdermabrasion,
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.060]   the good old St. Ives apricot scrub
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:17.540]   that every dermatologist, you know, frowns upon.
[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:20.220]   But ironically, I use myself after a heavy workout
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.340]   at the beach and I'm all greasy,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.060]   but don't, you know,
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.580]   don't get mad at me for using that stuff.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:26.420]   The depth is key.
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:28.540]   So when we do microdermabrasion
[01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:29.740]   or some sort of dermabrasion,
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:31.500]   the only thing we're really scraping off
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.380]   is really the stratum corneum,
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:37.220]   which is the highest layer of skin cells
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.820]   that don't even have a nucleus.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:39.860]   They're dead skin cells.
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.220]   That's all you're scraping off.
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:44.640]   Whereas lasers target through the epidermis
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.980]   and into the dermis and you control for that depth.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:51.180]   And what you control for is the amount of heat energy
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:54.580]   delivered to that depth to target a certain thing.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:59.580]   So in theory, what you describe in terms of dermabrasion
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:03.940]   is the same premise the old school ablative lasers do.
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:06.660]   They just fry everything off and you grow new skin.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.140]   And in frying everything off,
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:12.220]   it fries off sun damage, wrinkles,
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.300]   pre-cancers and skin cancers.
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:17.900]   But in doing that, you're a bloody mess for a few weeks.
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:22.340]   Not popular for many reasons, but very effective.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.620]   We did a ton of this at Stanford
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.220]   and we did a ton of the other one at Stanford.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.180]   In my practice, I do a lot of laser work as well.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:30.300]   The non-ablative stuff picks and chooses.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:33.700]   That was the beauty of learning about laser
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.700]   and photobiology is how we target a certain structure
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   and avoid damaging all the other ones.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:45.740]   That's the theory of selective photothermalysis
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:48.000]   that came out of Rox Anderson's lab at Harvard.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.740]   That was the game changer.
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:53.380]   We can now pick any appendage in the skin
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.500]   and find a way to target it and leave the rest undisturbed.
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.340]   So if you have broken blood vessels,
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.100]   you decide to use BPC-157 and it worked great
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.540]   and the blood vessels started to grow
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:04.020]   and you're like, I don't like the look of them.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.420]   There is a laser that targets solely blood vessels.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:09.540]   - Is that the IPL laser?
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:11.140]   - IPL is okay.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.660]   IPL stands for intense pulse light.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:16.900]   It's somewhat effective, but not very effective.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:20.500]   The gold standard is what we call the pulse dye laser
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:21.980]   or the V-beam laser.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:27.220]   That is a 595 nanometer laser that targets oxyhemoglobin.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:31.380]   - I've had that actually because I had an angioma.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.220]   - Yeah.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.580]   - Had it three times and the third time they hit this thing,
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:39.980]   it went away, but not without a very significant bruise
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:41.500]   lasting almost a month.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.300]   I mean, it was pretty dramatic.
[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.140]   - Never done it.
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:50.060]   - Right, but it did eliminate the vessel.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.700]   - By any means necessary, right?
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:52.940]   It just nuked the skin.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:55.900]   - So as long as we're on the topic of photobiomodulation,
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:58.220]   what about red light, near-infrared light?
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.060]   Is there any evidence
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:01.720]   that it can benefit skin health and appearance?
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.380]   Nowadays, you can find masks that will emit red light.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.780]   Some people will purchase red lights.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.020]   They stand in front of.
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.060]   - I think they're very effective.
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:11.000]   I think they work great.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.740]   The question is to what extent
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:16.160]   is that improvement objective and measurable
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.420]   and what extent is subjective?
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.460]   That being said, there's a lot of evidence
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.900]   that shows that red light therapy
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:25.100]   improves vascular flow in the skin.
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:28.060]   We use it for things like hair restoration,
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.740]   post-procedure recovery,
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:33.740]   improvement in skin health after UV damage.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:36.100]   We actually found a recent study
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:41.100]   that looked at red light therapy and irradiating mice.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.460]   And if you pre-treat the mice with red light therapy
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:49.420]   before they get UV exposure compared to controls,
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:52.060]   the pre-treated group had much less
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.680]   of the changes with UV exposure.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.280]   So very fascinating stuff.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.980]   How it works, uncertain.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:02.380]   We think a lot of it has to do with increased vascular flow,
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:03.580]   which is why a lot of times
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.020]   we recommend it for post-procedure.
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:08.700]   We recommend it for hair regrowth.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.980]   There's some evidence that if you increase blood flow
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:13.540]   to the dermal papilla of the hair, it grows new hair.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.220]   That's how minoxidil or Rogaine works.
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.100]   But I like it.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.740]   I think it's a great product,
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.140]   great group of products or devices.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.740]   As a standalone,
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:28.780]   uncertain as to how effective they are.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:33.100]   And one of the reasons of the heterogeneity in the data
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:35.260]   or like so much difference
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.220]   is there's no regulation in terms of the energy,
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:41.280]   the density of light, the type of light,
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.100]   the duration of treatment.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:47.140]   So some devices have high wattage, high energy output,
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:48.900]   high density of lights.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:51.780]   They may be more effective than its equivalent counterpart.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:56.780]   And until that gets defined more uniform in accessibility,
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:01.860]   I don't know which device to recommend.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.660]   I obviously have preferences one way or another,
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.380]   but there's so much on the market
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.560]   that's marketed as red light that is not effective
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.460]   and some stuff that's really good.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.820]   - So probably looking for something
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:16.180]   that's at least endorsed by dermatologists.
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:17.420]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:21.260]   - And I should say here, I have no angle into this.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.260]   These masks that emit red light,
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:25.860]   I don't have any business relationship to them.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:26.860]   So that's not why I bring it up.
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:27.800]   I was just very curious.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.460]   I see them in my Instagram feed,
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:32.700]   probably by virtue of doing public facing
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:35.940]   health and science information and my interest in light.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:38.180]   What about, oh, yes, excuse me.
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.260]   - I was going to say the panels
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.020]   tend to be much higher in energy, much more effective.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:45.060]   And most of the studies have looked at the big wall panels.
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.340]   The battery powered face masks
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:50.380]   just aren't powered enough to have much improvement.
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:52.580]   We do see some improvement when red and blue
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.760]   is used together, mostly for acne prone skin,
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:58.840]   because blue light alone has some antimicrobial properties.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.400]   So when used in conjunction,
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:04.060]   you can get some improvement in actual skin illnesses.
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.220]   But the masks alone with just red light,
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.100]   most of them are not powered enough.
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:10.380]   They don't have enough energy,
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:12.460]   but there are some that are good.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:14.780]   The wall panels tend to be better.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:15.620]   - Thank you for that.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:18.500]   And full disclosure, I was accurate in saying
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:19.780]   that I don't have any relationship
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.540]   to any red light masks companies or products,
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:25.340]   but this podcast is sponsored by Juve,
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:27.420]   which makes medical grade panels
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.660]   for red light and near infrared light.
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:30.640]   And I do own one of those and I use,
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.900]   I have a small portable one I use
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.380]   and then I have a panel I stand in front of.
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.940]   So that includes my face and then I'll turn around
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:39.480]   and do a whole body couple times a week.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.460]   Juve is a good company.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.380]   It's been around for a while.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:44.780]   And most of the experts in laser and photobiology
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:47.840]   agree the panels are the way to go if you want red light.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:51.420]   - It's interesting when people see and hear about red light
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:52.980]   and near infrared light therapies,
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:53.820]   I think a lot of people think,
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:57.540]   "Oh, this is kind of like next stage biohacking."
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:00.900]   But there was a Nobel prize given for photobiomodulation
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:04.380]   for the treatment of lupus in the early 1900s.
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:06.860]   So this is a longstanding thing,
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:09.140]   the use of light of particular wavelengths
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:11.040]   or combinations of wavelengths
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.100]   of which red light and blue light are, of course,
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:15.180]   in order to target different layers within the skin
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:16.980]   to get some desired effect.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.980]   - Yeah, light has been around for a long time.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:21.740]   I have a phototherapy unit in my practice
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:25.340]   in which we use narrow band ultraviolet B light
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.060]   to treat conditions like psoriasis,
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:30.160]   to treat conditions like vitiligo.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.940]   There's a very strong immunomodulatory effect
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.740]   of light on the skin.
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:39.820]   It actually suppresses overactive immune activity.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:43.060]   It can help increase vascularity in the skin.
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:44.340]   It can improve blood flow.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:46.220]   So depending on the wavelength you pick
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.740]   and where it overlies on the absorption curves
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:51.540]   makes a big difference.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.820]   It's interesting that we talk about light
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.820]   and as a skin cancer surgeon,
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.260]   this has always been interesting to me
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:03.980]   in that we use UV light to treat certain conditions
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:08.580]   and we assume UV light is purely pathogenic.
[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.940]   And I don't think that's the case.
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.340]   And why I bring this up is one of the most common things
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:17.340]   we use like light therapy for is patients with vitiligo,
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:19.080]   which is this autoimmune condition
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.280]   in which your immune system attacks the cells
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:23.380]   that produce our skin color.
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:26.220]   And the standard treatment is certain creams
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.460]   that suppress the immune system in the skin,
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:33.460]   phototherapy, eczema laser, which is a UV laser.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:37.620]   And then now the new world of immunotherapies by pill form,
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:39.540]   the Jack inhibitors have made a huge difference.
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:43.540]   But if we thought, and I go back on this tangent
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.540]   'cause the more we think about it, the less we know.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:49.180]   If we think UV is truly deleterious,
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.500]   then patients with vitiligo
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:52.700]   should have an higher incidence of skin cancer.
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.580]   And in fact, the opposite is true.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.940]   They have a lower incidence of skin cancer
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:00.880]   even when you match them for amount of UV exposure over time.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.760]   So it goes to tell us that there's so much
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.640]   about light and skin we don't understand,
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.080]   so much about sun and UV and skin we don't understand
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.840]   and an incredible component about our skin's immune system
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.220]   that we're only now figuring out that play an important role.
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:20.960]   Patients who have transplants, for example,
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.760]   transplant patients in the early '90s,
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.200]   the number one cause of death for transplant patients
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.180]   that was not related to their transplant
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:33.120]   was metastatic skin cancer.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.160]   And this was in patients who were strictly sun protected.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:42.160]   So we talk about biology, photobiology, LED, UV,
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.100]   and skin health, and there's so much we don't know
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:48.120]   as we gather more data and look at populations and cohorts.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.680]   So I don't know why I brought that up as a tangent, but.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:52.160]   - No, I think it's a very relevant tangent
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:54.520]   because the relationship between immune system function
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.480]   and skin is very clear.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:59.040]   And these conditions that you're referring to,
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:02.860]   vitiligo, acne, psoriasis, eczema, et cetera,
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:05.020]   have interesting relationships to the immune system.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:07.000]   So that's actually a perfect segue
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]   for what I'd like to talk about next.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:09.840]   - Sure.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:12.840]   - So let's start with psoriasis.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:13.760]   - Yeah. - What is the story
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.820]   with psoriasis?
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.220]   What is it?
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.580]   What can make it worse?
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:19.320]   What can make it better?
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:22.140]   - Psoriasis is like the quintessential skin condition.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.580]   I have it myself on my elbows and knees.
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:28.660]   And for about 100 years, it was thought to be a problem,
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:33.180]   a rash that is caused by too much skin turnover
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:35.780]   or excess skin proliferation.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.060]   And for 100 years, we treated it the same way.
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:41.460]   We gave medicines that basically took the skin off,
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:43.740]   what we call keratolytics.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:45.420]   We found that that wasn't very effective.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:48.100]   And some people can be hospitalized
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.380]   and it can be life-threatening
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:51.700]   if psoriasis involves the entire body.
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:55.460]   It usually looks like red patches or plaques
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.880]   with kind of a silvery scale on the surface
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:01.820]   and starts usually elbows and knees or the scalp,
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:04.660]   but can involve pretty much the entirety of the body.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:06.820]   And what we found in the last 30 years
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:08.260]   with a lot of elegant studies
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:11.980]   and a lot of very, very nice basic science research
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:15.140]   is that it's actually due to overactivity
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.400]   of our skin's immune system.
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.740]   So there's overactivity of certain interleukins,
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.740]   which are these messengers that our immune cells produce,
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:27.580]   that makes the skin turnover faster than it should.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:30.020]   And this epiphany was remarkable
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:33.180]   because we found that instead of targeting the skin,
[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:35.780]   we can target the immune system
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:39.580]   and we can eradicate or treat psoriasis entirely.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:42.120]   And in the '90s and early 2000s,
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.020]   that targeting was very crude.
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:46.400]   It was a very umbrella approach.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:48.420]   We suppressed the entire immune system
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.220]   and ran into the consequences of that.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.500]   So medications that we gave for that
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:57.260]   increased risk for infections and skin cancers, et cetera.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:02.260]   Now we have amazing drugs that target one or two molecules,
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:05.220]   messenger molecules of our immune system
[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:06.780]   and clear up people's psoriasis.
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:09.180]   I mean, we have drugs now you take three times a year
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.180]   and you could have head-to-toe psoriasis
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:13.020]   and be completely clear.
[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.540]   It tends to run in families.
[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.460]   There is a very strong hereditary
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:18.260]   or genetic component to it.
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:21.820]   And it tends to be associated with arthritis,
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:24.180]   psoriatic arthritis.
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:27.580]   So psoriasis is like the quintessential skin condition
[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:31.620]   that people see dermatologists and even rheumatologists for.
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:34.420]   - So these drugs that target these specific interleukins
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.620]   seem like the most direct way to treat psoriasis.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:39.460]   Some people, for whatever reason,
[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:41.840]   have an aversion to prescription drugs.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:42.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.700]   - I'm not necessarily one of those people,
[02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:47.260]   but I, like everybody else, would like to know
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:50.980]   what we can do to reduce symptoms of things like psoriasis
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:53.100]   without having to "take anything."
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:54.700]   - Yeah, I should probably backtrack.
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:57.280]   So psoriasis obviously comes in severity.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:59.640]   There's mild disease, which majority of people have.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.340]   There's moderate and severe.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.620]   And generally speaking, the most common things
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:08.340]   that we treat mild psoriasis with is creams and lotions,
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:12.040]   moisturizers, sometimes low-potency topical steroids
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.740]   or high-potency topical steroids,
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:17.040]   and then things like keratolytics, like salicylic acid,
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.820]   that take that excess scale off.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.980]   We also know that there,
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:24.300]   because it's an immune inflammatory condition,
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.980]   that diet plays a big role
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:28.980]   in improving mild or moderate cases.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:32.780]   And we also know that weight loss plays a very big role
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:34.980]   in improving the appearance of psoriasis.
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.820]   So as we lose weight,
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.460]   as there's improvement in insulin resistance,
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:42.980]   and as we transition diets and lifestyles
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.900]   from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory,
[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:49.620]   psoriasis tends to clear without any intervention needed,
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.300]   without any medical intervention needed.
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.260]   If there's still continued rashes and skin activity,
[02:07:56.260 --> 02:08:01.260]   then you'd look at topicals like cortisones,
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:05.100]   emollients like Aquaphor and Vaseline,
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:06.940]   things with some sort of acid
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.340]   or a retinoid to get rid of that excess scale.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.300]   That's the fundamental cornerstone of treating psoriasis.
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:13.620]   And then when it gets bad,
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.500]   we talk about additional pharmacologic interventions.
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:21.180]   Also, interestingly, one of the earliest conditions
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.220]   in which phototherapy was used is psoriasis.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:27.620]   We know that when we shine UV light on the skin,
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:30.300]   that it suppresses the skin's immune system
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:31.660]   and clear psoriasis.
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:33.380]   And that's an excellent way to treat it
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:35.420]   without pharmacologic intervention,
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:37.700]   without any creams, pills, injections,
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:39.820]   or otherwise medication.
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:41.740]   It used to be used in the Dead Sea.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:44.940]   People would go lather in the mud in the Dead Sea
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.060]   and sit out in the sun.
[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:49.820]   And that was the first crude way to use phototherapy
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:51.180]   to treat psoriasis.
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:52.060]   - That was my question.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.500]   Since the sun emits UV,
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:56.820]   why not just get some additional sunlight exposure
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:57.820]   for psoriasis?
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:02.740]   - So you can, most dermatologists wouldn't recommend it.
[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.300]   I think it's actually not a bad thing.
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:06.580]   My psoriasis clears in the summertime
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:08.700]   and flares in the wintertime.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:10.860]   The problem with pure sunlight
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:14.180]   is that it's a mix of rays, right?
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:16.460]   There's X-rays, gamma rays,
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:18.420]   which generally don't penetrate the atmosphere.
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:22.540]   There's UVC, UVB, UVA, visible light, infrared light.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.820]   So that heterogeneous light,
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:28.900]   some have no improvement in psoriasis
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.740]   and some have great improvement.
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:33.180]   So we were able to figure out which wavelengths
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:34.060]   make a big difference.
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:37.020]   And it's around the 311, 312 nanometer range.
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:40.020]   But sunlight does clear people's psoriasis up.
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:42.700]   That's why we see in Northern latitudes
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.260]   where there's less sun intensity,
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:47.460]   the incidence of psoriasis is markedly higher
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:49.500]   than equatorial latitudes.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:51.820]   And patients will say their psoriasis gets better
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.260]   when they're on a beach vacation.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:55.900]   When they go back home, their psoriasis flares.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:58.260]   There's also some component with vitamin D as well,
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:09:59.980]   but I think that's just secondary
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:03.020]   to the lack of UV exposure.
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:04.420]   - What about vitiligo?
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:06.740]   This is something I did not cover
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.180]   in the solo episode about skin health,
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:12.140]   but I got a lot of questions about vitiligo,
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:15.180]   of course, being this typically patchy,
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:17.540]   non-pigmented regions of skin
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:23.060]   that you said is at least some cases
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:25.440]   are related to the immune system.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.140]   These people get skin cancers less often, is that right?
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:34.900]   - Yeah, so vitiligo is autoimmune,
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:37.900]   meaning your immune system is attacking itself,
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:40.700]   depigmentary skin disorder,
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:43.420]   meaning it's a condition in which your immune system
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.740]   attacks and kills the melanocytes,
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:48.580]   which are the cells that produce our skin's color.
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:51.660]   And we've found that it's an autoimmune condition
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:54.300]   from many basic science and elegant studies.
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:57.100]   It's also very closely associated
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.140]   with other autoimmune conditions.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:04.140]   So patients tend to also have atopic dermatitis,
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:07.140]   autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune anemia.
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:09.140]   There's some sort of immune dyscrasia
[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:11.380]   that involves vitiligo patients.
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:13.660]   And what happens is the immune system
[02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:16.940]   at first paralyzes these cells
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:20.100]   with immune activity attacking them.
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.300]   And over time, these cells no longer survive and die off.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:28.100]   The cornerstone in treatment has always been
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:30.940]   some way to suppress the skin's immune response.
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:34.140]   When most of the time vitiligo tends to be focal,
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:37.100]   single areas or segmental.
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.380]   Unfortunately, in certain cases it can be whole body
[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:41.220]   or completely depigmenting.
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:44.060]   Very uncommon, but we see this.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.220]   We treat it by doing things
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:50.500]   that'll help quiet the immune response in the skin.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:52.900]   So topical creams, topical steroids, et cetera,
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:54.900]   topical calcineurin inhibitors,
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:58.860]   which are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:02.260]   We also use certain wavelengths of UV light to treat this,
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:07.260]   eczema laser at 308 nanometers, UVB, UVA.
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:09.940]   And then the renaissance in vitiligo
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:12.020]   has happened in the last three or four years
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:15.400]   with the identification of JAK inhibitors,
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.740]   which are these drugs that block the Janus kinase pathway.
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:21.660]   And we found that the JAK stat pathway
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:23.540]   plays a really important role
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.060]   in autoimmune mediation of melanocyte death.
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:31.220]   So new creams and actually oral medications have come out
[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.400]   for patients who have very refractory vitiligo.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.660]   The immune component is very fascinating
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:40.420]   because understanding immune biology
[02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:43.340]   and the immune system's effects on skin health
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:45.180]   comes from studying these patients.
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:49.260]   When patients have vitiligo, they lose all of their color.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:51.700]   So you would assume that they're much more susceptible
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:54.440]   to sunburns, which they are.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.340]   But when you look at incidents of skin cancers,
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:01.140]   they have a significantly lower incidence of skin cancer.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:04.460]   And this is because of the immune phenomenon
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:06.460]   in immune surveillance of cancer.
[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:07.780]   And that occurs throughout the body,
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:10.040]   but the skin is a model platform for this.
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:13.020]   What happens is your immune system surveys
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:14.860]   for mutant changes that occur,
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:17.780]   whether it's UV related, et cetera,
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:19.940]   infection, toxin, whatever.
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.540]   And patients who have vitiligo have overactivity
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.060]   of these immune cells and over surveillance.
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:28.420]   So they are able to clear a lot of these pre-cancerous
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:31.340]   changes before they form into something.
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:33.380]   So that played a big role in not only understanding
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:36.480]   how to treat vitiligo, but some of our new medicines,
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:39.900]   actually the medicines that won the Nobel Prize in 2018
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:42.860]   for treating melanoma came from understanding
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:47.100]   immune activity and cancer pathogenesis.
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.060]   - It's fascinating.
[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:51.540]   Again, speaking to the fact that skin is far more
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:54.220]   than just this protective outer sheath.
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:58.380]   It's a reflection of so much that's going on internally.
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:02.420]   And we know that intuitively also by observing others.
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:04.220]   I think this is one of several ways that parents
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:06.340]   can communicate well with their children
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:09.300]   or their children with their parents rather,
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:11.820]   in terms of how they're feeling prior to language.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:16.820]   You know, they'll look at their skin, their stool,
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:19.420]   obviously fussiness and mood and those things too.
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.980]   But we seem to have developed an intuitive understanding
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.340]   that a shift in the kind of like tone of the skin
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.980]   or some other features of the skin signal to us
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:28.780]   wellness or lack of wellness.
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:30.740]   - Yeah, the skin's a biosensor.
[02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:33.940]   The entire skin, hair, nails is a biosensor.
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:37.060]   So you can utilize the skin as the first barometer
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:37.900]   of illness.
[02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:40.700]   I mean, from acute illness to chronic illness,
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:43.580]   acutely you can see changes in just like looking pal,
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:46.100]   you know, with pallor, looking ghastly, things like that.
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:47.860]   But chronic illness as well.
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:49.440]   You know, when you used to go to the pediatrician
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.320]   and they would do this to look at your eyes,
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:53.120]   what they were looking for was the color
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.820]   of the conjunctiva.
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.540]   If it was white or pale,
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:58.420]   they knew you had iron deficiency.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:01.620]   You know, when kids get hand, foot, mouth syndrome
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:04.420]   and they have a high fever, they lose their fingernails.
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:06.260]   When college students are stressed out,
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:07.500]   they lose their hair.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:11.060]   The body's amazing ability to tell you it's under stress
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.740]   is shown in the skin, hair and nails.
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:15.060]   What it does is it says, why am I wasting energy
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:17.260]   producing something that is not necessary
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:19.100]   because I'm fighting something else?
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:20.860]   Let's just shed this.
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.900]   And you can tell right away.
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:24.980]   I mean, we used to in clinic when I'd see, you know,
[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:27.380]   medical students or college students come in,
[02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:28.340]   I knew it was finals week.
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.020]   They'd come with clumps of hair.
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:32.180]   And as soon as finals week passed,
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:35.120]   usually took a few months, their hair grew back.
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.020]   It's awesome.
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:39.220]   The skin's a really cool biosensor and you can tell a lot.
[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:40.380]   - It is so cool.
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:42.940]   What about acne?
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:43.780]   - Yeah.
[02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:44.940]   - Acne seems very common, you know,
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:47.500]   as we progress through puberty,
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:48.820]   there seems to be more acne.
[02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:51.180]   Sometimes it's transient, sometimes it's not.
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:52.020]   - Yeah.
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:53.380]   - What are some things that people can do
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:56.180]   to prevent or reduce acne?
[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:59.060]   - Another quintessential derm problem
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:02.460]   that is affects so many people.
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:05.300]   Acne tends to be a condition that is bimodal,
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:08.500]   meaning we tend to see it in adolescents.
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:11.980]   We tend to see it in 25 to 35 year olds.
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:13.620]   And for the unfortunate group of people
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:18.020]   that bridge that gap, we see it anywhere from 12 to 35.
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:22.220]   Acne is a condition that's usually seen by pimples.
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:25.020]   You know, what we call blackheads or whiteheads,
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:27.180]   zits or boils.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:30.940]   And it's thought to be caused by three important things.
[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:34.180]   It's an overproduction of sebum,
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.100]   which is the oily stuff that comes out of your skin.
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:39.400]   And that's dictated by your hormones.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:43.580]   Your hormones will increase the output of sebum.
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.660]   And that usually occurs in puberty,
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:48.220]   but can also occur if you're taking medications
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:52.260]   like prednisone, cortisol, testosterone,
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.840]   anything that is a hormone driver.
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:55.900]   So sebum is the first cause.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:59.420]   Sebum is the food for the bacteria that cause acne.
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:02.520]   So as there's more food, the bacteria proliferate.
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.780]   And in proliferation, it recruits an immune response.
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:06.620]   Your immune system says,
[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:09.700]   "Hey, there's a little bit too much of these organisms.
[02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.420]   "Let's go and take care of them."
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:13.100]   That's where you get that red zit.
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:16.860]   So in treating acne, you gotta treat all three components
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:19.780]   to get really effectively clear skin.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:23.580]   Somehow reduce the sebum, get rid of the bacteria,
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:25.180]   and calm the immune system down.
[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:30.080]   That's done with creams, oral medications,
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.780]   a combination of both.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:35.460]   Sometimes certain lasers can help eradicate the oil glands
[02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:36.780]   that feed the bacteria.
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:40.700]   But acne's a fascinating condition.
[02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:44.380]   Almost everybody will have it at some point in their life.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.140]   - Is it true that eating a diet
[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:50.780]   that is of slight excess in calories,
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:52.860]   because it will tend to push
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:55.180]   the insulin glucose regulation system
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:58.380]   more into the positive as opposed to,
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:18:00.540]   let's just say higher levels of insulin
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.640]   and circulating blood glucose
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:05.100]   than one would observe at, say, maintenance calories
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:07.580]   or sub-maintenance calories that, you know,
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:10.860]   overeating a little bit could cause acne,
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:14.960]   that any foods that promote increases
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.820]   in glucose and insulin,
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:20.500]   so sugary foods, high glycemic foods,
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.340]   these sorts of things,
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.540]   can that actually increase acne, fried foods?
[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:29.540]   - So it's not the caloric deficit or the caloric surplus.
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:33.740]   It's the glycemic index or the amount of insulin response.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:37.600]   So we know that high glycemic index foods
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:38.780]   will make acne worse.
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:40.460]   And almost every study that we've looked at
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:44.180]   in sugary processed foods will flare your acne.
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.220]   There's some component of that inflammatory response
[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:50.460]   that not only drives even production and bacterial growth,
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:53.300]   but actually worsens the skin's immune response.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:55.220]   The skin's immune response is a little feisty
[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:58.080]   when you're eating pro-inflammatory things.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:01.360]   The other thing that I do hear a lot about is dairy.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.660]   And there's this misconception that dairy causes acne.
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:08.260]   What we really see when we looked at a really cool study
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.960]   that was done out of Penn State
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:14.340]   is that it's not so much whole fat dairy products,
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.880]   but skim and non-fat dairy products
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:18.380]   that can make your acne flare.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:19.860]   And the reason for that is that usually
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:20.740]   in the United States,
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.500]   there's an emulsifier that's put in non-fat
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:26.900]   or skim products to give the same mouth feel as full fat.
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:28.320]   So people feel like they're getting the same
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.340]   without the calories.
[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:31.880]   And that has a glycemic response.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:33.980]   So it's usually sugary foods,
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:36.660]   non-fat skim dairy products
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:38.660]   that will make your acne flare.
[02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:40.860]   - What about rosacea?
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:42.500]   I hear so much about this,
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:45.940]   and I'm going to assume that we can mark off
[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:48.700]   at least one thing as clear,
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:51.500]   which is that alcohol can exacerbate rosacea,
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:55.220]   maybe directly, but certainly indirectly
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.420]   by impeding some aspects of the microbiome,
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:01.020]   disrupting sleep, rosacea gets worse.
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:03.820]   But what are things that people can do?
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:07.300]   Do's and don'ts that is for rosacea.
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:10.700]   If it's mild rosacea, like excessively ruddy cheeks
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:14.940]   or superficial riding capillaries
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:17.100]   that seem to bother a lot of people.
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.580]   I know that it bothers a lot of people
[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:20.660]   because they asked about this quite a lot
[02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:24.620]   in the questions when I solicited for questions.
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:28.940]   - So rosacea, it's commonly known as adult acne,
[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:31.180]   tends to come in four flavors.
[02:20:31.180 --> 02:20:34.340]   The first form is the redness form,
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:37.060]   what we call erythematotelangic tatic form,
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:40.100]   or the ruddiness, broken blood vessels,
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:41.820]   redness of the cheeks and flushing.
[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:44.260]   That's by and far the most common form.
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:46.180]   There's also the papulopustular form,
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:47.340]   which is the pimple form,
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:50.780]   which is what we think about in adult acne.
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:52.580]   There's also the fimatus form,
[02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:54.780]   which is the enlargement of the nose
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:56.540]   that kind of looks like toad skin.
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:00.020]   We used to think it was a sign of alcoholism or sailors
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:02.780]   or construction workers
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:04.460]   that would have these enlarged nose.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:06.540]   We thought it was a product of their environment
[02:21:06.540 --> 02:21:08.180]   that's actually a form of rosacea.
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:11.540]   And then there's ocular rosacea, which affects the eyes.
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.420]   By and far, the two most common
[02:21:13.420 --> 02:21:16.740]   that we see people in practice for is the redness form,
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.460]   redness and flushing, or the pimple form.
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:21.100]   You're absolutely right in that alcohol
[02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:23.220]   can contribute to it and worsen it for two reasons.
[02:21:23.220 --> 02:21:25.540]   One, alcohol itself is a vasodilator
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.340]   and acetaldehyde is a much more potent vasodilator.
[02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:30.460]   So when you drink, you flush.
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:33.620]   Also chronic impairment of the gut microbiome
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:35.620]   and lifestyle changes that make you drink more
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:39.220]   probably will exacerbate your rosacea.
[02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:42.220]   But things that trigger the redness include UV light
[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:45.900]   because of vasodilation, spicy foods,
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.660]   hot beverages, emotions, life stressors,
[02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:50.540]   all the things that make you flush.
[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:55.660]   What triggers the breakouts is a little bit different.
[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:57.540]   And why that's important is how we treat them.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:00.180]   So what triggers breakouts is thought to be
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:02.460]   both organisms that live on our skin,
[02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:04.980]   including bacteria and certain mites,
[02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:07.780]   but also immune dysregulation in our skin.
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:11.860]   That we don't really understand or just now elucidating
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:15.020]   how the immune system in the skin becomes dysfunctional
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:16.860]   to show those breakouts.
[02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:18.980]   In terms of treating redness,
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:22.380]   we have some creams that are okay
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:24.860]   at temporarily blanching those vessels out,
[02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:27.020]   but they're not great and they're temporary.
[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:28.700]   We don't have great treatments for them,
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:32.020]   but we have great lasers for redness.
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:34.220]   So when patients come to see me for redness
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:35.900]   or any dermatologist for redness,
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:38.300]   generally there's a discussion about laser destruction
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:39.540]   of those blood vessels.
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:43.740]   When we talk about breakouts or pimple form of rosacea,
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:46.740]   we have excellent medications in terms of both creams
[02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:51.100]   and oral medications that suppress both the bacterial
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:55.340]   and mite growth as well as the immune response in the skin.
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:57.780]   So you kind of have to take a look at what form you have
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:00.020]   and what will be the best treatment.
[02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:01.020]   - Eczema.
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:04.100]   - Umbrella term for what we generally consider
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:05.940]   as atopic dermatitis,
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.460]   or what used to be colloquially termed
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:12.100]   as sensitive skin in childhood.
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:16.340]   And that's a very prominent skin condition
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:21.140]   also dictated by the immune system, but in two forms.
[02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:25.220]   Eczema tends to be caused by three major prongs.
[02:23:25.220 --> 02:23:30.180]   The first prong is a genetic barrier defect in the skin.
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:33.300]   So patients with eczema tend to have a microscopic weave
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.700]   of their skin that's not as tight
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:37.460]   as somebody without eczema.
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:40.940]   And that's usually defined by a gene called filaggrin.
[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:46.380]   That's the first reason to develop eczema.
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:51.380]   The second reason is an environmental allergen or trigger
[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:54.620]   that's able to get through these weaves easier
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:57.380]   because of this genetic change.
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:00.500]   The third thing is an aberrant immune response
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:01.700]   to these triggers.
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.780]   So patients with eczema tend to have an immune system
[02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:08.780]   that responds a little bit more vigorously or overactively
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:10.860]   to the same environmental trigger,
[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:12.980]   probably because there's more trigger getting in
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:16.340]   through the barrier defect than somebody who doesn't.
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:18.660]   So the cornerstone in treating eczema
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:20.340]   is treating these three things.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:22.580]   Why dermatologists make a big stink
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:25.620]   about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize for eczema
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:29.100]   is to seal that barrier with a moisturizer
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.940]   because we're basically putting the mortar
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:33.900]   back in between the bricks, which are the skin cells,
[02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:35.820]   to seal the skin off,
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:38.620]   to not allow the environmental allergen to get in.
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:39.460]   That's the first.
[02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:42.540]   The second is to avoid environmental triggers.
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:46.540]   So fragrances, preservatives, seasonal allergies,
[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:48.820]   pollens, things that trigger that immune response,
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:49.860]   we try to mitigate.
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:53.140]   Now, obviously trying to control environmental pollens
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:57.540]   is hard, but using things like we talked about earlier,
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:25:00.900]   fragrance-free cleansers, fragrance-free detergents,
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:04.300]   fragrance-free skincare products,
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:06.660]   non-preservative-based skincare products
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:08.780]   will mitigate the environmental triggers.
[02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:09.900]   And then the third thing
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:12.340]   is just calming the immune system down.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:14.460]   And that can be done in a variety of ways.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:16.780]   Most commonly, it's topical medications
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:19.260]   like topical steroids that dampen the immune system
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.340]   and the skin.
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.700]   And when eczema is really, really bad,
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:25.540]   there are biologic medications
[02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:27.740]   that control certain interleukins,
[02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:31.340]   and they've made an incredible advancement
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:32.660]   in eczema control.
[02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:35.140]   People, we can control patients for life
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:37.580]   with some of these injectable medicines.
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.940]   - A couple of things that you taught me
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:41.660]   that I just wanna pass along in short form,
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:44.060]   and please correct me if I have this wrong.
[02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:46.820]   One, if you can avoid popping pimples,
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:49.340]   definitely avoid it because it can cause damage,
[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:52.220]   recruitment of these matrix metalloproteases,
[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:54.540]   which essentially digest some of the deeper layers
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:56.380]   of the skin, leave scars.
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:57.460]   - Yeah, yeah, totally.
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:00.300]   So it's, I mean, it's very gratifying,
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:01.220]   and you wanna do it.
[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:05.220]   There's like some subconscious desire to like pop a pimple.
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:06.060]   I have it myself.
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:07.100]   Anytime I see a pimple, I'm like,
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.880]   "Man, I gotta, I wanna get at this thing."
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:12.020]   - I think it's to eradicate the infection type of thing.
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:13.540]   You know, even if it's not an infection,
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:14.380]   I think that's the- - Possibly,
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:16.460]   like a evolutionary reason.
[02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:17.960]   - Yeah, very, very possible.
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:20.980]   The reason we don't wanna do that,
[02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:23.220]   and the reason why we always say don't pick at your skin
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:26.840]   is when there's an immune response in the skin,
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:28.940]   the immune system's trying to fix something
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:29.780]   and fight something,
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:33.080]   and in doing so, it recruits different enzymes.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:35.620]   The most common enzyme is what you exactly described,
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.580]   matrix metalloproteinases,
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:40.540]   which are these enzymes that eat apart collagen and elastin
[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:42.140]   to allow it to remodel.
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:45.900]   When you cause physical trauma in the skin,
[02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:48.580]   you recruit a much larger immune response
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:51.540]   than what was warranted for that insult.
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:54.740]   So these MMPs, these matrix metalloproteinases,
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:56.860]   enter at a much higher amount,
[02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:59.460]   and they eat away at the collagen and elastin.
[02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:01.700]   That's what leaves an acne scar.
[02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:04.180]   Now, people are gonna pop their pimples,
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:05.780]   whether we want to or not.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.520]   So if you're gonna do it, I don't recommend it,
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.500]   but if you're gonna do it,
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:14.380]   generally what we recommend is if there is no tip,
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:15.780]   don't even think about it.
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:17.820]   If there is a small white tip
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.620]   and not much pain or induration,
[02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:22.740]   you can use a warm compress to see if you can soften that
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:25.140]   and see if it'll expel itself.
[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:26.740]   Pushing, we don't recommend.
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:30.860]   Stretching can sometimes unroof a pimple,
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:32.960]   tends to cause less trauma.
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:36.240]   But again, if you listen to one thing, don't do it.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:39.780]   - And if they pop on their own,
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:41.220]   can't believe we're having this conversation,
[02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:44.700]   but it's a skin health and appearance episode after all,
[02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:45.620]   if they pop on their own,
[02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:48.340]   then cleaning it with a gentle cleanser
[02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:49.700]   is probably the best way to go.
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.700]   No topical antibiotics, is that right?
[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:54.380]   - Don't use any hydrogen peroxide.
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:57.700]   It's a common misconception thinking it fights things.
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:27:59.220]   Peroxide doesn't let wounds heal.
[02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:00.380]   It just kills anything living.
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:04.460]   So no peroxide and no topical antibiotics
[02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:05.340]   that are over the counter.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.900]   Most of these don't have any antibiotic properties anyway,
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:09.660]   'cause most organisms are resistant to them
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.740]   because of the widespread availability and use.
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:15.540]   And two, they cause a lot of allergic contact,
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:18.700]   dermatitis and rashes in people who are susceptible to them.
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:22.380]   So we just say, if it pops on its own, leave it alone.
[02:28:22.380 --> 02:28:23.820]   They wanna put a little ointment on there
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:26.660]   if you have a sore, but otherwise ignore it.
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:30.420]   - And what about the use of corticosterone cream?
[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:31.900]   Like if somebody has a red bump
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:33.580]   and they're headed to an event or something
[02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:38.580]   and they wanna eliminate some of the redness and bumpiness.
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:42.300]   - So a common thing we see a lot of people for,
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:43.440]   it's like a day before their wedding
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.780]   or a day before a big social event
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:46.380]   and they have a zit on their forehead and they say,
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:47.620]   you know, what can you do for me?
[02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:49.160]   I need this gone.
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:52.560]   So exactly like we talked about, topical corticosteroids
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.620]   and to a greater extent injectable,
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:56.540]   intralesional corticosteroids
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.700]   suppress the immune response temporarily.
[02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:04.180]   So you can use them cautiously
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:07.300]   if you have an event within the next day or two.
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.860]   Long-term use, it causes multiple problems.
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:11.380]   It causes thinning of the skin
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:15.340]   and can increase the risk of the acne scar forming.
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:17.280]   And you can have rebound acne
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:20.720]   from topical steroids used all over the face.
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:25.580]   Oftentimes we see a lot of people who are in the public eye
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:28.420]   asking for steroid injections of their acne.
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:31.940]   I, as a surgeon, usually see a lot of the consequences
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:34.100]   of that, so I tend not to utilize
[02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.860]   steroid injections for acne.
[02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:40.660]   The reason for that is if you place just a little too much,
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:45.660]   and we're talking less than 0.1 milliliter difference,
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:50.220]   you can have a permanent atrophic divot in the skin
[02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:52.300]   that is only fixed by surgery.
[02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:54.660]   So I see a lot of young patients that come in
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:56.380]   who had an acne spot injected here
[02:29:56.380 --> 02:29:59.860]   and now that divot is left and that's permanent.
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:03.420]   If it's gonna be done, it should be done by a dermatologist
[02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:04.860]   who knows what they're doing.
[02:30:04.860 --> 02:30:07.900]   Low concentrations, usually bottom half of the face
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:11.220]   can be effective in getting rid of a really bad pimple
[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:12.580]   that needs to be gone immediately.
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:14.060]   You just gotta know the risks.
[02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:18.340]   - Assuming sterile technique
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:21.140]   and other safety measures in place,
[02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:23.820]   are tattoos inherently bad for skin?
[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:24.700]   - No, I don't think so.
[02:30:24.700 --> 02:30:26.860]   I think tattoos are an awesome form of art
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:31.100]   and I think it used to be linked to, you know,
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:33.060]   stereotypes that are no longer true.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.460]   I think the challenge with tattoos is two things,
[02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:40.460]   making sure that what is being placed underneath the skin
[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:41.900]   is not an allergen.
[02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:44.940]   We see this mostly with the reds that use cinnamates.
[02:30:44.940 --> 02:30:48.700]   They produce a lot of granulomatous reactions
[02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:50.420]   or foreign body reactions.
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:52.300]   One, making sure obviously they're using
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:54.420]   clean, safe equipment that's sterile.
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:57.260]   You know, you don't want the bloodborne pathogens.
[02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:00.100]   The real challenge is surveying for growths.
[02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:02.180]   In patients who have a lot of tattoos,
[02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:05.460]   it's hard to see small skin cancers form
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:06.860]   or changes in moles
[02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:10.020]   because usually the tattoos are of dark color.
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:12.020]   So the surveillance part
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:13.420]   becomes a little bit more challenging.
[02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:14.660]   So if you have a lot of tattoos,
[02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:16.340]   just make sure to see your dermatologist
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:17.700]   and somebody who feels comfortable
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:19.700]   and confident in screening.
[02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:21.260]   But other than that, no.
[02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:24.300]   They've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years
[02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:26.980]   and I think they're fine if done correctly.
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:31.780]   - That's a good segue into surveying for skin cancers.
[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:34.140]   Earlier, you talked about some of the more common forms
[02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:37.860]   of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma,
[02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:39.660]   basal cell carcinoma.
[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:44.660]   But then there's the one no one truly wants,
[02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:47.140]   which is melanoma.
[02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:51.420]   So I was taught to keep an eye on my moles.
[02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:52.940]   If they change, change in border,
[02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:57.340]   change in size, et cetera, to notify a dermatologist.
[02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.900]   I get my moles checked about, I don't know,
[02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:02.480]   I just had it done less than a year ago.
[02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:06.660]   But what about getting all skin checked?
[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:09.900]   I mean, what do you, this is your area of expertise.
[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:14.740]   So if you had a magic wand to help prevent skin cancers,
[02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:16.720]   what would you have people do?
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:20.380]   - That's a great, great question.
[02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:24.380]   So obviously there are many forms of skin cancer,
[02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:26.060]   but the three most common, like we talked about,
[02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:29.060]   basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:32.780]   There are other types like Merkel cell and et cetera,
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:34.240]   but they're far less common.
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:38.700]   Now, historically, melanoma has been our number one killer
[02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:43.700]   for skin cancer until about a few years ago, around 2018,
[02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:47.060]   when the Nobel Prize was won for the new drugs
[02:32:47.060 --> 02:32:49.060]   that treated melanoma.
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:52.580]   This year, we expect three times as many deaths
[02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:55.560]   in the United States from squamous cell carcinoma
[02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:58.480]   than we do melanoma, but nobody talks about that.
[02:32:58.480 --> 02:33:02.880]   We lose a patient every about 62 minutes to melanoma,
[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:06.260]   but one every 37 minutes to squamous cell carcinoma.
[02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:09.500]   First and foremost, the thing that you wanna look for
[02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:12.140]   in terms of skin cancer risk and predisposition
[02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:13.260]   is look at family history.
[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:14.860]   Your family history and your genetics
[02:33:14.860 --> 02:33:17.740]   plays the largest role in predisposition
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:19.460]   for skin cancer development.
[02:33:19.460 --> 02:33:20.940]   If you can gather a family history,
[02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:23.260]   you can understand your risk in developing it,
[02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:25.820]   and it can help dictate your screening.
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.180]   Now, if you can't get a family history
[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:28.300]   or you don't know your family history,
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:29.540]   not a problem.
[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:32.560]   Generally, we recommend an annual skin exam
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.700]   by a good, reputable, board-certified dermatologist,
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:39.020]   and that includes every square inch of your skin,
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:43.240]   including your hair between your toes in the genital area.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.200]   We can develop a skin cancer anywhere.
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.620]   Bob Marley died of a melanoma on his toenail
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:49.820]   that was thought to be a soccer injury.
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.240]   Jimmy Buffett died of a Merkel cell carcinoma,
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:55.660]   one of these rarer types that occur in sun-exposed areas.
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.360]   Anybody can get them.
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.060]   Obviously, there's predispositions
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:00.380]   in higher-risk populations,
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:03.980]   but it's such an easy, non-invasive exam to do
[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:07.180]   that everybody should get one at least once a year.
[02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:09.020]   The other reason why I bring this up
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:12.740]   is skin cancers can develop in sun-protected areas.
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:16.260]   One of the areas that I see a rapid increase
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:20.180]   in skin cancer development is in genital areas
[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:22.300]   and in the mouth due to HPV,
[02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:25.100]   and we see this a lot in younger and younger patients.
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:26.140]   Probably in the last month,
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:28.480]   I've operated on six or seven young patients
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:32.200]   under the age of 40 with squamous cell carcinomas
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:35.520]   caused by HPV in the genital region.
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:37.640]   This is obviously not sun-driven.
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:39.520]   It's not something you can put sunscreen
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.800]   or take a product to protect you from,
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.160]   but it's something that's easily monitored or surveyed.
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:47.480]   So I would say at the very minimum,
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:49.480]   get a family history or a personal history,
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.840]   get an annual surveillance exam.
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:53.600]   If you have a lot of moles,
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:56.180]   I used to direct the pigmented lesions in melanoma clinic.
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:34:58.520]   This is something that was really hard
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:02.500]   for a lot of dermatologists and patients to follow
[02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:06.180]   when they're covered with moles, see which one is changing.
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:08.380]   There are tools that can be utilized,
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:11.220]   including whole body photography, mole mapping,
[02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:13.860]   and some new AI-based softwares
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:17.140]   that basically track the moles and look for changes
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:19.460]   as you feed the software more and more pictures
[02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:20.300]   from the patients.
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:21.120]   It's fascinating.
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.380]   A lot of the stuff is developing from our,
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:24.620]   well, I should say my alma mater,
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:29.620]   but up at Stanford is these AI-based software apps
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.180]   that allow us to survey
[02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:33.220]   some of the most challenging patients.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:35.260]   So if you have a lot of moles,
[02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:38.460]   your screening may be more than once a year.
[02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:39.780]   If you have a lot of moles,
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:44.780]   you inherently have a slightly increased risk for melanoma.
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.620]   Now, we always use these terms interchangeably,
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:50.880]   melanoma, skin cancer, basal, squamous, et cetera.
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.280]   Importantly to know, for every one melanoma,
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.680]   there's 10 non-melanoma skin cancers.
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:59.680]   That's namely basal cell and squamous cell.
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:01.800]   About 5 million Americans will be diagnosed
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.600]   with one of the non-melanomas this year alone.
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:05.880]   - 5 million. - 5 million.
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:06.720]   - It's a big number.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:08.160]   - Yeah, it's about one in four.
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.640]   One in four Americans at some point in their lifetime
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:12.440]   will develop a skin cancer,
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:17.000]   encroaching one in three Americans by the end of 2030.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.280]   So it's a lot.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.560]   Majority of these are not life-threatening,
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.320]   but they're functionally and cosmetically disfiguring.
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:25.600]   They arise on sun-exposed areas,
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:27.740]   so surveillance is really important.
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:33.840]   - For the HPV that eventually becomes squamous cell,
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:39.560]   carcinoma, is the HPV vaccine effective even at older ages?
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.400]   - Yeah, great question.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:46.400]   So we are seeing HPV become a real problem
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:48.520]   in many cancers in the body,
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.040]   not just the original cervical cancer,
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.800]   which was the number one killer in young women for cancer
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.480]   until the vaccine came out,
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:58.040]   but we're seeing it now as the number one cause
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.480]   of throat cancer in young adults and sexually active adults,
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:06.240]   significantly increased risk of squamous cell carcinomas
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.520]   in sun-protected areas, immunosuppressed patients.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.520]   The vaccine, the Gardasil vaccine,
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.520]   which treats or builds immunity to HPV
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:20.160]   covers the strains that cause cancer,
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.640]   16, 18, 31, 33, and so on.
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:27.200]   I recommend anybody who is either sexually active
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:30.400]   or anybody who, in population, literally anyone,
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.480]   should get vaccinated.
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:35.480]   The new guidelines have extended the age
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:38.520]   up until I think late 40s for both men and women.
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:40.800]   It used to be only for young women
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:42.120]   because the cervical cancer risk,
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:43.600]   but now we've found that so many things
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:45.520]   are implicated with HPV
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:50.520]   that the on-label use is up to the late 40s.
[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:53.480]   So if you have any concern,
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:55.840]   I highly recommend getting the vaccine.
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.360]   - As I recall, planter's warts,
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:01.000]   which are these warts that burrow a kind of root
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.800]   into the bottom of the foot.
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:03.880]   They're very painful.
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:08.880]   That actually can be caused by HPV.
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:10.720]   It's a form of HPV,
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:12.240]   and it's not sexually transmitted.
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:14.720]   It's locker room transmitted.
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.040]   - Yeah, so HPV comes in about 200 strains
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.320]   or like 190 strains.
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.680]   Strains one, two, and four, for example,
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:24.640]   cause warts on the hands and feet.
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:27.200]   What you see like gym goers and kids,
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:28.280]   they get warts.
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:32.240]   HPV six and 11, for example, cause genital warts.
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:37.000]   HPV strains 16, 18, 31, and 33 cause cancer.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.880]   The question is when you get something,
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.480]   does it come with its brothers or its siblings?
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:45.000]   And that's the question we don't know.
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.460]   The vaccine was made to treat high-risk strains,
[02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:51.640]   but because of cross-antigenicity,
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:54.440]   we see that patients who get vaccinated,
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:56.000]   their warts go away.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.220]   And we saw this in the hospital in transplant patients
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:38:59.420]   who were covered with warts
[02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:01.960]   because of their immunosuppressed effect.
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:04.760]   When we would vaccinate them, their warts would get better.
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:05.800]   - So warts on their fingers,
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:08.000]   warts on their, planter's warts on their feet.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.120]   - Yeah, transplant patients
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.640]   and anybody who is immunosuppressed,
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:14.600]   they have a tough time fighting plantar's warts,
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:18.160]   finger warts, any sort of viral-based condition
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:20.020]   because their immune system is suppressed
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:22.120]   from medications or otherwise.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:25.340]   So they usually have a tough time fighting these things.
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:27.680]   They have a higher incidence of a lot of things,
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:30.640]   but the vaccine was cool, eradicating it.
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:32.240]   Now, I'm not saying go get a vaccine
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:35.400]   cause you have a plantar wart, that's silly and overkill.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:38.240]   Usually warts we treat with freezing
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.760]   in office procedures, easy things, but.
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:42.480]   - Plantar's warts can be burnt out.
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:45.040]   - Yeah, we burn them or freeze them or scrape them,
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:46.200]   use a little medication,
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.200]   but the vaccine does improve some of the burden of disease,
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.500]   even though it doesn't target that strain.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.600]   - Do you think soon we will be in the landscape
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:58.620]   of vaccines for all forms of skin cancer?
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:01.260]   - I think we're on the forefront.
[02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:05.780]   And the term vaccine is a really big umbrella term.
[02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:06.620]   - Loaded term too.
[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:09.060]   - Yeah, I know, it's gonna garner a lot of questions.
[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:10.780]   I think, yes, absolutely.
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:15.780]   There was a new study that showed that an mRNA vaccine,
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:19.040]   and that is already pretty controversial,
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.580]   was shown to improve melanoma survival
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:23.460]   after surgery and chemotherapy.
[02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:26.740]   So what the goal of all these things
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:29.700]   is to prime your immune system
[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:32.380]   and have the immune system know what to target.
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:34.000]   It's to teach the immune system,
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:38.900]   hey, this is bad, next time you see this, go attack it.
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:41.380]   It's like showing a bloodhound a steak
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:43.180]   and then going on the hunt.
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:45.760]   The bloodhound now knows what to scent for
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:48.100]   and what is normal and what isn't.
[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:51.220]   So the vaccines have a lot of controversial things.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:54.140]   I think for medicine and cancer biology,
[02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:55.780]   it's gonna be revolutionary.
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:58.580]   We see it for brain tumors, we see it for glioblastoma,
[02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.560]   incredible changes with dendritic cell vaccines.
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.460]   We see it for melanoma now.
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:08.460]   And in the future, it may be used for all skin cancers
[02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:12.140]   with an asterisk, depending on how much we can activate
[02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:13.700]   the immune system to target it.
[02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:19.660]   - Fascinating, and a good place for us to probably pause
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:22.860]   until the next time we have you back
[02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:25.340]   to talk about where that technology evolves.
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:28.340]   Because today you've taught us so much
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:33.020]   about skin, what it is, its anatomy, its physiology,
[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:35.700]   what it reflects in terms of our internal workings,
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:38.440]   health, or in some cases, challenges with health.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:42.180]   Talked about various conditions such as psoriasis, acne,
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:46.340]   eczema, dandruff, as it's sometimes called,
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.460]   and what we can do, the role of nutrition,
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:53.380]   avoiding certain things like excess alcohol,
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:56.860]   nicotine, et cetera, but also some of the newer
[02:41:56.860 --> 02:41:58.620]   and more exciting treatments that exist
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:00.500]   for all these conditions,
[02:42:00.500 --> 02:42:04.180]   some merely cosmetic and uncomfortable,
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:08.420]   some truly life-threatening and dangerous like melanoma.
[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:11.500]   So for all those reasons, and also for taking time
[02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:14.600]   out of your very busy clinical schedule to come talk to us,
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.600]   I really appreciate it, and I want to voice my appreciation,
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:23.280]   both for myself and for those listening and viewing.
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:25.180]   I know people will have many, many questions,
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:28.140]   so we will refer them to your social media accounts
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:31.380]   and links to your clinic and so forth
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:33.580]   so that they can have those questions addressed
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:36.740]   and who knows, maybe even get the chance to work with you.
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:38.540]   In the meantime, I just want to say thank you
[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:42.140]   for this public education gift that you've given us.
[02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:44.380]   I'm thinking about skin very differently now,
[02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:48.180]   and I plan to do and not do certain things
[02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:51.580]   in light of today's conversation, no pun intended.
[02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:53.060]   - Thank you for the opportunity.
[02:42:53.060 --> 02:42:54.860]   I'm incredibly grateful to be here.
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:57.220]   I think teaching is really important.
[02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:00.300]   Having evidence-based discussions is really important.
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:02.900]   Challenging dogma is also important,
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:05.260]   done in the right way, in the evidence-based way.
[02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:06.460]   I love what I do.
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:08.740]   I love everything about the skin.
[02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:12.700]   I love seeing patients and also challenging
[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:15.300]   the status quo on certain things.
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:16.780]   So thank you for the opportunity.
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:17.740]   It's been a lot of fun.
[02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:20.060]   There's a lot to talk about in skin.
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:22.480]   We can probably talk for a decade if you let me,
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:24.100]   but I appreciate it, thank you.
[02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:25.220]   - Well, we will certainly bring you back
[02:43:25.220 --> 02:43:27.140]   to further the discussion.
[02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:30.180]   Meanwhile, thank you ever so much, Dr. Soleimani.
[02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:31.260]   - Thank you.
[02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:33.100]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:35.340]   about how to improve and protect your skin
[02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:36.980]   with Dr. Teo Soleimani.

[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:05.340]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:07.100]   or topics or guests you'd like me to consider
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:08.640]   for the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:10.860]   please put those in the comments on YouTube.
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:12.620]   I do read all the comments.
[02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:13.760]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:14.960]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:16.580]   It's my very first book.
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:17.980]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:20.140]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:21.300]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:22.460]   for more than five years,
[02:44:22.460 --> 02:44:24.780]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:26.340]   of research and experience.
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:29.400]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:31.880]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:34.340]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:37.700]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:39.780]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:43.680]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:46.060]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:47.820]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.580]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:52.220]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:54.260]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:57.400]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:00.380]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now known as X,
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:02.240]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.800]   And on all those platforms,
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:05.960]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.460]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:08.700]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:10.820]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:12.100]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:15.380]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:16.660]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:18.420]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:19.820]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:21.820]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:22.980]   that includes protocols,
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:25.180]   which are brief one- to three-page PDFs,
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:27.440]   which summarize various things that you can do
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:28.900]   in order to, for instance,
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:31.220]   optimize neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:34.580]   or optimize your sleep, or improve dopamine regulation.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:37.260]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:39.380]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:41.260]   go to the Menu tab in the top right corner,
[02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:42.880]   scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:45.200]   and provide us your email to obtain the newsletter.
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:46.300]   And I'd like to point out
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:48.740]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.060]   Once again, thank you for joining me
[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:53.060]   for today's discussion about skin health and appearance
[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:54.860]   with Dr. Teo Soleimani.
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:56.820]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:58.720]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:01.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:03.880]   (upbeat music)
