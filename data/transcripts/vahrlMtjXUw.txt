[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening had to be found in
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   that portion of scripture that we read at the beginning, namely in the second chapter
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.240]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and emphasizing especially the eleventh verse.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.760]   The eleventh verse in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:42.400]   This is the end of the statement which we are told was made by these people who were
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.080]   gathered together from different parts of the world in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   This was the thing that amazed them and astonished them. We are told that they were all amazed
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   and marveled, saying one to another, "Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans?"
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   And how we hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born. And then they lead on
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.080]   to that statement. Here we are, they say, from different parts of the world, Parthians,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.080]   Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia, etc., etc. We do hear them speak in our tongues
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.280]   the wonderful works of God.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.120]   Now here we are looking at this record which is in this chapter of the remarkable thing
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.320]   which happened on that day of Pentecost so long ago in the city of Jerusalem. This is
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.280]   Whitsunday and it is the day on which the Church throughout the centuries has reminded
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840]   herself of this great and marvelous and notable event.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.600]   Now this one verse reminds us that one of the remarkable things in connection with that
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   happening was the way in which the apostles were given this miraculous gift of speaking
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.120]   in different languages. They were ignorant, ordinary, unlearned men, and yet here they
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   were able to speak in languages which formerly they had not known and had not been able to
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.120]   speak in. Now that is a very remarkable thing in and of itself, but that is not the thing
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.960]   to which I want to call your attention this evening. It is not that I do not believe,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.520]   that I do. It is an essential part of the record. But it is not, I say, the thing that
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.140]   I want to emphasize. I am concerned rather to deal this evening not so much with the
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.140]   miraculous way in which they were able to do what they did, but actually what they did.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   What they did was, in these different tongues, to speak forth the wonderful works of God.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.400]   Now that is, of course, the thing that is emphasized in the whole of this chapter. The
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.760]   extraordinary way of doing it is, I say, full of interest, and we must believe it and accept
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   it. But still more important is what exactly they said in this way and manner.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.240]   And fortunately for us, we have the selfsame thing laid out before us very clearly and
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   very explicitly in this sermon preached by the Apostle Peter, of which we probably have
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.560]   nothing more than an extended synopsis. But here it is, in the sermon of the Apostle Peter.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   It shows us exactly what it was that he and his fellow apostles and the others who were
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   in the upper room had been saying, the thing which had caused this amazement and astonishment
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.320]   amongst the people. Now here, I think you will all agree, we have an authoritative statement
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.000]   of the basic content of the Christian faith. And it is to that, that I am anxious to direct
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.640]   attention this evening. Alas, amidst all the many confusions that characterize this modern
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   world of ours, there is no confusion that is so regrettable and so fatal in its effects
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.000]   and results as the confusion concerning the Christian message. We cannot say this too
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.720]   frequently. The whole state of the world tonight is ultimately due to the fact that people
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.560]   are Christians. If only everybody in the world was a Christian, our world would not be as
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.240]   it is. We would not have these terrible problems on our hands. I am thinking not only of the
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   international problems, I am thinking of the problems within the nations, the godlessness,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   the vice, the evil, the insecurity of life, everything that makes life unpleasant and
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.880]   difficult for so many, all the heartache and the heartbreak that is in the world tonight,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.360]   all this according to the Bible, and this is the message of the Christian church, all
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   this is due to the fact that man is a rebel and an alien from God. And here, God has provided
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   a way to reconcile men, but men will not believe it, he will not listen to it. And very largely
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.480]   he refuses to do that because the devil has come in and has caused confusion as to what
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   this message is. The devil is always there, and his greatest object is to confuse people
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.200]   as to the nature of this Christian message. He tries, of course, to keep them from considering
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.600]   it at all, and he succeeds with large masses of people throughout the world. But if we
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.120]   do begin to take an interest, he then comes as an angel of light, and he causes confusion,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.520]   causes misunderstanding about it, makes us think that it is something that in reality
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.080]   it is not at all. And the tragedy is this evening that there is all this confusion about
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   the Christian message. Now let us be honest, let us be frank. There is much of this confusion
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.560]   in the Christian church itself, as I want to try to show you. And even a day like this
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   can be completely misunderstood and entirely misused. We must come back, my friends, to
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   the authentic records. We must preach not what we think or want to preach. We must expound
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.480]   the word. We must let it speak for itself. And that is what I am anxious to do this evening,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   because while there is this confusion with regard to Christianity and what it is and
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   what it proposes to do, there is no hope at all. Well, now, then, what is it? And I suggest
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   to you that it is here in just this one phrase. Christianity is the message concerning the
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.520]   wonderful works of God. That is what it is. Here is a perfect summary of it. You see,
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.720]   here were these people, these apostles and the others, the hundred and twenty who were
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   with them in the upper room. Suddenly the Holy Ghost came upon them and they began to
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.360]   speak. And they were not speaking gibberish. They were speaking the wonderful works of
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   God. That is always the effect of the influence of the Holy Spirit. It is he who enlightens
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   the mind and the understanding to the wonderful things of God, these wonderful works of God.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.200]   And so, filled with the Spirit, they were talking about these things. And, as I say,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.280]   they were given that further miraculous power. But this is the thing. They were giving an
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.720]   exposition of the Christian message. Then I say Peter, in his sermon, does so in a still
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.680]   planar and a more explicit and extended manner. Well, now, then, what is it? Well, the matter
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   divides itself up for us quite naturally and, indeed, quite inevitably, does it not? Let
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.480]   me just underline certain things. The first thing about the message of Christianity is
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.480]   that it is concerned about works, the wonderful works or things, if you like, of God. Now,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   this is something which is absolutely basic. If we are not clear about this, well, then
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   we must be wrong everywhere. What do I mean by this? Well, I am emphasizing it. Because,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.480]   as I say, there is so much confusion about this at the present time. This, I suppose,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.800]   of all the confusions concerning the Christian message, is the commonest and the most popular
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:48.280]   just at this moment, this period in which you and I are living. Now, then, what is the
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.320]   confusion? Well, it is a confusion which has people to believe that Christianity is primarily
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.240]   a matter of ideas, that it is a matter of teaching, it is a matter of attitude, it is
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.920]   a matter of the way of thinking. Now, I think you will agree with me when I say that that
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   is the commonest popular notion of Christianity at the present time. Now, this is quite a
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:21.760]   movement on the continent of Europe. There has been a movement, a theological movement,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.480]   on the continent of Europe now for a number of years which takes up this position. It
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:34.320]   says what really matters is the teaching in the Bible. The facts connected with the teaching
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.400]   do not matter at all. Now, you know something about this. It is not my purpose this evening
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.120]   to address you on the subject of theological movements or theological thought, and yet
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.560]   we have got to know something about these things because we are affected by them oftentimes
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.000]   quite unconsciously. You see, up until the First World War, there was the so-called higher
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.920]   critical movement. It had begun in Germany about 1840 and continued and came to this
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.680]   country, spread throughout the world. And there was a movement, a teaching, which said
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.480]   that this was just an ordinary word after all, that it must be treated as an ordinary
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.240]   word, and that this was really the record of people's experiences, religious experiences,
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   and that there was nothing miraculous, supernatural about the book. It was not something that
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.240]   was produced by the Holy Spirit and so on. That was the notion. But now the First World
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   War came, and it delivered a terrible blow to that so-called liberal teaching, that modernistic
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   teaching that had been so popular. But it was replaced by another which seemed at first
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.360]   as if it were coming back to the Bible, but it has not come back to the Bible. What it
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   says is this, that the thing that matters here is the message, and that there is much
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.520]   attached to the message in the Bible that is not important. Now, that is one of the
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.040]   movements. There is another one that goes further. You may have heard about it. Sometimes
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.360]   you will notice there is a lecture on it on the third program in the wireless or somewhere
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   like that. It is a movement which is called, by a very striking title, it is called the
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   movement for demythologizing the Bible. What does that mean? Well, it means this. It says
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.120]   people are outside the church, people are not Christian today, for this reason, that
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   the Christian message has always been tied up to a number of supposed facts and historical
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   events. And they say it is this that stands between people and believing this message.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.320]   They say the modern scientific man is not going to believe in your miracles, but your
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.440]   four Gospels are full of miracles. Now they say we must detach the teaching of Jesus from
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.280]   these reported miracles. The modern man knows too much to believe that sort of thing. He
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.320]   is scientifically minded. He cannot accept these reported miracles and events. These
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.440]   things do not happen. Now that is a sort of myth, they say. These are accretions. They
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.640]   are not essential to the message. The thing that matters is the teaching, the ethical
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.840]   way of living, the example of Jesus. Now they say we must demythologize the Scriptures,
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.160]   therefore. We must take out all these miracles, all about the virgin birth, about the reported
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.720]   miracles of Christ, the literal physical resurrection, and things like that. They say these are all
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.760]   myths. They have got a sort of truth in them, which is of value. But you must not hold on
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.800]   to your facts. Get rid of the facts. Cast them overboard. You do not believe in the
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.600]   dividing of the Red Sea any longer. You do not believe in the dividing of Jordan. All
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   that, of course, is folklore, fancy, imagination. That is not true. Now then, they say, get
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.800]   rid of all that and come with the message, the teaching, and the people will believe
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.400]   it. Now that is the popular teaching today in a land like Germany, for instance. This
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.840]   demythologizing movement is the most popular theological movement in Germany today and
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.120]   in many other countries on the continent. It is spreading to other lands. And I am here
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.800]   just tonight to show you that what we read in the second chapter of the Book of Acts
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:18.360]   of the Apostles is the exact opposite of that. The wonderful works, works, it is not a mere
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.880]   teaching. Now this is where Christianity, you see, differs from the so-called great
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.400]   religions of the world, whether you are thinking of Confucianism, or Buddhism, or Hinduism,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.020]   or any one of them. These again are reviving and are becoming popular. And there are people
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.320]   like Aldous Huxley and others, novelist philosophers, who are taking up Buddhism and so on as being
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.120]   the only hope for the world, they say. We have got to come back to the realm of the
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.200]   spiritual. But that is what they come back to, Buddhism and things like that. The Buddhist
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.760]   temple has been built in this country comparatively recently. But now I am saying, the essential
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.240]   difference between Christianity and those so-called religions is just this very point,
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.480]   that they are nothing but teachings. They are nothing but systems of thought, a mixture
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.280]   of philosophy and ethics and morality. That is what they are. Now here we are dealing
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.800]   with something essentially different. And this is not only different from the so-called
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.520]   great religions of the world, it is essentially different also from every kind of philosophy.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.680]   All forms of moral systems and ethical systems and teachings. And what is the difference?
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   Well, I say the difference is this, that this is concerned primarily with facts, events,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.600]   works, happenings, history, things that have literally taken place. Now, this whole day
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.480]   of Pentecost is one of them. You see, the day of Pentecost is not a story, it is not
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.520]   an imaginary something. It is something that literally happened when the day of Pentecost
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.820]   was fully come. Now that is history. This is something that literally happened in Jerusalem
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.880]   nearly two thousand years ago. It is as much history as the conquest of Britain by Julius
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:12.480]   Caesar. It is as much history as 1066 and all that, and William the Conqueror, and the
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.600]   date when Columbus discovered America, and the American War of Independence, anything
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.680]   that has happened in history. This is a fact. This is history. Do you know you and I would
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.360]   not be in this building tonight if this hadn't actually happened? This isn't a teaching.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.440]   This is something that is based solidly upon facts. Look at this table that is in front
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:40.320]   of us. Here is a table with bread on it and wine on it. Bread and wine, why? What is this
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.560]   table saying? What is it representing? I have already answered the question in giving my
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.800]   invitation to you to stay behind for the communion service. What are we going to do with that?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.160]   Well, the apostle tells the Corinthians that what they do is this. As often as he does
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:04.600]   it, he says, "Ye declare" what? A teaching? No, no. "Ye declare the Lord's death."
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.800]   A fact? History? An event? Something that has happened? What we are going to declare
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   here is not Jesus' teaching with regard to this, that, or the other. No, no. We are
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.600]   going to declare what happened to him. We are going to declare a fact concerning him.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.400]   We are concerned about something concrete, actual, that has happened in this whole realm
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:32.360]   and field of history. The works! And yet, you see, the Christian church so largely today
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.520]   is preaching the exact opposite. Facts, they say, don't matter. It's the teaching that
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.360]   counts. And that, I am emboldened to say, is nothing but an utter denial of the very
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.400]   foundation of the Christian faith. My dear friends, if I hadn't got facts this evening,
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.720]   I'd go out of this pulpit at this moment. This isn't an ethical society. We are not
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.600]   here just to have a little moral uplift. We are not here to cheer one another. We are
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.120]   not just here to consider a beautiful view of life. We are not just here to see how we
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   can get people to stop making these bums and put an end to war. No, no. What are we here
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:17.800]   for? We are here to declare the wonderful works, the acts of God. Events! There is no
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.760]   Christianity apart from the events. This is an historical religion. It is not a philosophy,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.080]   a point of view. It is the record of things that have been done and have happened, and
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.400]   their meaning for the souls of men. Very well. There's our first word, the word "works."
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   And oh, what a vital word it is. But come, let's look at the second. We hear them, they
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:54.800]   said, speaking in our tongues, the wonderful works of God. The works of God. And here again
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   is something that is absolutely central. There are so many who are not Christians. There
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.400]   are so many who are confused as to what it is, because they haven't grasped this second
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.600]   point in exactly the same way as they haven't grasped the first point. You see, they regard
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.560]   becoming Christian as something primarily done by men. They think that you make yourself
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:26.840]   a Christian. You make yourself a Christian by living a good life, by doing a lot of good,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:34.680]   by avoiding certain other things, by holding certain views. And in this way, you make yourself
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.000]   a Christian. That is the idea that so many have still. It's utterly amazing, but it's
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.360]   true. That is why you've got this awful confusion today. There are men who tell us quite openly
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:55.160]   and frankly that they don't believe in God, they don't believe in the deity of the Lord
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:02.440]   Jesus Christ, they don't believe in his atoning, sacrificial death. Yet we are told that they
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:08.000]   are standing for Christianity today. Why? Well, look what they do, we are told. Look
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.760]   at their lives, look at the good they are doing. If they happen to be doing great good
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.080]   in a hospital in the heart of Africa, the finest Christian of the century, though there
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:24.960]   is a denial of God as he is revealed in this book, and a denial of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.520]   If they are opposed to war, well, we are told that's the Christian spirit, they've got it.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.680]   So you see, what makes a man a Christian is that he holds these views which they regard
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.840]   as Christian. It doesn't matter that he denies these facts, these events. It is what they
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:48.360]   do. But here again we are reminded so plainly and so clearly that that is nothing but a
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:20:00.000]   denial of the very essence of the Christian faith. The wonderful works of God. How is
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.680]   it that anybody can ever read this Bible and not get hold of it? What is this book? Is
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.800]   this, as we've been told so often and are still being told, the record of men's quest
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:16.360]   for God? Oh, how men like to talk about that. Men searching for God, the quest for truth,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.720]   the quest for ultimate reality, the quest for the absolute. And man is seeking and searching,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:28.240]   trying to make his world a better place, trying to put himself right, trying to save himself.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.040]   And it's an exact denial of everything that the Bible teaches us, everything that is emphasised
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.320]   so perfectly in the verse that we are looking at this evening. What's the Bible about? Well,
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.600]   you know, the first verse in the Bible ought to have put us right on this. "In the beginning
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:57.040]   God created the heavens and the earth and all that in them is." God. And as you go on,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   it's always the same thing. It's God who acts in the Bible. What I read in the Bible is
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:09.040]   not men setting out to find God and standing on tiptoe and arriving at this or that. I
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.360]   find the exact opposite. If you take the activity of God out of this book, what have you got
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:20.600]   left? It's God acting from beginning to end. And the first thing, my dear friends, we have
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:29.000]   to realise this evening is that salvation is of God from beginning to the very end.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.080]   Did you notice how it's emphasised by Peter in this sermon? Let me note it for you. Here
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   he is in verse 22. "Ye men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.720]   of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:54.800]   you as ye yourselves also know." Now that's a striking statement, isn't it? Even the miracles
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:01.720]   of the Lord Jesus Christ were done by God. Miracles and wonders and signs which God did
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.120]   by him through his instrumentality in the midst of you as you yourselves also know.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.600]   Now there it is to start with. And of course that's not contradicting what our Lord himself
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.280]   said. He said, "It is the Father that doeth the works. I do not these things of myself,"
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.800]   he says. "The Father that sent me, he doeth the works, the works of God." But let's go
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:31.720]   on. You get it in verse 23. "Him, the Lord Jesus Christ, being delivered by the determinate
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:38.400]   counsel and foreknowledge of God." It's still God acting. Verse 24, "Whom God hath raised
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.760]   up having loosed the pains of death." God's the actor. It's God doing everything. You've
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:49.360]   got it still later on. In verse 32, "This Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.280]   witnesses." Verse 33, "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.720]   of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which ye now do see
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.000]   and hear." And finally in verse 36, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:16.480]   that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ." It's
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.080]   God acting. That's what these men were talking about. In all these various tongues, they
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:28.320]   were telling forth the wonderful works of God. God is the actor here. Salvation is of
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.640]   God. It's not men. Men can never achieve his own salvation. Do what he will. He can be
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.480]   good, he can be moral, he can be religious. He'll never make himself a Christian. Men
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.000]   cannot do anything about his own salvation. You remember the question was put to our Lord
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.400]   himself one afternoon, "Who then can be saved?" The rich young ruler had just been. A noble
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.240]   young man, a wonderful young man. Our Lord says, "You know the commandments. Have you
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.200]   kept them?" He says, "All these have I observed from my youth upwards." Then our Lord said
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.560]   to himself, "All that thou hast to give to the poor and come, take up the cross and follow
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.720]   me." And he went away sorrowful. And it was a shock to the disciples. They knew about
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.680]   this young man. He was an exemplary character. He was full of good deeds. He was highly religious,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.560]   very moral. But there he goes away sorrowful. And they went to our Lord and said, "Well,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.840]   who then can be saved?" If this man, by living the life he is living, can't be saved, who
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   can be saved? And you remember our Lord's reply, "With men it is impossible, but not
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   with God. For with God all things are possible." The wonderful works of God. My dear friends,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:48.800]   if you and I are to save ourselves, it's already hopeless. If the world and its future depends
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   upon us, it's undone. Thank God our message is, I say, not so much to tell men to save
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.560]   themselves, but to tell them what God has done about us men and our salvation. Do you
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.840]   want to know what the gospel is? Well, you will find it right at the very beginning in
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.680]   the mouth of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. This is the message. God hath
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   visited and redeemed his people. The wonderful works of God.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.520]   Well, what are they? Well, that brings us to our next word. I am dealing with the basic
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.160]   elements of Christianity this evening. It's because there's confusion on all these points
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.080]   that people are not Christian and the world is as it is. You see, there are so many who
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:38.280]   think they can save themselves and make themselves Christian. You can't. Your nationality doesn't
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   make you a Christian. There's no such thing as a Christian country. You're not born a
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.080]   Christian. Nobody's a Christian. There is none righteous, no, not one. We're all born
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.400]   in sin and shaped in iniquity. Do what we will. We can never fit ourselves to stand
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   in the presence of God. So that it isn't Christian teaching we need. It isn't the example of
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:06.160]   Jesus that we need. It isn't Jesus as the exemplar. It isn't his ethical teaching and
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.080]   the attempt to imitate Christ. No, no, that damns us, every one of us. And I, how I thank
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.040]   God that that is not the gospel this evening. This is the gospel, the wonderful works of
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   God. And I do want to emphasize this word "wonderful." There's a recent translation
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:30.960]   which translates it, characteristically, as just "great things." Great things of God.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.920]   Always reducing it. But you know the word that these people used was not just the word
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:42.360]   "great." It includes "great," but it's much bigger than "great." According to the best
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   lexicons this is the meaning of the word that they used. "Wonderful." That's one of them.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.240]   And there's a difference between a thing being great and being wonderful. You see, when it's
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.800]   wonderful there's an element of wonder in it. There's something that makes you stand
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   back as these people were amazed, astonished. You don't always feel astonished at a great
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.880]   thing, but when it's wonderful there's something more. There's something beyond. It's not greatness.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:13.440]   There's this other element, "wonderful," but listen to their other terms. "Magnificent."
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   The magnificent works of God. Would you like another? The splendid works of God. Full of
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:27.840]   splendor. You see, when you're talking about God's works, greatness is not enough. The
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.560]   glory of God is his glory. That is God's ultimate attribute, his glory. Everything about God
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   is perfect. It's absolute. There is a splendor. There is a magnificence. There is an all-mightiness.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:49.760]   Take another one, "grand." Or take a still better one, "the sublime works of God." Now,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.800]   that's the word that these people used. I'm not putting words into their mouth. This is
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:00.600]   the very word that they used, and it emends these great expressions. Cretes and Arabians,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   we do hear them speak in our tongues. The magnificent, the splendid, the sublime works
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:15.520]   of God. Now, then, that's what we're looking at. That's what Christianity is about. Christianity
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.120]   is not just a message to say, "Try and live a better life," set out imitating Christ,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.320]   or, "God is your father. He loves you. He'll forgive you. Do what you like. Everybody's
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.480]   going to heaven at the end. It's all right." No, no, my dear friends, that's not Christianity.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.240]   This is Christianity. It is the record, I say, of what God has done about us men and
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:43.160]   about our salvation. What is it? What has he done? Well, fortunately, the Apostle Peter
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.040]   tells us all about it. The first thing he tells us is this, that what God has done,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:56.040]   God decided to do before the very foundation of the world. The way of salvation is not
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:03.440]   an afterthought. This is something that God purposed and planned before the very world
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:10.600]   itself was made. Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.920]   You know, this is the great message of the New Testament. Listen to the Apostle Paul
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:23.000]   now putting the same point exactly as he writes to the Corinthians. It's the same thing. Here
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.320]   it is in the second chapter. What is he preaching? He says, "We speak wisdom among them that
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.000]   are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.360]   to naught, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   God ordained before the world unto our blood." That's it. According to the determinate counsel
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   and foreknowledge of God. Oh, the tragedy! That men are preaching salvation as something
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.200]   that you and I do, whereas the fact is that it's something not only done by God, but
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   was determined upon by God before he even made the world. The sublime works of God,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   and everything that God does is sublime. It's marvelous. It's wonderful. It has this element
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:25.800]   of glory pertaining to it. And if your Christianity isn't something wonderful and astounding
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:32.840]   and amazing and marvelous, it isn't Christianity. If you're not astonished at it this evening,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:39.960]   you've never known it. Well, what is it? Well, there it is, I say at the very beginning.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   Oh, I never tire of repeating this from this pulpit. It's as marvelous as this, that the
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.400]   Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost met together in a conference in order to plan
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:58.320]   it. And men would reduce it to the category and the level of human philosophies and ethics
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:05.320]   and morality. This is something that has been planned by the Father, by the Son, and by
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   the Holy Ghost. It's the mind of God. It's the thinking of the everlasting and the eternal.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   There is nothing more sublime than this. The glorious gospel, as Paul calls it, the glorious
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:27.280]   gospel of the blessed God. That's it. The Father, the will, determinate counsel, and
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.960]   foreknowledge of God. Well, now then, what is it? What did he plan? Well, you see, the
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   apostle again tells us that there's a good deal told us about this in the Old Testament.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:44.120]   You notice how he's already quoted the prophet Joel. People say, "What is this? What's the
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.080]   matter with these men? What's happening to them?" Some said, "These men are drunk. They're
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.680]   full of new wine. They're raving mad. They're intoxicated. Look at them. What is this?"
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.760]   "Oh, no," says Peter, "these men are not drunk. The hour of the day makes that impossible
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   without going any further." But he says, "These are not drunken, as he supposes." But this
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. Oh, what was the prophet Joel speaking about?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.960]   "Well," says Peter, "the prophet Joel foretold what's happened today and this thing that
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.440]   you're looking at now." Well, now, you see, the prophet Joel was able to do that in one
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.480]   way. Only the other prophets have done the same thing. You read Ezekiel 36, and you'll
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.920]   find another prophecy about this. You'll find it in Isaiah's prophecy. You'll find it in
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.640]   the others. How was it that the prophets were able to foretell this? There's only one answer.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.280]   God had determined it all before the foundation of the world. He knew what he was going to
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.880]   do. And from time to time, he told some of his servants what it was. He gave them a preview.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.600]   He told them to write it down to encourage the children of Israel. They were perhaps
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.480]   in captivity. They were being persecuted, and they were groaning and wondering what
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.520]   was going to happen. And God gave an insight, gave a glimpse into his purpose and plan what
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.480]   he was going to do to a prophet. And the prophet spoke it and wrote it down. This is that which
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.240]   was spoken by the prophet Joel. Predetermined, all planned out. Oh, God doesn't do things
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.560]   as afterthoughts. There's nothing haphazard about God's actions. Known unto God are all
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:16.000]   his works from the beginning to the very end. It's sublime. It's marvelous. He sees it coming.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.360]   So we are told about these prophets. And then, you see, he mentions David, you remember.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.640]   He had told David that of his lines, therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.840]   with an earth to him, that of the fruit of his lines, according to the flesh, he would
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.240]   raise up Christ to sit on his throne. Oh, we are told, don't bother about history.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.960]   It doesn't matter whether these things are true or not. The teaching is the thing that
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:46.800]   matters and the teaching remains. No, no. Christianity is based upon this that God gave
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.480]   a promise to a man like David and said, "Out of you and your lines, out of your lineage,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.560]   out of your descendants, the Messiah is going to come. The Deliverer is going to be born.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:03.880]   It's as concrete as that. Facts from beginning to end. Oh, I mustn't keep you. You read your
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.120]   Old Testament. You'll find it a way back at the beginning. God has promised that he's
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.960]   going out of the seed of the woman to bruise the serpent's head. That's going to be a
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.160]   human being. Then he picks out Abel, a man. Then he picks out Abram, another concrete
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.680]   personality and he uses him, starts a nation out of him. This is God acting, the wonderful
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.760]   works of God. Why is he doing all this? Well, he's doing this to save men. So he has to
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.520]   take Abram, turn him into Abraham, take him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, turn him into
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.400]   a believer in God from paganism. And he founds his nation. What's the nation for? Oh, ultimately
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.880]   to produce the Messiah, the Deliverer. It's all history. It's all a matter of facts.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:52.760]   And then you go on with them all, Jacob and Moses and the law given to Moses and all about
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.880]   the burnt offerings and sacrifices. What's the meaning of all this? The meaning is that
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.400]   they're all pointing forward. These are prophecies, these are adumbrations, these are the types
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:08.000]   of what's going to happen. It's God acting the whole time. And then you come to David.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.960]   Very well. The wonderful works of God, seen in the Old Testament. But all that's preparatory.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:26.120]   When the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.840]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. You notice again how it's put, don't
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:39.480]   you? When the fullness of the times had come, God. It's always God's work. It's always God's
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.800]   action. It's always God doing something. And here it is, what did he do? He sent forth
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.880]   his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. What
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.000]   am I talking about? I'm talking about that babe that was born in Bethlehem, who was named
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.880]   Jesus. Before he was born, Mary uttered her great statement, her magnificat. Listen to
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:11.440]   what she says. "Mary said, 'My soul doth magnify the Lord.'" She's understood it. She's been
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.640]   given enlightenment. She didn't at first, she stumbled, but now she's had insight. "My
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:21.320]   soul," she says, "doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.800]   For he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden. For behold, from henceforth all
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:34.960]   generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done unto me great things."
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:40.000]   It's the same word as we've got in our text tonight. Marvelous things. She used the same
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.640]   word. Magnificent things. Divine things. Things such as God always done. "He that is mighty
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:58.120]   hath done to me splendid, sublime, a sublime thing." What is she talking about? Oh, she's
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:05.720]   understood what the archangel Gabriel had said to her a few months before. He had gone
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.200]   unto her and had said, "Hail thou that art blessed amongst women," and had told her that
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.280]   a son was to be born of her, that he was to be called the Son of God, that he was to be
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.640]   mighty and of his kingdom, there should be no end. And she had stood back in incredulity
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   and had said, "How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?" "The thing is nonsense,"
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:28.000]   she said. "How can I bear a child? I'm a virgin. I'm not married. I've never known a man."
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.520]   And the archangel had said to her, "And here's the sublime thing. Here is the wonderful work
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:41.600]   of God. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. That's it. The Holy Ghost shall come upon
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.400]   thee. Thou shalt be covered by the Holy Ghost. Therefore, that holy thing that shall be born
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:38:00.160]   of thee shall be called the Son of God." Sublime, marvelous, wonderful, a virgin birth. Facts
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.920]   don't matter. Facts such as this, these are the things they're throwing overboard. They
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.440]   don't count, but these are the wonderful works of God, the sublime acts of God. A virgin
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:20.200]   shall conceive and bring forth a child. "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:33.440]   of the All-Highest shall overshadow thee." A little babe in a manger, but the Son of God.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:43.720]   Here's the sublimity, the author of life, a helpless babe in a manger, veiled in flesh,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:53.160]   the Godhead, see. Hail, incarnate deity. Are you astounded? Are you astonished? Do these
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.980]   things move you as they move these people in Jerusalem? They were filled with amazement.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.480]   These people are talking about the wonderful works of God, and they are wonderful works.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.920]   This is what the people are saying. They said, "Look here, you crucified Jesus, but you didn't
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.600]   know who he was. He's the Son of God, the Lord of glory, the author of life himself."
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:21.320]   There it is, the incarnation, the virgin birth, the abject poverty, the stable, the straw,
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:28.840]   the cattle. Yes, but it's the Son of God. Come down, soul. Here's a sublime act from
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:36.080]   the highest courts of heaven into a stable and being born in the straw and amongst the
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:43.040]   beasts placed in a manger. The wonderful, the sublime, the magnificent works of God.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.800]   Think of his poverty and his lowliness, but go on, look at his miracles. "Who is this?"
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.000]   the people kept on saying. Of course, he looked just an ordinary man. He'd been working as
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.400]   a carpenter. He'd never had training as a Pharisee, but look at him. Look what he's
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.880]   doing. Listen to what he's saying. He raises the dead. "Who is this?" "We have seen strange
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.000]   things," they said today. "Who is this that commendeth the raging of the sea and
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.520]   can quell the howling of the gale? Who is this?" There's something about him they
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.720]   can't fathom, they can't understand. He seems weak, humble, lowly, and yet there's
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.440]   a power, there's a magnificence, there's an authority in word, in action. "Who is
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:27.960]   this?" Never men speak like this, men. Oh, the sublime works of God. Here they are.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.720]   It's God who's enabling him, but wait. "Let us come to the sublimest thing of all, the
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   most wonderful thing of all. There he is nailed to a tree on a hill called Calvary." What's
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:47.080]   happening? "Oh, well," you say, "that's the end of his story, that's the end of his
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.000]   career. He's been arrested, he couldn't defend himself, he could do nothing, and in
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   utter weakness he's been put to death." Oh, my dear friend, what have you seen as
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   you look there? When you behold and survey the wondrous cross, what do you see? Is it
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.040]   just cruel men putting a very wonderful person to death? Is it just an ignorant mob not recognizing
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.840]   a religious genius or a political or a social genius? Is it a cruel world bent on war not
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   recognizing the supreme pacifist? Is that all you see?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.320]   Look again, I beseech you, and let the apostle Peter be your guide. He's standing near you.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.080]   Listen to what he's saying. He's conducting the tour. This is what he says. "Him being
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.200]   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God." That's what's happening there. It's
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.240]   God acting there. It's God who's delivered him up to that. This is deliberate. This is
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:55.600]   the thing that God had planned before the world, before time. God giving him up. God
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.800]   so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to that death on the cross. It's God doing
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.400]   it all. Oh, by the wicked hands of men, by heathen men's hands, the nails have actually
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.200]   been driven in. But it's God who's acting. It's God's purpose that's taking place there.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   It's God who's delivered him up. "But he dies and is buried in a grave. But that isn't
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:24.640]   the end, you know. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.160]   it was not possible that he should be held in of it. The sublime, the marvelous, the
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.400]   wonderful works of God, delivering up his only son to death, handing him over to cruel
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.360]   men, he being buried." Yes, but wait a minute. Listen to this. Death, that's the last enemy.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.800]   No one can conquer death. The bands of death are indissoluble. No one can ever release
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.360]   a man from death. No one's ever risen from the dead. Wait a moment. One has. That's what
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   these people were talking about. Filled with the Spirit, they were talking about the wonderful
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.920]   works of God, and this is what they said. "We were watching him dying. We saw him dead.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.840]   We saw them taking down his body and putting it in a grave. We saw them putting the stone
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.560]   and the seal and the soldiers. But he's risen. He's been with us in the room. He's spoken
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   to us. He said, 'Touch me, feel me, handle me.'" The wonderful works of God, the bands
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:23.240]   of death torn asunder, the last enemy conquered, God raising up with his almighty power his
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.840]   own son, whom he had previously handed over to death and to the grave. And then he appears
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.920]   for 40 days amongst these very people who are now filled with the Spirit, and they were
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.040]   telling the people about that, how they were together in a room once with everything locked
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   because they were afraid of the Jews. Suddenly he appears amongst them. Same body, yet different,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.920]   glorified now. And then how he took them out to a mount called Olivet outside Jerusalem
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.800]   only 10 days before. This is what they were saying. "There we were," they said, "with
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   him on the mount of Olivet, and suddenly we saw him rising, ascending into the heavens."
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:12.400]   The wonderful works of God, the ascension following the resurrection. And when he went
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.880]   back to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, and God having exalted him in
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:23.120]   this way has given to him the promised gift of the Holy Ghost. And now, they said, he
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.440]   having received the gift has sent it down upon us. That's what you're looking at. This
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.920]   is that which was prophesied by Joel. It's happened. He's done it. He has shed forth
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:40.360]   this which you now both see and hear. The Holy Ghost has been sent to convict the world
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   of sin and of righteousness and of judgment. That's what Christianity is, my friends.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:55.740]   That is the message of the Christian faith. Before I ask you to do anything, I'm asking
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:01.160]   you to consider these wonderful works of God. Can you conceive? Of course you cannot conceive
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:08.160]   of anything more sublime. There is nothing. This is the act of God. Look at it. Incarnation,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.800]   virgin birth, that perfect life, the miraculous power, the hiding of the Godhead and yet the
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   revelation, this paradox that no mind can ever unravel. God giving up his only begotten
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   son to death and then raising him mightily, victoriously from death in the grave and lifting
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:38.600]   him up to heaven and giving him the gift of the Spirit. The wonderful works of God. What's
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   it all about? What's it mean? Well, here is the thing that matters. That is God making
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:52.960]   a way of salvation. That's what it means. God has done all these things for us. He has
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.560]   done all these things in order to make it possible for us to be forgiven and to become
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   his children. Listen. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:18.960]   their trespasses. That's it. God has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   we might be made the righteousness of God in him. My friend, if God hadn't done these
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:36.160]   things, there'd be no forgiveness for anybody. God because he's God can't just look at us
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:42.840]   and say, "I forgive you." God is holy. God is righteous. God is just. God can't deny
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:48.920]   himself and his own holy nature. God must punish sin. I say it with reverence. If God
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.720]   didn't punish sin, he wouldn't be God. God and sin are eternal antitheses, and God
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:47:00.720]   has told us that sin is to be punished. This is where the sublimity of the Acts comes in.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:12.600]   There was only one way which even God could find whereby a single soul should be forgiven.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   It's the way I've been describing to you. God sending his own Son, and the Son coming,
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:28.800]   humbling himself, entering into the Virgin's womb, being born as a babe in poverty and
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.040]   helplessness, living as he did, yet dying. Oh, my dear friend, can't you see the sublimity
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.600]   of the thing? That God so loves you and me, rebels, fools, sinners that we are, hell-deserving
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.080]   as we are. He loved us to this extent that he's taken your sins and mine and has put
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:54.040]   them on his own Son and punished them there, punished him for us, that we might be forgiven,
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:59.400]   that he might reconcile us unto himself. It's God doing it from beginning to end, the wonderful
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:05.600]   works of God. So that all you and I have got to do is this. It shall come to pass that
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. That's how you're saved. Not
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.360]   by living a better life, not by joining a church, not by refusing to do this and that,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.280]   not by being against war. No, no. In your utter helplessness, in your lost condition,
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:28.480]   you just call on the name of the Lord. You can't do any more. But thank God that's all
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   you need to do. It's all been done. Salvation is of the Lord. It's of God. He's done it
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.160]   all in Christ. There's nothing left for you or for me to do, but we couldn't do it even
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.720]   if there were. We are simply asked to realize our need to repent. Here it is. Let me give
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.160]   the apostles words. These people listening to this sermon under the power of the Spirit
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.680]   cried out and said, "Men and brethren, what shall we do? We've killed the Messiah. We've
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   crucified your Son. What shall we do?" And Peter answered, "Repent and be baptized every
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." You and I have nothing
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:18.680]   to do except to realize our terrible sinfulness. We've got to realize that our sin is such
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:24.240]   that nothing we can ever do about it will avail at all, that there is only one thing
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:30.160]   that could deliver us. It's the thing that God has done, that Christ has died for us.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:36.800]   Believe on him just as you are. If you say, "Oh, yes, but give me a little time. I want
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.300]   to live a better life." Well, you've denied it all. You've got to take this as a free
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.360]   gift from God. This is justification by faith only. You mustn't do anything. You try and
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.640]   add anything. You've canceled it all. This is the free gift of God's grace. It's the
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:54.680]   wonderful works of God. He's done it all. Salvation is complete. Christ on the cross
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   said, "It is finished," and it was. Nothing more to be done. He has drunk that cup to
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.240]   the very dregs to the bottom. He's paid every item in the bill that's against you. There's
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.400]   nothing left. He doesn't need any assistance, and there's no one who can give him any. It
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.800]   is finished. He trod the winepress alone. He has completed the work which God has sent
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.920]   him to do, the wonderful works of God.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   And all you and I need to do is to realize our utter absolute need of this, and receive
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:36.360]   it and accept it. Not a teaching, not a philosophy, not an ethical, moral way primarily. All that
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:43.360]   follows. No, no. The first thing is this, that we are lost, that we are so lost that
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.920]   nothing any man can ever do can save us, that God alone can save. So we cry as we are, and
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   we are. Nothing in my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling. Naked come to thee for
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:07.720]   dress, helpless look to thee for grace. Foul I to the fountain fly, wash me, Savior, or
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:14.880]   I die. Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws, demands. Could my zeal, no, respite,
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   no. Could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone. Thou must save, and thou
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   alone. Call on the name of the Lord. Cry out unto him. Oh, how we should thank God that
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:35.640]   this is the way of salvation this evening. What if it did depend on us? What if it did
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:40.680]   depend upon our understanding, and our grasp of philosophy, and our good works, and our
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:45.920]   good deeds? Where would we be? We'd all be utterly lost, for we are helpless, we are
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   hopeless, we are vile, our very natures are fallen. Thank God it isn't that. The message
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:52:02.240]   tonight is the same message as it was on the day of Pentecost at the beginning. In my feeble
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   way, but I trust the Spirit has been using my lisping, stammering tongue. It's the same
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:18.320]   thing. The wonderful works of God. And have you seen them, and have you felt them? Have
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.240]   you been staggered by them? Have you ever known in any shape or form what it is to cry
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.840]   out, saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Do you really believe that God has
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.920]   so loved you that he sent his only Son from heaven and its courts into this world for
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:42.920]   you, and that Christ and the cross was dying for you and for your sins? Have you said,
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:49.960]   "Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all." Have you said, "When
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:58.200]   I survey the wondrous cross." Have you seen the marvelous, the sublime, the beautiful,
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   the glorious character of all these acts, these deeds of God? If you have, you're a
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:11.080]   Christian. If you haven't, my dear friend, whatever you are, I don't care, you're not
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:16.680]   a Christian at all. If you think you've contributed anything to your salvation and to your becoming
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:23.320]   a Christian, you're not a Christian. You're a beggar. You've got nothing. There is none
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:29.000]   righteous, no, not one. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. If you've
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.280]   got anything in your hand as you're facing God now, you don't know him. You're not a
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:40.280]   Christian. Salvation is entirely the free gift of God. It's been made possible by the
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:48.680]   wonderful works of God in Christ and brought to us by the light and the illumination and
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   the power and the conviction of the blessed Holy Spirit. Have you seen it? Have you realized
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:07.680]   the wonderful works of God and that they were done for you? If you haven't, my dear friend,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:15.400]   call on the Lord. Cry unto him. Ask the Spirit to open your eyes and to give you understanding.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.640]   There is no other way of salvation. There is none other name under him given amongst
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:27.640]   men whereby we must be saved. It is in Christ and him crucified and in him alone. Amen.
