[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   In this video, I'm going to walk through an example report in Weights and Biases and show you how to create one yourself.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Our gallery page is a showcase of some of our favorite reports written by both people here at W&B and people who are using our product.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Let's take a look at this report by Jonathan King.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Here he discusses how to detect protein structures and have a model fit these 3D proteins.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   This report has several elements worth mentioning.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   The star button allows you to select reports that you like and want to bookmark.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   These will show up on your profile under stars.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Jonathan uses both markdown and visualizations to tell a story.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And you can see here that he's used LaTeX in the markdown and we display it correctly.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   In this case, he's pulling in visualizations from Weights and Biases and sharing the process he used to build this model.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   One of the greatest things about reports is that it allows you to share interactive media.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   In this case, he's shared some 3D models of protein structures.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So here, red is the prediction and blue is the ground truth.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So the red is trying to be as close as possible to fitting the blue.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   He's also including some grouped runs.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   This allows you to see the min, max, and mean of a group of runs in this report.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   The parameter importance panel allows you to pick the metric you care about
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and then identify how much of an effect different hyperparameters have on that metric.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   The magic wand shows recommended parameters that have some variance across runs.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And here, it looks like the number of parameters and trainable parameters have a high negative correlation with this metric.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Run Compare filters down to just the different hyperparameters across runs.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Here, he has three runs selected in this section, so you can see these six hyperparameters are different across these runs
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and he's able to filter down to those easily.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   To create a report from an existing project, we're going to select Export this section to a report.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We'll rename the title and add a description.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And you'll be able to see that here in the list.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Until it's saved, it will remain a private draft, so no one else can see your drafts until you save a report.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Let's say we want to add a description at the top.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So I'll select Add Section Above.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That gives me a new run set to control this section.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We'll rename this section Introduction.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And we'll add a markdown panel, which gives me space to add text.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So now if I save this report, there's a markdown section displayed and then my visualization.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You can change the edit permissions on this report by selecting the Share button.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Right now, only I can edit this report.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   If I wanted to send this link to someone and give them edit access, I would select Anyone with Right Access to this Project Can Edit.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Reports are scoped to the privacy of the project.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   If you want to publish a report from a public project, all you have to do is share the URL.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You can download the LaTeX file, which downloads a zip file with text and images that you can upload to something like Overleaf to edit.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Select Clone to make a fork of a report and make some edits and tweaks or repurpose an existing layout.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And that's the basic rundown of reports.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   If you have any questions or cool projects to share, send us a note using the chat window on the bottom right side of our website.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Thanks for watching!
