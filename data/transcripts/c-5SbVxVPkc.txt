[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   The biggest change is going to go on offense.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.240]   Let's say you do okay at work meetings, but you want to just like own the room.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.000]   You want to be like a powerful force of leadership and speaking up and authority.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   So then you say, okay, I'm going to have a commitment.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.580]   Like every single meeting, I'm going to intentionally speak up and I'm
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.940]   going to intentionally steer at once.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.420]   I'm going to intentionally ask a question.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.120]   And so you start to build that.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.520]   That's the action side.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.580]   Now the habit that really strengthens that, and it serves multiple purposes.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580]   It neutralizes the critic and it builds your optimal coach.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   And this one is right after the meeting is done.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   Don't just do it in your head, force yourself to do it on a note file on your
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.440]   phone or on a sheet of paper where you write down three wins from
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.640]   the meeting right afterwards.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.200]   What are three things that you did that went well?
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.460]   You might say, nah, nah, I don't need to do that.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.520]   I know I was fine.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.120]   It went great.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.440]   No, no, no.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.640]   This is going to really encode it into your, your identity.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.720]   And it doesn't matter what you write down.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.360]   It matters that you're training your brain to say, Hey, when I go into
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.000]   these situations, I'm competence.
