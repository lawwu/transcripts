[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to optimize
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   every aspect of my life.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.920]   When it comes to the big decisions about money, how you invest your savings has
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.840]   to be one of the biggest questions we all face, and honestly, one of the most
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.320]   important.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.360]   So I wanted to do an episode all about investing, and I couldn't think of anyone
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.120]   better to join me than Andy Ratcliffe.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   Andy is the co-founder and CEO of Wealthfront, an investing app that makes
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.200]   it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth with over $27 billion in assets.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920]   He also serves as the chairman of the Endowment Investment Committee for the
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.520]   University of Pennsylvania and is a member of the faculty at the Stanford
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720]   Graduate School of Business.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.280]   Prior to Wealthfront, Andy co-founded Benchmark Capital, arguably one of the
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   most successful venture capital firms of all time, with their first fund returning
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   92 times the original investment.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.440]   In fact, Andy is so impressive that after meeting him and learning about Wealthfront,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   I decided to shut down my last startup, Grove, and join Wealthfront with a handful
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   of the people from our team.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.480]   In this episode, we'll talk about how you should be investing to build your wealth.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   We'll take a look at the mistakes so many people make investing.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.240]   We'll talk about how investing should or maybe shouldn't change as you make more
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.000]   money, and Andy will give you his take on why he thinks many of you should stop
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   contributing to your 401(k).
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.800]   Finally, just to clear up any conflicts, I am an employee and shareholder of
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.160]   Wealthfront, and Andy is my indirect boss.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.760]   But Wealthfront didn't pay me to be here, and this podcast is completely mine, so
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.560]   all of the opinions I express are solely my own and do not reflect the opinion of
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.000]   Wealthfront.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   As always, this podcast is for informational purposes only, should not be relied upon
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   for investment decisions, and all investing involves risk.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.560]   So without further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with the one and only Andy
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.040]   Radcliffe.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.640]   Andy, thanks for being here.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.200]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   Yeah, so the common thread on your resume is investing, and so I'd love to start a
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.240]   conversation about your journey investing and go back as early as it was when you
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.640]   made your first investment.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.560]   Well, that's actually, I think, an interesting story.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.200]   I knew nothing about investing.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.360]   I had no interest in it.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.600]   No one in my family had ever worked in the investment industry or had any
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.480]   sophistication around it, but I went to Wharton as an undergraduate student, so
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.880]   University of Pennsylvania's business school as an undergraduate student.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   I also spent my time in the engineering school, but the most interesting course
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   that I took at Wharton was the first business simulation course.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.880]   Basically, the professor had come up with a way to simulate the financial
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.520]   performance of companies that competed with one another.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.480]   So to take the course, you were split into teams of four, and each week you had to
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.960]   make 26, something like 26 decisions, as did all of the other teams in the class.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   So you had to make decisions like how much money were you going to raise?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.480]   How much manufacturing capacity did you want to build?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   How many units would you build?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.600]   What would you price them at?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   How much money would you spend promoting them?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.560]   So you had to go through all of these inputs, and they were all fed into a
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   model, and out would come a financial statement, a balance sheet, and a stock
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.760]   price.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.840]   I was absolutely captivated by this, and about two or thirds or three quarters of
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.320]   the way through the course, I started to wonder, I figured out what the algorithm
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   was for success, and I wondered, "Huh, I wonder if you applied what the model
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.960]   looked for in companies, would that lead to good investment performance?"
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.720]   Remember, this is circa 1978, and what the course really promoted is that
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.920]   companies should focus on high growth.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.880]   They should focus on market share.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.440]   You price low to get share, and then once you have the share, you can raise
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.320]   price to earn higher margins.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.000]   So it really looked for companies that built high return on equity and high
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.600]   operating margins, but first and foremost, high growth.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.320]   And so I looked for companies that had high growth and high return on equity
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.040]   and high margins, and lo and behold, they were all tech companies.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   So I built a simulated portfolio of the companies that matched what the simulator
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.040]   in the course looked for, and they did really well over six months to a year.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   So I convinced my father to give me a couple thousand dollars to invest in a
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   couple of companies that best fit the model, and they did exceptionally well.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.240]   And I continued to follow this model for quite some time, and I ended up paying
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.280]   for my graduate school education this way.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.240]   Wow.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   So that's how I became an investor.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   I had never had any intent to do so, but from this course really inspired me.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.040]   I became a TA of the course, and I just fell in love with it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   And did you know at that point that this would probably make
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.560]   up the rest of your career?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.400]   No clue whatsoever.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.680]   As a matter of fact, quite the contrary, because my dad had a
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.840]   small manufacturing business.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.200]   He was an entrepreneur, and my intent in going to an undergraduate business
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.080]   school was to join him on graduation and work in his company, and I thought I was
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.120]   going to go work in the family business, the very small family business, but I was
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.040]   so captivated by this that a couple of weeks before I graduated, I decided that
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   I wanted to go out on my own, so I worked in investment banking for a couple of years.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.640]   So as I said before, I had a background in finance and computer science, so I
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   first sought a job in computer science in New York, so I grew up about 25 minutes
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.480]   outside of Manhattan and had always wanted to live in New York, and so I looked for
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.760]   a job when I graduated in software development, but they were all time
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.960]   sharing bureaus that served financial services companies, and they all treated
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.760]   their programmers, as they then called them, like crap, and I thought, "I don't
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.360]   want that job," so I got a late start on looking for a job on Wall Street, so I
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.440]   got a job working in mergers and acquisitions for one of the top five
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.880]   investment banks, and as luck would have it, they were very early on in
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.560]   representing technology companies, and I was the only person in the department who
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.880]   actually knew what the companies did, so I got exposure that I never should have
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   gotten. Meanwhile, I continued to hone my skills investing, and I learned about
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   venture capital in my first year out of college, and I thought, "God, that's the
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.680]   coolest job ever." It combined computer science, which I loved, with
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.400]   entrepreneurship, which I appreciated from my dad, and investing, and so I had
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.040]   become friendly with someone who also worked as an analyst on Wall Street who
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.920]   wanted to work in venture capital, and he said, "We've got to go to Stanford.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.240]   That's how we're going to get into this industry," and that's how I ultimately
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.360]   applied to Stanford Graduate School of Business, got in, and it changed my career.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.720]   Wow, and so did you know throughout Stanford that venture capital was the
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.760]   end goal after graduation? Absolutely. I knew I wanted to get involved as soon as
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.200]   I possibly could, and I had a lot of really lucky breaks along the way. The
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.600]   fellow who ran the M&A department at my firm before business school was a
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.920]   Stanford grad, and his son was a year ahead of me in business school, so he
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.600]   took me under his wing when I got to Palo Alto, and his best friend was the
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:47.960]   son of the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, which was the Google of its day, and he
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:54.160]   worked for the Premier Seed Fund before that was a real thing, and this fellow,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.600]   Greg Young, for some reason took a liking to me. We had great chemistry, and he
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.200]   introduced me around to a bunch of venture capital firms to see if I might
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.720]   be able to get a part-time job while I was going to business school, and he
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.520]   ultimately introduced me to the first crossover firm that invested in
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.440]   late-stage private and early-stage public companies. And after this
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   successful career for multiple decades, building one of the most well-known and
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.760]   best-performing funds, you got to a point where almost anyone would retire and
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.320]   just stop, and you did what is maybe the complete opposite of retirement, and
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.880]   decided to go start a company, which I have done and is a lot of work, and, you
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.920]   know, I'm not sure I would think that would be...
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.800]   Unclearly not that intelligent, Chris.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   But you decided to start a company in the investment space. What did you think
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.720]   people were doing wrong that drove you to start Wealthfront?
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.840]   Sure. Well, contrary to what most people think, great companies are not started as
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.720]   the result of an entrepreneur saying, "I want to start a company, so I'm going to
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.600]   go find the best opportunity I can and then do that." And typically, it's
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.640]   described as... The process is described as someone who looks for a market that
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.400]   has a problem, and then you develop a solution for the problem, and that's how
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.440]   you get started. Those kinds of businesses lead to very mundane and small
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.840]   outcomes. The really great successes in venture capital are the result of an
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.280]   entrepreneur recognizing an inflection point in technology that allows them to
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   build a new kind of product, and then they try to find a market for that
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.320]   product. So, it's the exact opposite of what you think it is. I had absolutely no
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.880]   desire to start a company. So, I didn't know what I wanted to do, but when you've
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   been successful and you retire, it's amazing how many interesting things find
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.600]   you. Now, I was focused on giving back because I have a life beyond anything
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.040]   that I ever imagined, so I wanted to give back. So, I became a trustee at my
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   undergraduate alma mater, Penn. I started teaching, which I still do, at my grad
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:18.600]   school alma mater, Stanford, and my wife and I started an innovative cancer
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   research funding initiative. So, I wanted to give back to society, and one of my
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.840]   responsibilities as a trustee at Penn was to sit on their endowment investment
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.080]   board, and the premier university endowments are the best managed diversified
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.360]   pools of capital in the world, and they all invest very similarly. And it struck
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.880]   me when I went to a meeting, one of my first meetings, that a lot of what they
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.800]   did was manual and spreadsheet-based, and that there were some APIs that had been
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.640]   created in the brokerage world that would allow you to build an automated
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.920]   investment service. And this was interesting to me because when I was a
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.240]   venture capitalist, a lot of the people that I recruited that went on to
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.760]   financial success would come to me for investment advice, and I could never tell
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.480]   them to do what I do, because they couldn't afford the minimums. And so, if
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   one were to basically do an 80/20 on the endowment investment model and automate
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:20.080]   it, you could make really sophisticated investing available to the masses. And so,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.880]   I felt like I needed to do it for social good, not because I wanted to build a
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.400]   business out of it. And I thought, "Oh, if it works, I'll just hire a CEO, and I'll
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.560]   be a board member." So, I never intended to run the company.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   And yet here you are.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   And yet here I am.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.280]   And so, when you thought about that original kind of moment of, "Okay, let's
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.800]   build an 80/20 version of the endowments," what does that mean? What types of
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.360]   investments did you think people needed to have in their portfolio, and what did
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.960]   you want to build there?
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.440]   Well, like almost every successful company, we pivoted from where we
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.200]   started. So, the original insight from endowment investing was that university
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.920]   endowments are really good at picking managers that are likely to outperform
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:12.560]   the market. Now, this might sound like heresy coming from a guy who co-founded a
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.960]   company that built much of its reputation on passive investing. But there is a
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.560]   small percentage of managers out there that consistently outperform the market,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.120]   and the endowments are really good at finding them. And they do it in a very
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.720]   similar way, and that is basically they look for managers who have a pretty long
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.000]   track record of outperforming, but who have done so consistent with their stated
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.160]   strategy. And that's the hard part.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.360]   So, that's how we started, was we built a marketplace of investment managers, and
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.120]   the managers that we chose over a year and a half outperformed the market by 4%
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.720]   net of fees, which was the good news. The bad news was nobody cared, because it was
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.920]   too inconvenient. We were really only choosing managers that were ideal
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.040]   representatives of your U.S. equity allocation, and U.S. equity should be
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.920]   about a third of your portfolio. So, it was really inconvenient, because you had
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.760]   to take care of investing in non-U.S. equities and in bonds. So, the refrain
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.040]   that we would often hear from people is, "I'd rather that you manage all of my
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   money adequately and inexpensively than a portion of it superbly." And that's when
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.880]   we pivoted into a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.920]   And how did you decide what kind of asset classes people should be investing in?
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.440]   The mix of asset classes is an incredibly well-understood problem, the
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:56.080]   solution to which was invented, I think, in 1958 and won the Nobel Prize in 1990,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.040]   called the Modern Portfolio Theory, or the Capital Asset Pricing Model. So,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.720]   there's no rocket science associated with this. This is real commodity
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.480]   technology. It's just applying a computer to do it instead of a person.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   And do you think that, for most people, it's a better approach to be passive and
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.440]   hands-off than to try to, you know, pick stocks?
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.640]   The academic research on this is unbelievably clear and consistent. So,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   this reminds me of climate change, that 98% of scientists or more believe in
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:43.880]   climate change. The problem is that when news channels put together a debate,
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.280]   they only have one person representing each side, which makes it seem like it's a
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:56.000]   50/50 argument. But in the scientific community, it's 98 to 2. Well, the same
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.040]   goes for active versus passive investment, that it is almost impossible net of fees
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.440]   to outperform the market over the long term. You know, only a third of
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.600]   professional investment managers outperform the market in any one year.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:22.400]   After 10 years, it's less than 15%. So, what makes you, as an amateur,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.560]   think that you can do this if you're not spending all of your time trying to find
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.600]   companies that are likely to beat their expectations? The fact that you like the
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.160]   company or not is nothing to do with whether or not the stock price is going
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.040]   to go up. It's deciding whether or not you think the company's earnings are
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.560]   going to be in excess of the expectations or not. And that's really hard to do and
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.200]   something that amateurs, including myself, shouldn't be doing.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it. Life comes at
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.800]   you fast. But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.920]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.960]   easy way and let our sponsor, Drizly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.280]   of the supplies. All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.640]   It doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.280]   another week. With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.760]   your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.840]   houses without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.800]   across multiple stores. So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.880]   were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.760]   in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.640]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:08.280]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y dot com today. Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.160]   And so, does that mean there's, you know, not a place for buying stocks in
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.600]   someone's investment portfolio and that most of the people that are doing that
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   should be really passive investing with everything, or how do you think about
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.200]   that mix?
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   Well, what they should be doing, or what they, the problem here is the data's
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:35.680]   really clear that unless they have a really unique and unfair insight, they
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.920]   should not be picking stocks. Now, academics believe that the only way that
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:48.480]   one can outperform the market is if you have an information advantage.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.760]   And they further believe that the only information advantages are illegal.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.800]   I don't believe that. I actually think that some people are better at
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   interpreting signal than others through experience. So, there are a small number
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.800]   of investors who are outliers, who are able to outperform the market, not every
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.760]   single year, but over the long term. I think there are very, very few amateur
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.600]   investors who are able to do this. The fact that you did well one year doesn't
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.760]   mean that you were really good. You know, one of the biggest mistakes people
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.360]   make is confusing absolute returns with relative returns. So, for example,
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:40.160]   Robinhood made a statement that their average customer from April 1st, 2020 to
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   March 31st of 2021 saw an increase in their portfolio value of about 30%.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.360]   So, those people thought they're brilliant because if you could make a 30%
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.840]   return, you must be brilliant. Only problem is the S&P 500 was up 55%.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   So, you lost 25% relative to having bought the index.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.720]   Now, when the market's only up 5%, those people are going to be down 20%.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.920]   They don't realize it, but that's what's going to happen to the vast majority of
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.600]   them. You know, you wouldn't think about picking up a scalpel and operating on
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.280]   your friends. Why would you think that without training, you can invest like the
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:30.000]   best professionals? You can't. It's an apprenticeship business. Now, there might
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.040]   be a few outliers out there who could do it. So, all that being said, to me,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:43.680]   investing is like a diet, that you're unlikely to just invest passively because
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.280]   it's really boring and you hear your friends talk about the stocks they bought
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.880]   and how well they did. So, my thought is, encourage people to buy a few stocks
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.440]   with less than 10% of their net worth to learn that they really don't know what
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.760]   they're doing. So, even if they lose some money, it's okay, or if they
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.600]   underperform the market, it's okay. But if you tell people you should only invest
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.240]   in passive, they're not going to live up to that diet because it's too boring.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.360]   So, I'm in a really fortunate position that I have access to some of the best
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.280]   venture capital firms in the world, some of the best hedge funds in the world,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.800]   because they want access to my network and my experience. If I didn't have
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.720]   access to those people, all of my money would be in a passively-managed,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.560]   diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   - I know a lot of people that have heard venture capital startups growing and
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.880]   decide they think they want to start angel investing. Do you think that is a
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.000]   similar strategy to stocks that people are going to help with?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.280]   - It's even worse. The data shows that it's even worse. So, what's really
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.520]   consistent is that the top 20 venture capital firms generate on the order of
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:08.560]   95% of the realized returns of the industry. Now, many people confuse these
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.880]   numbers by looking at the unrealized returns, which are irrelevant. All that
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.200]   matters is that the return ultimately gets realized. So, you can have really
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.480]   high unrealized returns if you invest in a company, and then the next round they
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.280]   get valued at $300 million and then at a billion dollars. But unless the company
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.760]   ultimately gets acquired or goes public at a valuation in excess of a billion
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:39.120]   dollars, that's not worth anything. So, about 3% of the venture capital firms
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:46.960]   generate 95% of the industry's realized returns. That says that 97% of
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:56.000]   professional venture capitalists are horrible at what they do. 97% of people
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.880]   who do this for a living are horrible at what they do. So, again, what makes you
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:09.040]   think, as an amateur, that you are going to generate great returns? Look, might
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.840]   you luck into one or two of them? Yeah. But you're not going to do it
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.960]   consistently, so you shouldn't try. I wrote an article about this for Tech
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.840]   Crunch a number of years back, where I say you shouldn't do it, but you're not
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.360]   going to listen to me, so keep it to under 10% of your liquid net worth.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.640]   Yeah. So, it sounds like the common theme is small amounts to feed that
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.880]   excitement. But if you want to increase the likelihood that your money will grow
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.560]   in the best way possible, passive investing, even if it's boring.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.600]   You know, it's really funny. Our chief investment officer is the guy who
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.960]   invented passive investing, the father of that passive investing, Burt
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.000]   Malkiel, an emeritus professor at Princeton, who started this whole thing
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.840]   off with his book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street. About a year into Wealth
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.600]   Front's starting, or a year into offering a diversified passive portfolio, we
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.840]   recruited him to be our chief investment officer. And soon thereafter, we held an
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.320]   event in Palo Alto for our local clients where they got to meet Burt and ask him
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   questions. And one wise guy raised his hand and said, "Burt, do you own any
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.600]   stocks? Because here's the guy who really believes in index investing." And
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.520]   Burt had a cute little grin on his face and he said, "Yes, and I also like going
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:40.800]   to the dog track. I find them both very entertaining." So, even Burt does it,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.560]   but he does it for entertainment and with a very small percentage of his
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:52.640]   net worth. I haven't bought an individual stock in 15 or 20 years. And I was a
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.160]   really good public investor.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.080]   What made you stop?
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.760]   I don't have the time to do it. If I don't do a bunch of surgeries, would I
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.440]   operate on someone? No.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.560]   Yeah. You know, there are experts that pick stocks. There are experts that
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.160]   buy art. So, the platforms that let you invest in those, my general rule has
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.560]   been similar to yours, which is it's probably not the best place for returns
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.880]   if they're coming to me because I have not as much money as most people and
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.680]   don't know what I'm doing. And it probably seems like the reason they're
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.040]   coming to me is for exactly those reasons that I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.440]   I think Warren Buffett said something like, "If you're really good at
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:40.400]   investing, why would you share your ideas? Why wouldn't you get some other
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.280]   people's money so you could buy more of those ideas?"
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.880]   Yeah. That always set me off with some of the platforms that let you
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.080]   crowdfund large investments, which is if these are such great investments,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.320]   aren't there institutional capital that would fund them? And am I just the
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.840]   sucker? But there is one asset that I think a lot of people I talk to believe
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.200]   is different, which is real estate. And I meet plenty of people who think
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   the way to save for the future is not to invest in the stock market, but to
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.600]   buy real estate, whether it's for rentals or for flipping. Do you think
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.320]   real estate fits in someone's, not investment portfolio, but savings plan
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.040]   for their future?
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   You know, I've heard that over and over and over again, and we get that
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.000]   feedback a lot from our clients at Wealthfront. I actually wrote a blog
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.840]   post that showed how the numbers work for buying rental properties. And what
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.760]   most people don't realize is that if you buy a rental property for the
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.520]   first at least five years or maybe even 10, you're going to have negative
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.840]   cashflow. So it's not really an income property that if you have to borrow
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.440]   the money to buy the property, if you look at the all in costs, they're
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   likely greater than the rents that you're going to earn. And it's going to
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.440]   take a while for the rents growing at inflation to catch up to your expenses.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.040]   Now, maybe you were fortunate that you bought it in an up and coming
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.760]   neighborhood and you're able to significantly increase your rents. But
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.880]   then that means that you're an expert at identifying neighborhoods that are
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.120]   going to change. So to me, that is completely analogous to picking
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.320]   individual securities. And if you don't do that for a living, what makes you
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.400]   think that you're going to be better at it than the people who are doing that
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   for a living? There are many people who do nothing but look for properties
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.600]   that are likely to appreciate at a very rapid rate so that they can increase
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:56.080]   the rents. So I don't understand why people would go out and try to buy
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.120]   properties. To me, it's the same as buying stocks. Better to invest in a
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.760]   diversified pool like a real estate investment trust or something of that
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.960]   sort. And one thing I often remind people that are asking me similar
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.440]   questions is that people often don't factor in the down payment. They say,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.040]   "Well, the rent is going to pay for the mortgage." And even if it covers all
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.360]   the HOA fees and the property tax, that down payment would have otherwise
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.880]   also been earning a return in the market. And at a minimum would maybe have
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.480]   some dividends that would count as cash flow that they forget. And they say,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.960]   "Well, they're just looking at the mortgage payment. They're just
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.320]   comparing that to the rental income and forgetting that maybe they had to put
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.440]   $50,000 or $100,000 down." And they don't have the insurance payments
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.480]   built in. They don't have the real estate taxes. They don't have
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.240]   maintenance. There's all sorts of things that they leave out of the
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.720]   equation that we put into the blog post that explained. And I even shared
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.240]   the spreadsheet where I did all the calculations so people could play with
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   their own numbers. It is really, really difficult to generate positive cash
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.680]   flow from a supposed income property.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:11.040]   Yeah. So, when I started this show called All the Hacks, the idea was to
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.160]   find kind of the extra optimizations that can help you earn more and upgrade
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.840]   money and life. And the strategy of passive investing maybe doesn't feel
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.600]   like that. But there are some investment, what I'll call hacks, that I'm
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.920]   curious which of or if any of them you think are actually opportunities for
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:35.200]   people. So, are things like tax loss harvesting or pre-tax retirement
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.600]   accounts or direct indexing, are any of those things that might kind of give
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.680]   you an edge in the long run that might be viewed as kind of an optimization
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.080]   or a hack that many people aren't taking advantage of?
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   Well, I'm going to quote Burt Malkiel again, who loves to say, "You can't
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:58.000]   outperform the market, so you shouldn't try. Better to buy index funds and
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   focus on the three things over which you do have control." And they are
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.440]   diversification, which he calls the only free lunch in investing, minimizing
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.520]   fees and minimizing taxes. Now, what most people don't realize is there's
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:20.480]   far more opportunity to minimize tax than there is to minimize fees. I mean,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.520]   I think it's like 40x the amount of extra benefit you can get from doing a
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:31.120]   few smart things. So, tax loss harvesting is one of them. People who earn
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.760]   more income typically don't qualify for Roth IRAs, but you can convert from
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.640]   a traditional to a Roth IRA with what's known a backdoor Roth. We do that
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:48.480]   automatically for you at Wealthfront. That's a really nifty way to save taxes.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   So, there are a bunch of hacks around minimizing your taxes that can actually
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:03.840]   make a difference of 30% to 70% of what you ultimately can retire on, just by
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.040]   saving those taxes. And you mentioned tax loss harvesting. For people who
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.880]   aren't familiar, how does that work and is that something anyone can implement
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:18.640]   and start doing themselves? Sure. Well, they can try, but they can't do it as
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:24.000]   well as a computer can do it. So, it's a loophole in the tax code that has
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.520]   existed for decades that wealthy people have taken advantage of because their
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   financial advisors offered it for them that most people didn't know existed. So,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   basically, the way that it works is, imagine that you have a portfolio of
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.240]   three index funds, U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, and bonds. And let's say you
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:57.680]   invested $10,000 and you invested $3,333 in each of those three index funds.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.000]   Now, imagine that the foreign stocks goes up and the bonds goes up, but the
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   U.S. stocks goes down to $3,000. So, the way tax loss harvesting works is you
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.920]   could sell that index fund for U.S. stocks and you would take the loss of the
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:23.680]   $333 and then you would reinvest the $3,000 in another U.S. equities index
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.160]   fund, but something that was slightly different than the index you had before.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.520]   You can't do the identical index, otherwise you can't apply the losses that
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.400]   you recognize to lower your taxes. So, if you had an S&P 500 index fund, you'd
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:47.120]   get a Russell 3000 index fund. And that way, you have maintained the risk and
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.840]   return characteristics of your portfolio. You still have $3,000 invested in U.S.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:58.720]   equities, but you've recognized this loss of $333 that you can either apply
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:05.120]   to up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year or against short-term capital
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:11.360]   gains. And if you have more losses than you have gains and more than you have
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   $3,000 of ordinary income, you can roll it forward for future years. So, your
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.320]   portfolio stays the exact same in terms of risk and reward characteristics, but
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:28.880]   you have these tax losses that you can use to reduce your taxes. For most
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.160]   financial advisors, it's too complicated to do this more than once a year
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   because they might have 200 clients and they have many tax lots for each
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.960]   client. So, if you add on deposits, that's a new tax lot. Every time one of
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.320]   your index funds pays a dividend, you reinvest that, that's a tax lot. So,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.040]   it's really complicated to look at this more than once a year, but computers
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.280]   don't care how many times they look at it. So, Wealthfront does it on a daily
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.800]   basis, and that way, we're able to capture more of these losses than a
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.200]   human being could do themselves. And the amount of value that we've
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.160]   generated, we actually publish these numbers, we're the only people who
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.320]   publish the amount of losses that we've been able to harvest, which says a lot
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.600]   about how much better we are than everyone else, because others would
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.080]   publish if they could meet our performance. But depending on whether you
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   live in a state where you have to pay state income tax, and depending on how
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.960]   risky a portfolio you're in, the riskier the portfolio, the more volatile it is,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.440]   the more opportunity for tax losses. The amount of benefit, after-tax benefit
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.000]   that we generate each year, is worth anywhere between three to 13 times the
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.480]   fee that we charge. So, you're almost doing yourself a disservice, if you try
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.040]   to do this on your own, better to allocate it to us, because it's not that
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.240]   we're so good, it's just that computers are much better at doing this than human
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:58.800]   beings are.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.960]   So, unless you want to write your own software, which is probably not the
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   best…
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.320]   It's not just that, Chris. So, even if you wrote your own software, you would
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.000]   need real-time data feeds in order to do this, and then you'd have to get an API
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.600]   from your brokerage firm with real-time data feeds that you have to pay for in
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.080]   order to do all this. So, the cost of the data is quite significant if you can't
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.240]   amortize it across thousands or millions of clients.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:31.760]   Yeah, that makes sense. And so, to someone listening who maybe hasn't really
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.000]   thought deeply about their investment portfolio until now, holds a few stocks,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.680]   maybe holds a few mutual funds, a hodgepodge of things, how do you think
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.880]   people should make big changes to the way they've been investing?
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.800]   Well, as I said before, there's more money to be saved through minimizing
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   taxes than anything else. So, if you have a short-term gain, you might want to
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.880]   think about holding onto it for a year before you sell it so that you pay a
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.080]   much lower tax rate on that gain. If you've only owned it for, you know, a
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.560]   couple of months, then I would think about selling it now. And if there's
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.040]   something in which you have really high conviction because you have an
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:19.200]   information advantage, not because you like a company, then you might want to
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.560]   hold onto that security as well. But as you sell the securities when they go
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:31.920]   long-term, or you have less conviction, and as you save incremental money, I
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.640]   really think you would be better served investing in a diversified portfolio of
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.200]   low-cost index funds, whether on your own or through Wealthfront, where you
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.040]   get the benefit of tax-loss harvesting.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.880]   And what would you say to the person who's not investing today and, you know,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.960]   is constantly hearing through the media that the markets are overvalued and
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.560]   nervous to just invest all this money they've been saving and, you know,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.240]   probably saving hard for years?
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.320]   You know, one of the biggest disservices the media does for individual
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.240]   investors is tout the fact that the market's at an all-time high. Well, the
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.920]   market should be at an all-time high every year because, on average, the U.S.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:22.320]   equity markets compound at a rate of about 8% a year. Well, if that's true,
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.360]   then we should be hitting records every single year. So the fact that the
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.880]   market is at the highest level it's ever been is absolutely irrelevant. And one
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.280]   thing academic research has shown, that it's almost impossible to time the
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.240]   market for when it's cheap. I know about five people on Earth who are pretty
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.760]   good at this, and they all run hedge funds that charge enormous fees and that
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:54.480]   require $50-100 million minimums. So it's not something that the average human
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.640]   being can do. So my attitude is you shouldn't try to time the market. Just
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:05.200]   dollar-cost average. You know, invest monthly or quarterly so that maybe you
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.240]   get some benefit of the volatility of the market. But it should always be up,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.000]   and it should always be at a high.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.240]   Yeah, I know that dollar-cost averaging, there's a Vanguard study that showed
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.880]   that putting all of your money in at once is actually a better option than
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.400]   dollar-cost averaging. But that so much of investing is emotional, that if you
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.080]   have an emotional satisfaction of knowing you paced out your investing
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.040]   over a year or over six months, that might actually be worth it for you as a
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.520]   kind of net happiness combined with investment return than just investing
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.960]   all at once, even if that is the academically best thing.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.800]   But you know, one of the major reasons why the Vanguard research came to that
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:57.280]   conclusion is because, on average, markets are up every year. So if you're
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.840]   playing the averages, of course you shouldn't dollar-cost average. You
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:08.560]   should put everything in now. So that's somewhat of the fault of that study,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:14.640]   and I know I'm arguing against myself. But I think the big reason why the data
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.120]   shows you shouldn't dollar-cost average is because, on average, markets go up.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.440]   Therefore, you should invest as soon as you possibly can to get the benefit
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.680]   from that. But I think in terms of regret minimization, which is really
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.040]   important and a big part of the reason why behavioral economics is so
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.280]   compelling, is that people would be better off if they dollar-cost average.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.160]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   Are there any other behavioral economics lessons you've learned over the years
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.040]   that would be worth listening to and sharing about when it comes to investing
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.540]   and saving?
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:11.200]   Nothing about investing, good investing, feels right. So there's a lot of
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.800]   academic research that has shown that, on average, individual investors prefer
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:22.480]   to invest when the market is rising, and they prefer to sell when the market
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.120]   declines. Well, that's the exact opposite of what you should do. That's
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.120]   actually really, really bad.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:36.800]   So it's hard to pick when the market has declined enough, which is why I just
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.160]   say dollar-cost average. But whenever something feels like it's the right
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.920]   thing to do in investing, you better question it and ask someone who's
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.240]   really good at investing about it, because the likelihood is that that's
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.760]   not the right thing to do.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:57.440]   So one of the feelings I have right now is I'm watching countless people
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:04.560]   online that I know making boatloads of money, buying NFTs on the internet,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.200]   buying long-tail cryptocurrencies that no one's ever heard of. What do you
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.440]   say to the person who's sitting on the sidelines feeling like they're totally
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.200]   missing out while their friends are making five, ten, hundred times their
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:22.800]   money in matters of weeks? Obviously, it would feel good to start making that
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.360]   money, but what do you say to those people?
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.440]   That's not investing. That's speculating.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:34.960]   And is there a place for speculating in the market for people's portfolios, or
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.920]   is that not something?
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:42.160]   I don't believe there is. I personally don't believe there is. The most
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.640]   sophisticated investors I know don't speculate. So the difference between a
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.560]   speculation and an investment is that an investment has a cash flow, so you can
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.600]   evaluate its merits based on your expectation for those cash flows.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:07.120]   Something that doesn't have a cash flow is purely a gamble. Why should gold go
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:14.880]   up? It's a shiny metal. It's purely emotional. The same is true, I think, for
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   cryptocurrencies. So to me, they are speculations. Commodities are
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:28.320]   speculations. I don't think that speculations have a place in a responsible
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:35.040]   portfolio. That being said, people have a fear of missing out, so they're going
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   to do it. And all I can say is keep it to a small percentage of your portfolio.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.360]   The fact that they went up doesn't mean that the person who bought them was
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.240]   smart. It means they were lucky. And that's the part that people have a hard
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:59.040]   time understanding. This is why I really preach, don't judge a decision by its
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:05.760]   outcome, because luck can play a role in that outcome. Judge it by the quality
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.160]   of the process that you pursued in reaching that conclusion.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   Yeah, I try to look back. A friend of mine always reminds me, you know, there
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.680]   are decisions we made in our lives that if we made an alternative decision, we
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.200]   would have made more money. And he always says, look back at the information you
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.440]   had when you made the decision. And with only that information, did you feel like
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.280]   you made a good decision? And you should feel good that you made a good decision.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.560]   You might have missed out on making a lot of money, but you can at least know
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.320]   that you made a good decision. So luck plays a role in outcome, so you can't
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.920]   totally judge a decision by the outcome. That makes sense. You've mentioned a lot
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.760]   of times, you know, a lot of the people you know and the most sophisticated
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   investors you know do this. What do you think changes as people have more money
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.200]   in terms of the way they invest in and what threshold is it that those changes
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.640]   happen? I think as people become wealthier, they think they become smarter.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:10.080]   And it sounds like you don't believe that's true. I do not. So do you think
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.920]   there's a level at which people's investment strategies should change? I do
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   not. So the wealthier you get, so once your wealth goes above a certain level,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.960]   you qualify for a private wealth manager as a financial advisor versus just a
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.160]   regular financial advisor. A private wealth manager might have a five or ten
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.000]   million dollar minimum and might work for Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.120]   J.P. Morgan, whereas the financial advisor works for Morgan Stanley, Smith
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:47.120]   Barney, or a general brokerage firm. Now one of the things that, one of the
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.880]   biggest things that private wealth managers sell to entice you to let them
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:59.040]   manage your money is access to alternative assets. So alternative assets
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.960]   include venture capital and private equity and hedge funds. So people
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.680]   constantly hear stories about how well those kinds of investment managers do
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.240]   and therefore they want access to them. And the private wealth manager sells the
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.520]   ability to get access. What they don't tell you is the ones that they give you
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.280]   access to are horrible. And I can tell you this from experience that as the
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:32.720]   manager of, or co-manager of one of the premier alternative asset managers,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:38.160]   Benchmark Capital, we had our choice of investors. We did very, very well. And if
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.680]   you do very well, you have a choice of investor. As I said earlier, individual
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.480]   investors consistently like investing when the market goes up and they like
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.800]   selling when the market goes down. Well, that's the exact opposite of the person
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.880]   that we want as an investor in our fund. When the market declines, we don't want
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.560]   people running for the exits. We want people who are going to be there through
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   thick and thin. So we want investors who have the longest term perspective and
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.840]   they're generally the university endowments and charitable foundations.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.360]   The last people we want are individual investors. So if you have a great track
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.800]   record, you're going to take money from the best investors and not the worst
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.360]   investors. So who do you think is going to take money from individual investors?
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:33.840]   The shittiest investment managers. So it's like a Groucho Marx used to say,
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.240]   never join a club that would have you as a member. If a private wealth manager is
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:44.400]   giving you access to a fund, you should not want it. But I see people fall for
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.480]   this over and over and over again.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.360]   So is there a world where it makes sense for the average investor to work with
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.040]   one of these wealth managers or financial advisors and pay their fees?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:03.280]   If they are very scared of investing and they need a lot of handholding, yeah.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.320]   Yeah. If the alternative is not investing, it might be worth it.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:12.720]   Agreed. Agreed. I think if one were to hire an outstanding tax advisor or tax
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.480]   accountant, you get 90% of the value of what you get from a wealth manager at a
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:25.440]   tiny fraction of the fee. You get all the handholding and all the sophistication
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.640]   without having to pay 1%.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.520]   Yeah, I think the same thing goes with estate planning. I've talked to plenty
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.800]   of financial advisors that say, oh, we'll help you with your estate planning. And
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.960]   the funny thing is, most of them don't actually do it. They'll just help find
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.880]   the person, which you could very well do on your own. But the cost of estate
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.840]   planning is like a one-time few thousand dollars, update it maybe the next time
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.920]   you have a kid or something. But other than that, there's no reason to pay an
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.080]   ongoing fee for something like that.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.600]   And the estate planner who works for the private wealth manager can't be
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   anywhere near as good as the one who's independent because the one who's
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.680]   independent is going to make a lot more money. So it's an intelligence test
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.200]   working with the estate planner who works for the private wealth management
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.960]   firm. I never understand that either.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:16.480]   Yeah, wow. So, okay. So I feel like we touched on a lot of different investing
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.280]   topics. The one thing that I also want to do is deviate kind of wildly from
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.360]   investing and ask for your thoughts on a few things that you've been fortunate to
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.520]   share with me before, but that I thought are really valuable lessons I've learned
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:35.280]   from you. One is all about negotiating. I've had the pleasure of working for you
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.600]   when negotiating and then the alternative of working against you and negotiating.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.440]   I think you got the better of me, Chris.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:48.320]   But I think you have a strategy that is rare and I'd love you to share it a
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.120]   little bit about it.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.360]   Well, it's one that I learned from my partner, Bruce Stenlevy, who's had the
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.520]   biggest impact on me professionally. He's the best venture capitalist I ever
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:04.400]   met and the best influencer I've ever met. Not influencer in the Instagram
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.240]   context, but influencer in the context of ability to influence one's decision.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:18.480]   Bruce is a really big believer in giving trust to get trust. And the analogy
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.640]   that I like to use to describe his strategy is you put the gun in the other
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.880]   person's hand. If they fire, you don't work with them. So when Bruce would
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.720]   negotiate with entrepreneurs, like if I were negotiating a deal with you, Chris,
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   I would say, what do you think is the fair value? You just tell me and I'll do
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:46.640]   it. Now, Bruce knew what the approximate range of fair was. Most human beings
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:55.200]   don't want to be thought of as taking advantage. So many of them will actually
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.000]   ask for something that's slightly below average.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.840]   Or maybe they might ask for something that's slightly above average. A very
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.640]   small percentage of human beings will ask for something well in excess of
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.040]   average. And if they do, that's like firing the gun. So you just don't work
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.640]   with them because you know that they're going to try to take advantage every
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.280]   step of the way. And that way, Bruce slept well at night. He developed an
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.040]   unbelievable reputation among entrepreneurs as someone who was phenomenal
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.080]   to work with and everything seemed to work out well.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:37.840]   So I consider things like that, just total great hacks that help you operate
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.480]   your life in a more effective way and help you with success. Are there other
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.000]   either kind of like ways to operate in life or business that you've picked up
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.080]   that you think are kind of parting things to share?
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.840]   I think the biggest thing that I have to share is always try to be Pareto
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:52:01.200]   optimal. And by that, I mean, you try to figure out what's the 20% that drives
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:08.240]   80% of the value. The Pareto optimal is named for Vilfredo Pareto, a
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.440]   mathematicians in the, I think, 1880s in Italy who came up with perhaps the
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:19.920]   most compelling rule of nature ever to be discovered. And that is the 80/20
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:26.080]   rule that in almost everything, there's an 80/20. 80% of the wealth is held by
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.200]   20% of the people. 80% of the contributions in a community are made by
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.080]   20% of the people. There's 80/20 in absolutely everything. And I think it's
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:42.160]   an amazing proxy for judgment. People who apply the Pareto rule have much,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:47.120]   much better judgment. Figure out everything isn't equal. There are certain
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.200]   things you can do that are far more impactful than others. Figure out the
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.720]   most impactful things and only focus your efforts on those things and let all
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.800]   other stuff just happen because it's not going to make much of a difference.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.080]   Yep. I've tried my best. I think one of the things that many of the listeners
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.400]   here will share with me is a desire for optimization often feels hard to stop.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:19.040]   And the final advice I have for them is instead of optimizing the last 20% of
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.800]   one part of your life, try to optimize the first 80% of another.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.600]   That's phenomenal advice.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.480]   And so if you've maxed out your travel hacking and your credit cards, look at
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.760]   investing. If you've maxed out investing, look at savings or look at your
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.960]   relationship. And only come to the 20% when you've hit the 80% on everything.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.120]   And if you've hit the 80% on everything, then just congratulate yourself because
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.400]   that happens very rarely.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.480]   Now, there's one other thing that relates to the conversation we had about
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:57.680]   taxes. And that is, interestingly, I do not try to minimize taxes wherever I
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:04.640]   can. Let me repeat that. I don't always try to minimize my taxes because there
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:10.320]   is typically a trade-off between tax savings and liquidity. The more you're
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:16.400]   willing to lock up your money, the more tax savings one is typically able to
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:24.160]   generate. I find that liquidity is undervalued. That having money available
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:32.320]   when you need it is really, really important. It has been for me. And so I
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:38.080]   will give up tax savings in order to have more liquidity. And that's
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.640]   something that runs counter to the hacks that you propose to people. I just
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.680]   want people to consider whether or not it's going to lock up your money. And if
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:57.360]   it is, is that a good idea? A great example of what I think is terrible
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:05.280]   advice for people who know how to save is maxing out your 401(k). Most pundits
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:12.000]   will recommend that you max out your 401(k). I think that is horrible advice
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.320]   because you cannot use the money in your 401(k) for anything until you retire.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:24.000]   So if you want to fund your kid's education, you can't access it. If you
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.720]   want to buy a home, you can't access it. It's a really bad idea. Now, it's great
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.600]   to get those tax savings from the 401(k), but I don't think those tax savings
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:41.440]   are worth the loss of liquidity. So my recommendation to people is only use
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.240]   your 401(k) up to your employer match. If they're not going to match, put it
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:52.560]   into an IRA because at least you can borrow from an IRA and use that money.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:58.400]   So that's something that's really counterintuitive that most people don't
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.960]   consider. And I think that the reason that pundits give this advice is that the
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:08.880]   vast majority of Americans literally don't know how to save. So the only way
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.440]   you can get them to save is to force them to do so by garnishing their
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:19.200]   paycheck through a 401(k) contribution, which is why I started out this advice
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.800]   by saying if you know how to save, then maxing out your 401(k) is a really bad
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.120]   idea.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:31.840]   Is there a point at which if someone, let's say, knows how to save, has a
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.880]   decent amount of cash saved up for emergencies that you think it could make
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.360]   sense?
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:41.040]   It depends how much money you think you're likely to need in the future.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.240]   And are there things you think people commonly don't realize they might need
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:46.960]   liquidity for?
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.720]   Down payment on a home, especially if you live in a high cost of living area.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:58.560]   I mean, if you live in California or New York or major metropolitan areas, you
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:03.360]   need a lot of money to make a down payment. And you need a lot of money to
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.640]   pay for your kid's college.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.280]   What's your stance on a 529 then?
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:15.040]   It's a similar type of vehicle to a 401(k) from a tax advantage standpoint,
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.840]   but with kind of very restrictive rules on how you use it.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.880]   But you can use it well before you retire.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:27.920]   So I think it's a better product in that you have access to it sooner.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.280]   And there's more flexibility that I guess it can be used for private school
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:40.320]   if you want, but it's locked up for 18 years versus potentially 40 years.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.600]   There are still challenges associated with it, but I don't think it's as bad
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.480]   as a 401(k).
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.400]   You said earlier that contrarian opinions are often valuable and hard to
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:54.800]   find. So I think that this is one of the more contrarian things in personal
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.960]   finance that I know you've shared with me and has made me rethink whether I'm
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   valuing liquidity appropriately.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.320]   Boy, most people don't value it until they need it.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.720]   Yeah. And then you're forced to pay huge penalties.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.000]   Huge.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.600]   And so, yeah, I think it's something to think about.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   And I think the number one thing that I'm sure we both agree is that if you
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.920]   aren't leaving aside enough money for emergencies, that should be priority
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.160]   one.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.520]   Absolutely.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.720]   Absolutely.
