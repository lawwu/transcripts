[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to optimize
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   every aspect of my life.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.920]   When it comes to the big decisions about money, how you invest your savings has
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.840]   to be one of the biggest questions we all face, and honestly, one of the most
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.320]   important.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.360]   So I wanted to do an episode all about investing, and I couldn't think of anyone
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.120]   better to join me than Andy Ratcliffe.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.080]   Andy is the co-founder and CEO of Wealthfront, an investing app that makes
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth with over $27 billion in assets.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   He also serves as the chairman of the Endowment Investment Committee for the
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.480]   University of Pennsylvania and is a member of the faculty at the Stanford
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.720]   Graduate School of Business.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.280]   Prior to Wealthfront, Andy co-founded Benchmark Capital, arguably one of the
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   most successful venture capital firms of all time, with their first fund returning
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   92 times the original investment.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.440]   In fact, Andy is so impressive that after meeting him and learning about Wealthfront,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   I decided to shut down my last startup, Grove, and join Wealthfront with a handful
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   of the people from our team.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.480]   In this episode, we'll talk about how you should be investing to build your wealth.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   We'll take a look at the mistakes so many people make investing.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.240]   We'll talk about how investing should or maybe shouldn't change as you make more
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.000]   money, and Andy will give you his take on why he thinks many of you should stop
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   contributing to your 401(k).
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.800]   Finally, just to clear up any conflicts, I am an employee and shareholder of
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.160]   Wealthfront, and Andy is my indirect boss.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.760]   But Wealthfront didn't pay me to be here, and this podcast is completely mine, so
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.560]   all of the opinions I express are solely my own and do not reflect the opinion of
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.000]   Wealthfront.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   As always, this podcast is for informational purposes only, should not be relied upon
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   for investment decisions, and all investing involves risk.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.560]   So without further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with the one and only Andy
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.040]   Radcliffe.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.640]   Andy, thanks for being here.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.200]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   Yeah, so the common thread on your resume is investing, and so I'd love to start a
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.240]   conversation about your journey investing and go back as early as it was when you
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.640]   made your first investment.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.560]   Well, that's actually, I think, an interesting story.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.200]   I knew nothing about investing.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.360]   I had no interest in it.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.600]   No one in my family had ever worked in the investment industry or had any
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.440]   sophistication around it, but I went to Wharton as an undergraduate student, so
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   University of Pennsylvania's business school as an undergraduate student.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   I also spent my time in the engineering school, but the most interesting course
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   that I took at Wharton was the first business simulation course.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.880]   Basically, the professor had come up with a way to simulate the financial
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.520]   performance of companies that competed with one another.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.480]   So to take the course, you were split into teams of four, and each week you had to
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.960]   make 26, something like 26 decisions, as did all of the other teams in the class.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   So you had to make decisions like how much money were you going to raise?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.480]   How much manufacturing capacity did you want to build?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   How many units would you build?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.600]   What would you price them at?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   How much money would you spend promoting them?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.560]   So you had to go through all of these inputs, and they were all fed into a
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   model, and out would come a financial statement, a balance sheet, and a stock
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.760]   price.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.840]   I was absolutely captivated by this, and about two or thirds or three quarters of
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.320]   the way through the course, I started to wonder, I figured out what the algorithm
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   was for success, and I wondered, "Huh, I wonder if you applied what the model
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.000]   looked for in companies, would that lead to good investment performance?"
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   Remember, this is circa 1978, and what the course really promoted is that
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.920]   companies should focus on high growth.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.840]   They should focus on market share.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.440]   You price low to get share, and then once you have the share, you can raise
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.320]   price to earn higher margins.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.000]   So it really looked for companies that built high return on equity and high
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.600]   operating margins, but first and foremost, high growth.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.320]   And so I looked for companies that had high growth and high return on equity
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.040]   and high margins, and lo and behold, they were all tech companies.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   So I built a simulated portfolio of the companies that matched what the simulator
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.040]   in the course looked for, and they did really well over six months to a year.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   So I convinced my father to give me a couple thousand dollars to invest in a
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.480]   couple of companies that best fit the model, and they did exceptionally well.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   And I continued to follow this model for quite some time, and I ended up paying
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.280]   for my graduate school education this way.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.240]   Wow.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   So that's how I became an investor.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   I had never had any intent to do so, but from this course really inspired me.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.040]   I became a TA of the course, and I just fell in love with it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   And did you know at that point that this would probably make
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.560]   up the rest of your career?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.400]   No clue whatsoever.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.560]   As a matter of fact, quite the contrary, because my dad had
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.840]   a small manufacturing business.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.200]   He was an entrepreneur, and my intent in going to an undergraduate business
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.080]   school was to join him on graduation and work in his company, and I thought I was
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.120]   going to go work in the family business, the very small family business, but I was
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.880]   so captivated by this that a couple of weeks before I graduated, I decided
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.040]   that I wanted to go out on my own.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   So I worked in investment banking for a couple of years.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.560]   So as I said before, I had a background in finance and computer science.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   So I first sought a job in computer science in New York.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.240]   So I grew up about 25 minutes outside of Manhattan and had
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.760]   always wanted to live in New York.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.600]   And so I looked for a job when I graduated in software development, but
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.040]   they were all time-sharing bureaus that served financial services companies.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.920]   And they all treated their programmers, as they then called them, like crap.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   And I thought, "I don't want that job."
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.520]   So I got a late start on looking for a job on Wall Street.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.200]   So I got a job working in mergers and acquisitions for one of
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.400]   the top five investment banks.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.760]   And as luck would have it, they were very early on in
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.680]   representing technology companies.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.920]   And I was the only person in the department who actually
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.280]   knew what the companies did.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   So I got exposure that I never should have gotten.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.360]   Meanwhile, I continued to hone my skills investing, and I learned
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.960]   about venture capital in my first year out of college, and I thought,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.560]   "God, that's the coolest job ever."
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.840]   It combined computer science, which I loved, with entrepreneurship, which
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.040]   I appreciated from my dad, and investing.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.440]   And so I had become friendly with someone who also worked as an
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.400]   analyst on Wall Street who wanted to work in venture capital.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.920]   And he said, "We've got to go to Stanford.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.960]   That's how we're going to get into this industry."
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.360]   And that's how I ultimately applied to Stanford Graduate School of
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.400]   Business, got in, and it changed my career.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.520]   Wow.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.480]   And so did you know throughout Stanford that venture capital was
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.080]   the end goal after graduation?
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.400]   Absolutely.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.840]   I knew I wanted to get involved as soon as I possibly could.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.000]   And I had a lot of really lucky breaks along the way.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.560]   The fellow who ran the M&A department at my firm before business
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.600]   school was a Stanford grad, and his son was a year ahead of me in business school.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   So he took me under his wing when I got to Palo Alto.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:44.040]   And his best friend was the son of the CEO of Hewlett-Packard,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.760]   which was the Google of its day.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.120]   And he worked for the Premier Seed Fund before that was a real thing.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   And this fellow, Greg Young, for some reason took a liking to me.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.320]   We had great chemistry, and he introduced me around to a bunch of
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.920]   venture capital firms to see if I might be able to get a part-time job
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.200]   while I was going to business school.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.880]   And he ultimately introduced me to the first crossover firm that
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.120]   invested in late-stage private and early-stage public companies.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.200]   And after this successful career for multiple decades, building one of the
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.640]   most well-known and best-performing funds, you got to a point where almost
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.520]   anyone would retire and just stop.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   And you did what is maybe the complete opposite of retirement and decided
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.200]   to go start a company, which I have done and is a lot of work.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.080]   And I'm not sure I would pick up that.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.040]   Unclearly not that intelligent, Chris.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.480]   But you decided to start a company in the investment space.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.640]   What did you think people were doing wrong that drove you to start Wealthfront?
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.120]   Sure.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.920]   Well, contrary to what most people think, great companies are not started as the
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   result of an entrepreneur saying, "I want to start a company, so I'm going to go
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.000]   find the best opportunity I can and then do that."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.200]   And typically it's described as, the process is described as someone who looks
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.600]   for a market that has a problem and then you develop a solution for the problem.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.160]   And that's how you get started.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.120]   Those kinds of businesses lead to very mundane and small outcomes.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.880]   The really great successes in venture capital are the result of an
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.280]   entrepreneur recognizing an inflection point in technology that allows them to
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.760]   build a new kind of product, and then they try to find a market for that product.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.800]   So it's the exact opposite of what you think it is.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.960]   I had absolutely no desire to start a company.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.280]   So I didn't know what I wanted to do, but when you've been successful and you
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.680]   retire, it's amazing how many interesting things find you.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.240]   Now, I was focused on giving back because I have a life beyond
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.920]   anything that I ever imagined.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   So I wanted to give back.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.720]   So I became a trustee at my undergraduate alma mater, Penn.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.560]   I started teaching, which I still do, at my grad school alma mater, Stanford.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:20.680]   And my wife and I started an innovative cancer research funding initiative.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.480]   So I wanted to give back to society.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.880]   And one of my responsibilities as a trustee at Penn was to sit on their
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.520]   endowment investment board, and the premier university endowments are the
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.400]   best managed diversified pools of capital in the world, and they all
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.280]   invest very similarly, and it struck me when I went to a meeting, one of my
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.840]   first meetings, that a lot of what they did was manual and spreadsheet based,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.000]   and that there were some APIs that had been created in the brokerage world that
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.040]   would allow you to build an automated investment service, and this was
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.880]   interesting to me because when I was a venture capitalist, a lot of the people
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.240]   that I recruited that went on to financial success would come to me for
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.560]   investment advice, and I could never tell them to do what I do because they
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.480]   couldn't afford the minimums, and so if one were to basically do an 80/20 on the
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.200]   endowment investment model and automate it, you could make really sophisticated
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.840]   investing available to the masses. And so I felt like I needed to do it for
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   social good, not because I wanted to build a business out of it, and I
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.440]   thought, oh, if it works, I'll just hire a CEO and I'll be a board member. So I
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.360]   never intended to run the company.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   And yet here you are.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.600]   And yet here I am.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.200]   And so when you thought about that original kind of moment of, okay, let's
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.800]   build an 80/20 version of the endowments, what does that mean? What types of
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.360]   investments did you think people needed to have in their portfolio, and what did
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.080]   you want to build there?
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.600]   Well, like almost every successful company, we pivoted from where we
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.200]   started. So the original insight from endowment investing was that university
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.880]   endowments are really good at picking managers that are likely to outperform
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.480]   the market. Now, this might sound like heresy coming from a guy who co-founded
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.560]   a company that built much of its reputation on passive investing, but
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.080]   there is a small percentage of managers out there that consistently outperform
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.800]   the market, and the endowments are really good at finding them. And they do it in
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:34.320]   a very similar way, and that is basically they look for managers who have a pretty
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.360]   long track record of outperforming, but who have done so consistent with their
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.680]   stated strategy. And that's the hard part. So that's how we started, was we
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.160]   built a marketplace of investment managers, and the managers that we chose
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.600]   over a year and a half outperformed the market by 4% net of fees, which was the
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.640]   good news. The bad news was nobody cared because it was too inconvenient. We were
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.320]   really only choosing managers that were ideal representatives of your US equity
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.880]   allocation, and US equity should be about a third of your portfolio. So it was
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.600]   really inconvenient because you had to take care of investing in non-US equities
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.200]   and in bonds. So the refrain that we would often hear from people is, "I'd
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.160]   rather that you manage all of my money adequately and inexpensively than a
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.480]   portion of it superbly." And that's when we pivoted into a diversified portfolio
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.840]   of low-cost index funds.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.200]   And how did you decide what kind of asset classes people should be investing
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   in?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:50.400]   The mix of asset classes is an incredibly well-understood problem. The
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.960]   solution to which was invented, I think, in 1958 and won the Nobel Prize in
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.160]   1990, called the Modern Portfolio Theory or the Capital Asset Pricing Model. So
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.720]   there's no rocket science associated with this. This is real commodity
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.440]   technology. It's just applying a computer to do it instead of a person.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   And do you think that for most people, it's a better approach to be passive and
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.000]   hands-off than to try to pick stocks?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.160]   The academic research on this is unbelievably clear and consistent. So
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   this reminds me of climate change, that 98% of scientists or more believe in
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:43.520]   climate change. The problem is that when news channels put together a debate,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.200]   they only have one person representing each side, which makes it seem like it's
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:56.000]   a 50/50 argument. But in the scientific community, it's 98 to 2. Well, the same
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.320]   goes for active versus passive investment, that it is almost impossible
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:08.760]   net of fees to outperform the market over the long term. You know, only a
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:14.160]   third of professional investment managers outperform the market in any one
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:22.680]   year. After 10 years, it's less than 15%. So what makes you as an amateur think
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.560]   that you can do this if you're not spending all of your time trying to find
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.600]   companies that are likely to beat their expectations? The fact that you like the
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.200]   company or not is nothing to do with whether or not the stock price is going
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.080]   to go up. It's deciding whether or not you think the company's earnings are
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   going to be in excess of the expectations or not. And that's really
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.120]   hard to do in something that amateurs, including myself, shouldn't be doing.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.080]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.400]   start to emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.080]   have too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth. If this
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:14.480]   is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, 1. 37,000. That's the
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.280]   number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm excited

[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:25.400]   N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E. There is nothing I love more than learning that something I
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.960]   enjoy is actually so good for you. And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.200]   tea. It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.360]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea. Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.200]   extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins. Then everything is triple toxin screened
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.680]   for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants. And Peak's
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.080]   products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.960]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.320]   friendly. They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.840]   green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.880]   kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good, and
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.720]   probably one of my favorite things to drink. And if you need another reason,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.920]   search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of polyphenols
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.560]   for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that Pu-Erh
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.840]   is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world. But you
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.880]   don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free US
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.560]   shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee. And for a limited time, you can
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.320]   get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12 tea samples at my link at

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.720]   And so, does that mean there's, you know, not a place for buying stocks in someone's
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.040]   investment portfolio, and that most of the people that are doing that should be
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.440]   really passive investing with everything? Or how do you think about that mix?
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:20.160]   Well, what they should be doing, or what they... The problem here is, the data's really clear
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:28.480]   that unless they have a really unique and unfair insight, they should not be
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.280]   picking stocks. Now, academics believe that the only way that one can outperform
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.320]   the market is if you have an information advantage. And they further believe that
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:48.400]   the only information advantages are illegal. I don't believe that. I actually
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.640]   think that some people are better at interpreting signal than others through
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:22:00.840]   experience. So there are a small number of investors who are outliers, who are
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:07.760]   able to outperform the market, not every single year, but over the long term. I
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.640]   think there are very, very few amateur investors who are able to do this. The
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.560]   fact that you did well one year doesn't mean that that you were really good. You
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.280]   know, one of the biggest mistakes people make is confusing absolute returns with
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.760]   relative returns. So, for example, Robinhood made a statement that their
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:36.600]   average customer from April 1st, 2020 to March 31st of 2021 saw an increase in
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.800]   their portfolio value of about 30%. So those people thought they're brilliant
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.760]   because if you could make a 30% return, you must be brilliant. Only problem is
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:56.320]   the S&P 500 was up 55%. So you lost 25% relative to having bought the index. Now,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.200]   when the market's only up 5%, those people are going to be down 20%. They
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.480]   don't realize it, but that's what's going to happen to the vast majority of them.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.960]   You know, you wouldn't think about picking up a scalpel and operating on
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.640]   your friends. Why would you think that without training you can invest like the
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:22.400]   best professionals? You can't. It's an apprenticeship business. Now, there might
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:29.000]   be a few outliers out there who could do it. So, all that being said, to me,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.560]   investing is like a diet, that you're unlikely to just invest passively
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.320]   because it's really boring and you hear your friends talk about the stocks they
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.640]   bought and how well they did. So, my thought is encourage people to buy a few
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.400]   stocks with less than 10% of their net worth to learn that they really don't
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.120]   know what they're doing. So, even if they lose some money, it's okay, or if they
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.880]   underperform the market, it's okay. But if you tell people you should only invest
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   in passive, they're not gonna live up to that diet because it's too boring. And so,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.680]   I'm in a really fortunate position that I have access to some of the best
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.080]   venture capital firms in the world, some of the best hedge funds in the world,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   because they want access to my network and my experience. If I didn't have
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.040]   access to those people, all of my money would be in a passively managed,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.880]   - I know a lot of people that have heard venture capital startups growing and
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.120]   decide they think they want to start angel investing. Do you think that is a
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.360]   similar strategy to stocks that people are going to outperform?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:47.560]   - It's even worse. The data shows that it's even worse. So, what's really
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:53.760]   consistent is that the top 20 venture capital firms generate on the order of
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.840]   95% of the realized returns of the industry. Now, many people confuse these
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.120]   numbers by looking at the unrealized returns, which are irrelevant. All that
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.360]   matters is that the return ultimately gets realized. So, you can have really
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.800]   high unrealized returns if you invest in a company and then the next round they
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.600]   get valued at $300 million and then at a billion dollars. But unless the company
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.120]   ultimately gets acquired or goes public at a valuation in excess of a billion
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:31.480]   dollars, that's not worth anything. So, about 3% of the venture capital firms
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:39.200]   generate 95% of the industry's realized returns. That says that 97% of
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:48.440]   professional venture capitalists are horrible at what they do. 97% of people
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.920]   who do this for a living are horrible at what they do. So, again, what makes you
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:01.560]   think as an amateur that you are going to generate great returns? Look, might you
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.080]   luck into one or two of them? Yeah, but you're not going to do it consistently,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:13.720]   so you shouldn't try. But I wrote an article about this for TechCrunch a
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.440]   number of years back, where I say you shouldn't do it, but you're not going to
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.480]   listen to me, so keep it to under 10% of your liquid net worth. Yeah, so it sounds
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.320]   like the the common theme is small amounts to feed that excitement, but if
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.000]   you want to increase the likelihood that your money will grow in the best way
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.800]   possible, passive investing, even if it's boring. You know, it's really funny. Our
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.120]   chief investment officer is the guy who invented passive investing, the father of
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.600]   that passive investing, Burt Malkiel, an emeritus professor at Princeton, who
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.800]   started this whole thing off with his book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:58.320]   About a year into Wealthfront's starting, or a year into offering a diversified
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.000]   passive portfolio, we recruited him to be our chief investment officer. And soon
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.360]   thereafter, we held an event in Palo Alto for our local clients, where they got to
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:13.200]   meet Burt and ask him questions. And one wise guy raised his hand and said, "Burt,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.120]   do you own any stocks? Because here's the guy who really believes in index
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:25.040]   investing." And Burt had a cute little grin on his face, and he said, "Yes, and I also
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:32.680]   like going to the dog track. I find them both very entertaining." So even Burt
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.800]   does it, but he does it for entertainment and with a very small percentage of his
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   net worth. I haven't bought an individual stock in 15 or 20 years. And I was a
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.440]   really good public investor.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.480]   What made you stop?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.000]   I don't have the time to do it. If I don't do a bunch of surgeries, would I
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   operate on someone? No.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.800]   Yeah. You know, there are experts that pick stocks. There are experts that buy
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.600]   art. So the platforms that let you invest in those, my general rule has been
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.000]   similar to yours, which is, it's probably not the best place for returns if
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.400]   they're coming to me, because I have not as much money as most people and don't
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.320]   know what I'm doing. And it probably seems like the reason they're coming to
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.000]   me is for exactly those reasons, that I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.680]   I think Warren Buffett said something like, "If you're really good at
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:32.680]   investing, why would you share your ideas? Why wouldn't you get some other
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.800]   people's money so you could buy more of those ideas?"
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:41.840]   Yeah, that always set me off with some of the platforms that let you crowdfund
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.880]   large investments, which is, if these are such great investments, aren't there
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.280]   institutional capital that would fund them? And am I just the sucker? But there
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.560]   is one asset that I think a lot of people I talk to believe is different,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.000]   which is real estate. And I meet plenty of people who think, you know, the way
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.880]   to save for the future is not to invest in the stock market, but to buy real
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.080]   estate, whether it's for rentals or for flipping. Do you think real estate fits
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.960]   in someone's kind of, not investment portfolio, but savings plan for their
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.480]   future?
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.040]   You know, I've heard that over and over and over again. We get that feedback a
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.840]   lot from our clients at Wealthfront. I actually wrote a blog post that showed
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.160]   how the numbers work for buying rental properties. And what most people don't
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   realize is that if you buy a rental property for the first at least five
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.400]   years, or maybe even 10, you're going to have negative cash flow. So it's not
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.920]   really an income property, that if you have to borrow the money to buy the
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.200]   property, if you look at the all in costs, they're likely greater than the
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.680]   rents that you're going to earn. And it's going to take a while for the rents
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.800]   growing at inflation to catch up to your expenses. Now, maybe you were
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.560]   fortunate that you bought it in an up and coming neighborhood and you're able
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.200]   to significantly increase your rents. But then that means that you're an expert
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.640]   at identifying neighborhoods that are going to change. So to me, that is
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.080]   completely analogous to picking individual securities. And if you don't
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.640]   do that for a living, what makes you think that you're going to be better at
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.720]   it than the people who are doing that for a living? There are many people who
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   do nothing but look for properties that are likely to appreciate at a very rapid
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:45.960]   rate so that they can increase the rents. So I don't understand why people
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.440]   would go out and try to buy properties. To me, it's the same as buying stocks,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:57.200]   better to invest in a diversified pool, like a real estate investment trust or
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   something of that sort.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.120]   And one thing I often remind people that are asking me similar questions is that
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.840]   people often don't factor in the down payment. They say, well, the rent is
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.680]   going to pay for the mortgage. And even if it covers all the HOA fees and the
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.640]   property tax, that down payment would have otherwise also been earning a
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:22.000]   return in the market. And at a minimum would maybe have some dividends that
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.680]   would count as cash flow that they forget. And they say, well, they're just
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.400]   looking at the mortgage payment. They're just comparing that to the rental
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.760]   income and forgetting that maybe they had to put $50,000 or $100,000 down.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.120]   They don't have the insurance payments built in. They don't have the real
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   estate taxes. They don't have maintenance. There's all sorts of things
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.120]   that they leave out of the equation that we put into the blog post that
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   explained. And I even shared the spreadsheet where I did all the
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.440]   calculations so people could play with their own numbers. It is really, really
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.000]   difficult to generate positive cash flow from a supposed income property.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.040]   Yeah. So, you know, when I started this show called All The Hacks, the idea
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   was to find kind of the extra optimizations that can help you earn
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.800]   more and upgrade money and life. And, you know, the strategy of passive
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.320]   investing maybe doesn't feel like that. But there are some investment, what
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.520]   I'll call hacks, that I'm curious which of or if any of them you think are
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.720]   actually opportunities for people. So are things like tax loss harvesting or
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.120]   pre-tax retirement accounts or direct indexing, are any of those things that
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.960]   might kind of give you an edge in the long run that might be viewed as kind
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.480]   of an optimization or a hack that many people aren't taking advantage of?
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.080]   Well, I'm going to quote Bert Malkiel again, who loves to say, "You can't
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.240]   outperform the market, so you shouldn't try. Better to buy index funds and
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   focus on the three things over which you do have control." And they are
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.800]   diversification, which he calls the only free lunch in investing, minimizing
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:05.600]   fees and minimizing taxes. Now, what most people don't realize is there's
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.720]   far more opportunity to minimize tax than there is to minimize fees. I mean,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.760]   I think it's like 40x the amount of extra benefit you can get from doing a
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.680]   few smart things. So tax loss harvesting is one of them. People who earn more
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.120]   income typically don't qualify for Roth IRAs, but you can convert from a
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.960]   traditional to a Roth IRA with what's known a backdoor Roth. We do that
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.920]   automatically for you at Wealthfront. That's a really nifty way to save
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.600]   taxes. So there are a bunch of hacks around minimizing your taxes that can
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:55.280]   actually make a difference of 30 to 70% of what you ultimately can retire on
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.360]   just by saving those taxes.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.600]   And you mentioned tax loss harvesting. For people who aren't familiar, how
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.000]   does that work? And is that something anyone can implement and start doing
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.600]   themselves?
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.520]   Sure. Well, they can try, but they can't do it as well as a computer can do
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:18.480]   it. So it's a loophole in the tax code that has existed for decades that
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.360]   wealthy people have taken advantage of because their financial advisors
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:29.520]   offered it for them that most people didn't know existed. So basically, the
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.600]   way that it works is imagine that you have a portfolio of three index funds,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:42.960]   U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, and bonds. And let's say you invested $10,000 and
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:51.040]   you invested $3,333 in each of those three index funds. Now, imagine that
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.360]   the foreign stocks goes up and the bonds goes up, but the U.S. stocks goes
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.840]   down to $3,000. So the way tax loss harvesting works is you could sell that
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:09.200]   index fund for U.S. stocks, and you would take the loss of the $333. And
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:17.000]   then you would reinvest the $3,000 in another U.S. equities index fund, but
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.680]   something that was slightly different than the index you had before. You
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.040]   can't do the identical index. Otherwise, you can't apply the losses that you
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.960]   recognize to lower your taxes. So if you had an S&P 500 index fund, you'd get
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.440]   a Russell 3000 index fund. And that way, you have maintained the risk and
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.680]   return characteristics of your portfolio. You still have $3,000 invested
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:50.480]   in U.S. equities, but you've recognized this loss of $333 that you can either
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:56.880]   apply to up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year or against short-term
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:03.000]   capital gains. And if you have more losses than you have gains and more
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.600]   than you have $3,000 of ordinary income, you can roll it forward for future
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:13.720]   years. So your portfolio stays the exact same in terms of risk and reward
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.320]   characteristics, but you have these tax losses that you can use to reduce your
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:25.400]   taxes. For most financial advisors, it's too complicated to do this more
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.680]   than once a year because they might have 200 clients and they have many tax
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   lots for each client. So if you add on deposits, that's a new tax lot. Every
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.200]   time one of your index funds pays a dividend, you reinvest that. That's a
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.800]   tax lot. So it's really complicated to look at this more than once a year, but
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.920]   computers don't care how many times they look at it. So Wealthfront does it
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:57.040]   on a daily basis and that way we're able to capture more of these losses than a
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   human being could do themselves. And the amount of value that we've generated, we
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.720]   actually publish these numbers. We're the only people who publish the amount of
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.600]   losses that we've been able to harvest, which says a lot about how much better
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.880]   we are than everyone else because others would publish if they could meet our
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.440]   performance. But depending on whether you live in a state where you have to pay
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.840]   state income tax and depending on how risky a portfolio you're in, the riskier
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.760]   the portfolio, the more volatile it is, the more opportunity for tax losses. The
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   amount of benefit, after-tax benefit, that we generate each year is worth
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   anywhere between 3 to 13 times the fee that we charge. So you're almost doing
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.640]   yourself a disservice if you try to do this on your own. Better to allocate it
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.360]   to us because it's not that we're so good, it's just that computers are much
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.160]   better at doing this than human beings are.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   So unless you want to write your own software, which is probably not the best
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.920]   It's not just that, Chris. So even if you wrote your own software, you would need
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:04.480]   real-time data feeds in order to do this. And then you'd have to get an API from
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.160]   your brokerage firm with real-time data feeds that you have to pay for in order
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.360]   to do all this. So the cost of the data is quite significant if you can't
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.600]   amortize it across thousands or millions of clients.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:24.000]   Yeah, that makes sense. And so to someone listening who maybe hasn't really
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.280]   thought deeply about their investment portfolio until now, holds a few stocks,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.960]   maybe holds a few mutual funds, a hodgepodge of things, how do you think
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.160]   people should make big changes to the way they've been investing?
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.000]   Well, as I said before, there's more money to be saved through minimizing
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.080]   taxes than anything else. So if you have a short-term gain, you might want to
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.120]   think about holding onto it for a year before you sell it so that you pay a
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.320]   much lower tax rate on that gain. If you've only owned it for, you know, a
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.840]   couple of months, then I would think about selling it now. And if there's
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.160]   something in which you have really high conviction, because you have an
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:11.480]   information advantage, not because you like a company, then you might want to
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.760]   hold on to that security as well. But as you sell the securities when they go
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:24.120]   long-term, or you have less conviction, and as you save incremental money, I
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.920]   really think you would be better served investing in a diversified portfolio of
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.520]   low-cost index funds, whether on your own or through Wealthfront, where you
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.280]   get the benefit of tax-less harvesting.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.160]   And what would you say to the person who's not investing today and, you know,
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.280]   is constantly hearing through the media that the markets are overvalued and
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.880]   nervous to just invest all this money they've been saving and, you know,
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.640]   probably saving hard for years?
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.560]   You know, one of the biggest disservices the media does for individual
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.520]   investors is tout the fact that the market's at an all-time high. Well, the
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.200]   market should be at an all-time high every year because, on average, the U.S.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.640]   equity markets compound at a rate of about 8% a year. Well, if that's true,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   then we should be hitting records every single year. So, the fact that the
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:25.160]   market is at the highest level it's ever been is absolutely irrelevant. And one
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.600]   thing academic research has shown that it's almost impossible to time the
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.520]   market for when it's cheap. I know about five people on Earth who are pretty
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:40.040]   good at this, and they all run hedge funds that charge enormous fees and that
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:46.440]   require $50 to $100 million minimums. So, it's not something that the average
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.680]   human being can do. So, my attitude is you shouldn't try to time the market.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:56.960]   Just dollar-cost average. You know, invest monthly or quarterly so that
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.200]   maybe you get some benefit of the volatility of the market. But it should
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.520]   always be up, and it should always be at a high.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:10.600]   Yeah, I know that dollar-cost averaging, there's a Vanguard study that showed
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.200]   that putting all of your money in at once is actually a better option than
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.720]   dollar-cost averaging. But that so much of investing is emotional, that if you
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.360]   have an emotional satisfaction of knowing you paced out your investing
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.600]   over a year, over six months, that might actually be worth it for you as a kind
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.880]   of net happiness combined with investment return than just investing
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.840]   all at once, even if that is the academically best thing.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:43.040]   But, you know, one of the major reasons why the Vanguard research came to that
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.000]   conclusion is because on average markets are up every year. So, if you're playing
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.520]   the averages, of course you shouldn't dollar-cost average. You should put
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:01.440]   everything in now. So, that's somewhat of the fault of that study, and I know I'm
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.760]   arguing against myself. But I think the big reason why the data shows you
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.000]   shouldn't dollar-cost average is because on average markets go up. Therefore, you
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.840]   should invest as soon as you possibly can to get the benefit from that. But I
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:22.200]   think in terms of regret minimization, which is really important and a big part
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:27.560]   of the reason why behavioral economics is so compelling, is that people would be
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.600]   better off if they dollar-cost average.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.960]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.160]   great addition to your new year routine. And I am so excited to be partnering

[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:47.440]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.120]   up your cooking at home? If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.720]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit I was a
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   skeptic at first. But after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.800]   Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.160]   episode. Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.640]   food from scratch in the microwave. And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.320]   cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much. The
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.840]   cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store and reheat all in
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:27.400]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer and oven safe too.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.640]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.840]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice. It is so good. And if you haven't checked
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.360]   out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you have to check it

[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.000]   lessons you've learned over the years that would be worth listening to and
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.640]   sharing about when it comes to investing and saving?
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:28.200]   Nothing about investing, good investing feels right. So there's a lot of
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:34.040]   academic research that has shown that on average individual investors prefer to
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.520]   invest when the market is rising and they prefer to sell when the market
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.080]   declines. Well, that's the exact opposite of what you should do. That's
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:52.120]   actually really, really bad. So it's hard to pick when the market is declined
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.760]   enough, which is why I just say dollar cost average. But whenever something
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.920]   feels like it's the right thing to do in investing, you better question it
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.360]   and ask someone who's really good at investing about it, because the
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.880]   likelihood is that that's not the right thing to do.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.400]   So so one of the feelings I have right now is I'm watching countless people
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.680]   online that I know making boatloads of money, buying, you know, NFTs on the
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.000]   internet, buying long tail cryptocurrencies that no one's ever heard
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.840]   of. What do you say to the person who's sitting on the sidelines feeling like
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.040]   they're totally missing out while their friends are making 5, 10, 100 times
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:39.000]   their money in matters of weeks? Obviously, you know, it would feel good
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   to start making that money. But what do you say to those people?
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.480]   That's not investing, that's speculating.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:50.920]   And is there a place for speculating, you know, in the market for for
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.480]   people's portfolios? Or is that
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:59.240]   I don't believe there is. I personally don't believe there is the most
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.600]   sophisticated investors I know, don't speculate. So the difference between a
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.400]   speculation and an investment is that an investment has a cash flow. So you
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:16.840]   can evaluate its merits based on your expectation for those cash flows.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:24.080]   Something that doesn't have a cash flow is purely a gamble. Why should gold go
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:31.680]   up? It's a shiny metal. It's purely emotional. The same is true, I think,
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.760]   for cryptocurrencies. So to me, they are speculations. Commodities are
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:44.400]   speculations. I don't think that speculations have a place in a
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   responsible portfolio. That being said, people have a fear of missing out. So
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:56.640]   they're going to do it. And all I can say is keep it to a small percentage
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.560]   of your portfolio. The fact that they went up doesn't mean that the person
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.040]   who bought them was smart. It means they were lucky. And that's the part
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.840]   that people have a hard time understanding. This is like this is why I
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:18.640]   really preach, don't judge a decision by its outcome, because luck can play
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.160]   a role in that outcome. Judge it by the quality of the process that you
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.240]   pursued in reaching that conclusion.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:32.600]   Yeah, I try to look back, a friend of mine always reminds me, you know, if
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.360]   there are decisions we made in our lives, that if we made an alternative
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.560]   decision, we would have made more money. And he always says, look back at the
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.000]   information you had when you made the decision. And with only that
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.560]   information, did you feel like you made a good decision? And you should feel
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.800]   good that you made a good decision. You might have missed out on making a lot
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.720]   of money, but you can at least know that you made a good decision.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:59.560]   So luck plays a role in outcomes. So you can't totally judge a decision by
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.200]   the outcome.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:05.160]   That makes sense. You've mentioned a lot of times, you know, a lot of the
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.800]   people you know, and the most sophisticated investors you know, do
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.520]   this. What do you think changes as people have more money in terms of the
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.600]   way they invest? And what threshold is it that those changes happen?
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.240]   I think as people become wealthier, they think they become smarter.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.000]   And it sounds like you don't believe that's true.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.400]   I do not.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.240]   So do you think there's a level at which people's investment strategies
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.000]   should change?
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I do not. So the wealthier you get, so once your wealth goes above a certain
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.600]   level, you qualify for a private wealth manager as a financial advisor versus
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.480]   just a regular financial advisor.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.720]   A private wealth manager might have a five or $10 million minimum and might
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.200]   work for Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan, whereas the financial
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:50:00.080]   advisor works for Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney, or a general brokerage firm.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.120]   Now, one of the things that one of the biggest things that private wealth
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:12.400]   managers sell to entice you to let them manage your money is access to
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.920]   alternative assets.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:19.640]   So alternative assets include venture capital and private equity and hedge
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.400]   funds. So people constantly hear stories about how well those kinds of
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.800]   investment managers do, and therefore they want access to them.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.200]   And the private wealth manager sells the ability to get access.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.320]   What they don't tell you is the ones that they give you access to are
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:44.480]   horrible. And they can tell you this from experience, that as the manager of
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.240]   a co-manager of one of the premier alternative asset managers, Benchmark
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.520]   Capital, we had our choice of investors.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.920]   We did very, very well.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:58.120]   And if you do very well, you have a choice of investor.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.720]   As I said earlier, individual investors consistently like investing when the
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.200]   market goes up and they like selling when the market goes down.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.440]   Well, that's the exact opposite of the person that we want as an investor in
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.560]   our fund. When the market declines, we don't want people running for the exits.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.320]   We want people who are going to be there through thick and thin.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:24.000]   So we want investors who have the longest term perspective.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.400]   And they're generally the university endowments and charitable foundations.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.640]   The last people we want are individual investors.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.960]   So if you have a great track record, you're going to take money from the best
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.480]   investors and not the worst investors.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   So who do you think is going to take money from individual investors?
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.320]   The shittiest investment managers.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:52.520]   So it's like a Groucho Marx used to say, never join a club that would have you as
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:57.560]   a member. If a private wealth manager is giving you access to a fund, you should
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:05.520]   not want it. But I see people fall for this over and over and over again.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:10.560]   So is there a world where it makes sense for the average investor to work with one
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.120]   of these wealth managers or financial advisors and pay their fees?
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:20.280]   If they are very scared of investing and they need a lot of handholding, yeah.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.160]   Yeah. If the alternative is not investing, it might be worth it.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   Agreed. Agreed.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:30.920]   I think if one were to hire an outstanding tax advisor or tax accountant, you get
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:36.600]   90% of the value of what you get from a wealth manager at a tiny fraction of the
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:43.360]   fee. You get all the handholding and all the sophistication without having to pay
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.120]   1%.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.480]   Yeah, I think the same thing goes with estate planning.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.400]   I've talked to plenty of financial advisors that say, oh, we'll help you with
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.240]   your estate planning.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.520]   And the funny thing is one of them, most of them don't actually do it.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.080]   They'll just help find the person, which you could very well do on your own.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:04.120]   But the cost of estate planning is like a one time few thousand dollars, update it
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.600]   maybe the next time you have a kid or something.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.520]   But other than that, there's no reason to pay an ongoing fee for something like
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:10.720]   that.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.080]   And the estate planner who works for the private wealth manager can't be anywhere
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.920]   near as good as the one who's independent because the one who's independent is
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.160]   going to make a lot more money.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.080]   So it's an intelligence test working with the estate planner who works for the
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.560]   private wealth management firm.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.080]   I never understand that either.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.760]   Yeah, wow.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.000]   So, OK, so I feel like we touched on a lot of different investing topics.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.440]   The one thing that I also want to do is deviate kind of wildly from investing and
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.080]   ask for your thoughts on a few things that you've been fortunate to share with me
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.160]   before, but that I thought are really valuable lessons I've learned from you.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.200]   One is all about negotiating.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.200]   I've had the the pleasure of working for you when negotiating and then the
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.520]   alternative of working against you and negotiating.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   I think you got the better of me, Chris.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:05.320]   But I think I think you have a strategy that is rare and I'd love you to share it
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.040]   a little bit about it.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.400]   Well, it's one that I learned from my partner, Bruce Stanley, who's had the
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.800]   biggest impact on me professionally.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:19.200]   He's the best venture capitalist I ever met and the best influencer I've ever
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.280]   met, not influencer in the Instagram context, but influencer in the context of
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.320]   ability to influence one's decision.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:33.040]   Bruce is a really big believer in giving trust to get trust.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:38.880]   And the analogy that I like to use to describe his strategy is you put the
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.600]   gun in the other person's hand.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.040]   If they fire, you don't work with them.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.600]   So when Bruce would negotiate with entrepreneurs, like if I were negotiating
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.200]   a deal with you, Chris, I would say, what do you think is the fair value?
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.880]   You just tell me and I'll do it.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:01.600]   Now, Bruce knew what the approximate range of fair was.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.880]   Most human beings don't want to be thought of as taking advantage.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:15.080]   So many of them will actually ask for something that's slightly below average.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:21.520]   Or maybe they might ask for something that's slightly above average.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.120]   A very small percentage of human beings will ask for something
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.120]   well in excess of average.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   And if they do, that's like firing the gun.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.160]   So you just don't work with them because you know that they're going to try to
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.480]   take advantage every step of the way.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.200]   And that way Bruce slept well at night.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.440]   He developed an unbelievable reputation among entrepreneurs as someone who was
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.040]   phenomenal to work with and everything seemed to work out well.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:54.840]   So I consider things like that, just total great hacks that help you operate
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.280]   your life in a more effective way and, and help you with success.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.200]   Are there other, either kind of like ways to operate in life or business
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   that you've picked up that you think are kind of parting things to share?
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:11.360]   I think the biggest thing that I have to share is always try to be Pareto optimal.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:19.640]   And by that, I mean you try to figure out what's the 20% that drives 80% of the value.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:27.120]   The Pareto optimal is named for Vilfredo Pareto, a mathematician in the, I think
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:34.520]   1880s in Italy, who came up with perhaps the most compelling rule of nature ever
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.560]   to be discovered, and that is the 80/20 rule that in almost everything, there's
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   an 80/20, 80% of the wealth is held by 20% of the people, 80% of the contributions
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.320]   in a community are made by 20% of the people.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.840]   There's 80/20 in absolutely everything.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.160]   And I think it's an amazing proxy for judgment.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:00.240]   People who apply the Pareto rule have much, much better judgment.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.120]   Figure out everything is an equal.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.080]   There are certain things you can do that are far more impactful than others.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.400]   Figure out the most impactful things and only focus your efforts on those things
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.320]   and let all other stuff just happen.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.880]   Cause it's not going to make much of a difference.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.600]   Yep.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.800]   I've tried my best.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.560]   I think one of the things that many of the listeners here will, will share
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:29.480]   with me is, you know, a desire for optimization often feels hard to stop.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:35.840]   And the final advice I have for them is instead of optimizing the last 20%
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   of one part of your life, try to optimize the first 80% of another.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.760]   That's phenomenal advice.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.160]   And so if you've maxed out your, your travel hacking and your
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.960]   credit cards, look at investing.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.720]   If you've maxed out investing, look at savings or look at your
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.760]   relationship and only come to the 20% when you've hit the 80% on everything.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.680]   And if you've hit the 80% on everything, then just congratulate yourself.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.400]   Cause that, that happens very rarely.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:06.080]   Now there's one other thing that relates to the conversation we had about taxes.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:14.920]   And that is, uh, interestingly, I do not try to minimize taxes wherever I can.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.480]   Let me repeat that.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.760]   I don't always try to minimize my taxes because there is typically a trade
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.800]   off between tax savings and liquidity.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.800]   The more you're willing to lock up your money, the more tax savings
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.880]   one is typically able to generate.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:41.600]   I find that liquidity is undervalued that having money available when you
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:50.480]   need it is really, really important has been for me, and so I will give up tax
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.720]   savings in order to have more liquidity.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:00.840]   And that's something that runs counter to the hacks that you propose to people.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:06.280]   I just want people to consider whether or not it's going to lock up your money.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.040]   And if it is, is that a good idea?
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:16.000]   A great example of what I think is terrible advice for people who know
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.880]   how to save is maxing out your 401k.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.640]   Most pundits will recommend that you max out your 401k.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:32.000]   I think that is horrible advice because you cannot use the money in
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.400]   your 401k for anything until you retire.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:40.640]   So if you want to fund your kid's education, you can't access it.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.960]   If you want to buy a home, you can't access it.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.880]   It's a really bad idea.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:51.520]   Now, it's great to get those tax savings from the 401k, but I don't think those
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.360]   tax savings are worth the loss of liquidity.
[00:59:54.360 --> 01:00:01.120]   So my recommendation to people is only use your 401k up to your employer match.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.320]   If they're not going to match, put it into an IRA because at least you can
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.600]   borrow from an IRA and use that money.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.440]   So that's something that's really counterintuitive that
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.880]   most people don't consider.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.960]   And I think that the reason that pundits give this advice is that the
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.320]   vast majority of Americans literally don't know how to save.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.560]   So the only way you can get them to save is to force them to do so by
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   garnishing their paycheck through a 401k contribution, which is why I started out
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.320]   this advice by saying, if you know how to save, then maxing out your
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.040]   401k is a really bad idea.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.840]   Is there a point at which if someone, let's say, knows how to save, has a
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.280]   decent amount of cash saved up for emergencies that you think it could make sense?
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.120]   It depends how much money you think you're likely to need in the future.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.880]   And are there things you think people commonly don't realize they
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.200]   might need liquidity for?
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.800]   Down payments on a home, especially if you live in a high cost of living area.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.560]   I mean, if you live in California or New York or major metropolitan areas, you
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.280]   need a lot of money to make a down payment and you need a lot of money
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.760]   to pay for your kid's college.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.280]   What's your stance on a 529 then?
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:32.640]   It's a similar type of vehicle to a 401k from a tax advantage standpoint, but with
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.840]   kind of very restrictive rules on how you use it.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.960]   But you can use it well before you retire.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.360]   So I think it's a better product in that you have access to it sooner and there's
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.560]   more flexibility that I guess it can be used for private school if you want, but
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:57.000]   it's locked up for 18 years versus potentially 40 years.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.680]   There are still challenges associated with it, but I don't
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.480]   think it's as bad as a 401k.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.760]   You said earlier that contrarian opinions are often valuable and hard to find.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.160]   So I think that this is one of the more contrarian things in personal finance
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.960]   that I know you've shared with me and has made me rethink whether I'm
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   valuing liquidity appropriately.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.440]   Boy, most people don't value it until they need it.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.800]   And then, then you're forced to pay huge penalties.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.160]   Huge.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.560]   And so, yeah, I think it's something to think about.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.400]   And, and I think the, the number one thing that I'm sure we both agree is that if
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.440]   you aren't leaving aside enough money for emergencies, that, that should be
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.160]   priority one.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.560]   Absolutely.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.840]   Absolutely.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.320]   Well, thank you so much for being here.

[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.480]   That was fantastic.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.000]   I really have learned so much from Andy in the past few years, and I hope you
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.560]   learned a few things from him today as well.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.440]   Next week, I'm going to be doing a solo episode from all the great questions and
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.480]   hacks you all have shared.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.320]   I'm really looking forward to that one.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.920]   If you have anything you want to share, whether it's a question, a hack, or you
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.360]   just want to say hi, I love hearing from listeners.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.120]   So please email me, chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.360]   That's it for today.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.240]   See you next time.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:29.320]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.080]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.280]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.160]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.240]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.520]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.840]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.520]   entertaining.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:58.080]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.200]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:07.160]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.800]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.440]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.400]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.280]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.640]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.800]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.160]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.640]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
