[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Well, if you're one of Australia's six million internet subscribers, you could soon have
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.400]   some new ammunition against online pornography. The federal government is reportedly preparing
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.360]   to launch tough, new controls. Users would be given free filtering software.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.720]   But how does it work? Well, Jeremy Howard is an internet and computer expert from Fastmail.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.980]   Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.600]   Can you explain to us the basis for how you use this software? How does it work?
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   Sure. There's actually been two proposals that have appeared in the last week. The first
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   one came from the ALP in Beasley's Budget Apply. And his proposal was that internet
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.080]   service providers, the people that you dial up to or who provide your broadband connection,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.320]   would be forced to install filters, which then you could optionally choose to use. And
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.480]   then the response from the government has been slightly different. It's been to provide
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520]   optional free software for you to install on your own computer at home. Both of these
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.200]   two systems work essentially the same way, which is that the company that runs the system
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.760]   has a list of websites, which they consider inappropriate for young people, and a list
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.320]   of words, which if they appear on a website, they consider could be inappropriate. And
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.000]   in each of those cases, the website would be blocked from viewing.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.360]   Okay. The problem we parents have these days, of course, is that our kids, once they go
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.140]   into school, they start working on computers from day one virtually. So they're all very
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.000]   computer savvy. So kids know how to get around a lot of things that we, you know, slightly
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.500]   less technologically minded parents don't have. How easy is it going to be for kids
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.120]   to beat these types of software?
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.960]   Look, Lesa, I think there's two target markets here. The first is for the very young children
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.720]   it is possible to accidentally stumble across content, which you may not want them to see.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.080]   A great example was a couple of years ago after Casey Donovan won Australian Idol, and
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.120]   Telstra Big Pond put up these big advertisements in the paper saying come and visit caseydonovan.com.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.480]   They forgot the .au and directed all of these people to a gay pornography site by mistake.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.820]   So if these people were running internet filters, then they would be, their kids wouldn't be
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.440]   accidentally coming across this content. Now, on the other hand, of course, there's the
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.120]   older children who aren't just stumbling across this stuff, but would love to find it. Now,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.960]   I had a little look, and I found that there's a paper widely disseminated on the internet
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.140]   which talks about how to get over internet filtering, and they describe 47 different
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.840]   ways to do it. I took a look at just one of those 47 ways, which listed 277 places that
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   you can get that particular method. So there are many ways to get around it, and yes, they
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.480]   do work.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.080]   Apart from the question of whether it's effective or not, and I guess this is a question as
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.640]   much for you as well as Jeremy, Les, I mean, do we need this kind of measure? Is it really
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.400]   the government's responsibility to be playing this role, or should it be a question of more
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   stringent and active parenting?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.480]   Well, Andrew, I'm not an expert in this area, but I'll tell you who is, and that's a group
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.800]   called NetAlert, which was set up by the government a few years ago, when they would be actually
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.000]   responsible for administering this new scheme as well. On their website, they actually list
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.640]   a number of things they suggest parents do. Towards the top of that list is make sure
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.040]   that the computer is in a public part of it, such as the family room, not at the back.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   Right, absolutely.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.480]   And that you should be discussing these things with your children. And one interesting point
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.920]   they make, which I thought was really important, is that, okay, your children don't only use
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   a computer at home, but friends house, library, school. The only way they can make informed
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.880]   decisions about what they view is if you give them the trust and the discussion when they're
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   at home.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yeah, indeed.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   It's a very interesting point.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.200]   Yeah, and very good advice. Jeremy Howard, thanks so much for your time this morning.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.440]   You're welcome.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.320]   We've actually got NetNanny on all our computers at home, which we put in very early on.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320]   Does it work?
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.360]   Look, it does, but sometimes it's overzealous. For example, when my information was coming
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.440]   through late last night for doing this story, the word "porn" appeared, so I couldn't
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.040]   downline the brain for it. But my eldest son, who's in high school, and of course they all
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   have laptops, he's just gone into high school, he actually can't download his maths homework.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   Really?
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   Because there's something in the maths homework.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   Great excuse.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400]   It's a brilliant, better-than-dog-ate-my homework.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.320]   Yeah, that's right. The NetNanny ate my homework.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   I reckon even an email that said, "I'm now seeing this to your laptop" would probably
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   get filtered out.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.760]   Yeah, very impossibly, very impossibly. But that is great advice, making sure that you've
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.880]   got the computer in a public area, somewhere in the family room. Because, as we know, kids
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   can disappear into their rooms for hours on end when they've got that sort of access.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.820]   Yeah, that's right. And it's not just porn, but it breaks up the sort of family dynamic
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   Absolutely.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   This room all night, doesn't it?
