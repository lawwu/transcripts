[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   verses 4 & 5 in the 12th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, "And I say
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.920]   have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear. Fear him
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:30.520]   which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him."
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.160]   Now we are meeting together like this Sunday by Sunday in order to consider
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.680]   this great message that is here before us in the Bible, and we do so of course
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.880]   as living in this world as it is at this present time. We are not met together to
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.000]   forget the world in which we are living. We are met together here to know how to
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.920]   live in it, and how to live triumphantly in it, and how to be more than conquerors
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.960]   in spite of everything that is true of it and in it at this present time. And
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.040]   we've been looking at this whole situation. Here's the whole problem of
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.800]   life, isn't it? How can we live in a world like this, and especially at a time such
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.000]   as this? Why is the world as it is? These are the questions, and I'm laying it down
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.080]   as a proposition that the supreme tragedy in the world at this hour is not
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.920]   so much that men are making these horrible bombs that may blow up the
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.600]   whole world at any moment. That's not the greatest tragedy. The tragedy is that the
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.240]   world won't listen to this message. Dismisses it in various ways, and we've
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.560]   been trying to consider why this is, so that we may disabuse the minds of
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.520]   any were in that position. Here's the only hope. There's no other. That's very
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.920]   obvious, isn't it? But there is hope here. Why won't people believe it? Why do they
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.720]   reject it? Well, we're looking at some of the answers. We've seen that some won't
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   even look at it because it's too old, played out, finished, belongs to the past.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.220]   Bible and anachronism in the modern world, therefore not even to be looked at.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.640]   Others say that they're not interested because surely Christianity has been
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.480]   tried and found wanting. It's been given a very good chance in this world. They
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.040]   say if anything has ever been given a chance, it's that Christianity of yours.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.160]   It's been preached now for nearly 2,000 years, yet look at the mess it's put us
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.040]   into. We've considered then. Then last Sunday night we were looking at this. We
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.780]   see that there are many who won't consider this because they know at once
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.160]   that it's got a fundamentally different outlook with regard to the cause of our
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.200]   troubles. It was Armistice Night, Remembrance Sunday, whatever we call it,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.840]   and here we were considering the fact of two world wars and death. And the
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.280]   question was, whence come wars among you? And we saw this fundamental cleavage as
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.160]   the outlook of the world, the non-biblical outlook, and here's the message of the
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.200]   Bible. And the Bible says they come from your lusts, that war within you. Not this
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   man or that man, not something outside, something inside yourself. You have wars
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.760]   and fightings because you're creatures of lusts, controlled and governed by
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.080]   desires. But now in considering that, we saw that we were immediately face to
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.920]   face with the question of what is man himself? In considering the cause of war,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.600]   we inevitably came up against this great question of man himself and his own
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.680]   nature. You see the Biblical view is that the cause of wars and fighting says that
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.240]   man's a creature of lusts, that he's not governed by reason, but that he's
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.320]   governed by instincts and impulses and desires, cravings, inordinate affections.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well, now that's obviously something which is very radical, and it's that
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.320]   subject that we have to continue with this evening, because here, in a way, is
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.800]   the key to the whole situation. What is man? What is the truth about man himself?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, there is no doubt, I say, whatsoever, but that all our difficulties eventuate
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.080]   ultimately from our failure to be right about this particular question. It's
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.680]   central. It's no use considering the particular problems until we are clear
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.480]   about man himself, his nature, his being, his purpose, his destiny, and all that is
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   true of him. And therefore, I say, this being such a central and a vital question,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.060]   and the key to most other questions, we obviously must consider it very
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.320]   carefully. That's what I want to do this evening, and I want to do it in terms of
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.800]   this particular text, these two verses, that I've just read out to you, because
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.400]   here, in these verses, our Lord himself deals with that very question. And as you
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.640]   observe, he deals with it in a way that makes it very up-to-date and very
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.280]   modern. He's anticipating here, in a sense, the very condition of men at this
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.640]   present hour. Now, let me remind you of the circumstances. He was sending out his
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.000]   disciples to preach and to cast out devils, but he felt it was necessary to
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.440]   warn them as they went that they must expect to meet certain difficulties. He
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.960]   doesn't send them out in a carefree manner, just say, "Go out and preach, you'll
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.520]   have a marvelous time, everything's going to be wonderful." No, no, he warns them,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.800]   warns them very seriously. He says, "You'll meet opposition. Don't think for a
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.440]   moment that everybody's going to like what you're saying, they won't. They'll
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.640]   hate you." Indeed, he says, "You've got to be prepared for this, not mere opposition,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.080]   not mere persecution. You've got to face the possibility and the eventuality of
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.320]   your being put to death, because you are my servants, my followers, and because you
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.120]   are preaching my message." Why does he tell them this? Why does he warn them in
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.400]   this way? Well, it's made quite plain. He knew that the danger was this, that they
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.280]   would be so afraid of death that they might be tempted to compromise the
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:42.080]   message. Indeed, they might be tempted to go even further and to deny him. That's
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.600]   why he tells them, you see, that they're not to fear, because if the God who cares
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.320]   for the sparrows cares for them, the very hairs of their head are all numbered.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.080]   "Fear not, therefore," he says, "ye are of more value than many sparrows." And then
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.320]   goes on to say this, "Also I say unto you, whosoever shall confess me before men,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.880]   him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God. But he that
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.000]   denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God." Now that's it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.380]   That's the temptation. In other words, he saw this quite clearly, that the fear of
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.520]   death can be such a powerful thing that it can make a man deny the Lord himself.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.800]   That in order to save their lives, to save their skin, as it were, they would
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   not only compromise with the truth, but would even deny him. Well, now, he prophesied
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.720]   that. We've got an instance of it, of course, in the case of the Apostle Peter.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   You remember when our Lord was arrested and put on trial? Peter, with his natural
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.760]   impulsiveness and curiosity, wanted to hear the trial. So he goes into the court
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.640]   to listen, and he's challenged by a servant maid. She said, "You belong to him."
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.200]   And he denied it. He did it three times, you remember. And he even did it the last
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.560]   time with oaths and cursing. He denied that he knew the Lord Jesus Christ, his
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.760]   greatest friend, his greatest benefactor. What made him do it? Fear of death. Fear of
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.740]   death. Now this, our Lord is teaching here, can be such an overpowering thing, that it
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.640]   may make us do something that will affect our eternal destiny. If we deny
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.040]   him, he will deny us before the angels in heaven, and therefore we are lost. In
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   other words, the theme that he takes up here, is there just this theme of the
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:44.280]   fear of death. The great question of 1961, isn't it? The fear of death. The bombs.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.480]   There they are. They've got them on both sides. What if they let them off? That's
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.240]   been the great subject this year, hasn't it? The fear of death. But you see, our
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.320]   Lord shows us how to deal with it. And he teaches very plainly that there is only
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.960]   one true way of dealing with it. And what I want to do with you this evening is to
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.400]   show you how our Lord deals with this most modern up-to-date question of the
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   fear of death. This thing that is obsessing this generation, this time in
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.000]   which you and I are living, here is the only way truly to face it. Now let's
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.120]   observe his teaching. The matter divides itself up, as I see, very naturally and
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   inevitably into two main sections. First of all, let's observe how he deals with
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.880]   it in general. His whole approach to it. And then we'll be able to come to the
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:49.440]   particular. Now look at it in general. Notice what our Lord doesn't do here.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.060]   What do we not find here? Well, we don't find anything that can be
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.520]   described under the heading of escapism. There's nothing like that here.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.360]   That's what some people are turning to, escapism. Oh, it's too horrible to think
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.400]   of this. So they refuse to think. They just want to be happy for the moment. So
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.000]   you mustn't talk about these things. You mustn't mention death. All that matters
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.600]   is that I should be happy, that I should be having a good time, and that I should
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.360]   be enjoying myself. It isn't that. You know, the Christian Church is not a place
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.760]   into which you come just to forget your troubles. Many people have used it like
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.240]   that, and sometimes they've been encouraged to do that. No, no, the business
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.160]   of the Christian Church is not to provide entertainment for people in order
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.600]   that for a while they may forget their troubles. That's what they do in the
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.800]   public houses. That's what they're for. That's nothing but sheer escapism. Any
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.520]   man who takes to drink to try and forget his troubles and to make himself feel
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.560]   happy is just an escapist, nothing else at all. Oh, I know they talk about it as
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.760]   if it was wonderful, the most marvelous thing to do. That's why we are hearing so
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.560]   much about it. But the answer is it's pure escapism. But that's not the
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.080]   business of the Christian Church. The Church is not here to entertain, just to
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.160]   help people to forget for a while, and make them feel happy while they're here,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.880]   and then go back and face it all. That's not Christianity. This is not some kind
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.160]   of drunk. This is not some kind of supperific. This is not just helping
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.360]   people to forget their troubles, pull down the blinds, and persuade yourself
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.400]   that everything is wonderful and happy. That's not it. That's a travesty of it.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.340]   It's a libel upon it. Neither do I find here that he just administers some
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.720]   general comfort to them. Of course, everybody wants to be comforted. It's a nice
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.400]   thing to be comforted when you're in trouble, but it can be a very dangerous
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.320]   thing. When you've got an illness, you shouldn't go to your doctor wanting
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.840]   comfort. You should go to him to get an accurate diagnosis, to know what's the
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.480]   matter with you, in order that you can be put right. He's a poor doctor who just
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.320]   pats you on the back, says it's all right, who hasn't even examined you, and doesn't
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.800]   really know what's the matter with you. Not general comfort. That again is not
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   the business of the church. She's not here just to, oh, make people feel nice
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.760]   and happy while they're here. Church service, singing hymns, and, well, after all,
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.200]   isn't life wonderful? And somehow or other, it's all going to be all right.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.320]   That's not Christianity. That again is a travesty of it. It's a denial of it. It's
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.640]   not the truth. And there's nothing like that in our Lord's teaching. There's
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.880]   nothing like that in the teaching of the Bible anywhere. No, and thirdly, we don't
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.400]   find this. We don't find that what our Lord proposes to do is to change the
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.080]   conditions. He sends them out saying, now look here, there will be enemies, and they
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.000]   may not only persecute you, but they may even try to put you to death. Now, he
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.880]   doesn't say, now the thing to do is to change these men, somehow or other, so
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.920]   that they won't do that to you. He doesn't start a campaign, as it were, to
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.640]   stop these men from doing this, from threatening them, and from killing them.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.800]   That isn't what he does at all. And as I've been pointing out almost every
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.400]   Sunday night since we began this particular consideration, the Bible never
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.360]   does that. The Bible doesn't promise us that it's going to change the world. It
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.280]   doesn't tell us that it's going to help us by getting us to change the
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.000]   circumstances. It doesn't promise us that the circumstances are going to be
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.080]   changed ever. Indeed, it says the exact opposite. This is the teaching of this
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:39.800]   Bible. In the world you shall have tribulations. Now, that's the Christian
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.680]   message. It isn't the Bible, you see, that offers to put things right, or to do
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.320]   something to them that will take the problem away from us, and we won't have
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.200]   to face it. That's not Christianity. Now, I'm saying that's not Christianity. That
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.960]   doesn't mean to say that a Christian man shouldn't become a politician and do the
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.160]   best he can to restrain evil, let him do all he can along that line. But I say
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.440]   this message is not to do that. It's not primarily to change the circumstances
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.920]   and conditions, because we have no vestige of a promise that they ever are
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.440]   going to be changed in such a way that you and I will not have to face this
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.200]   great question. Never, I say, do we find that. Well now then, if that is what he
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.080]   doesn't do, what does he do? Well, here it is. Look at it. The first thing he does is
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.360]   to show us the terrible danger of allowing ourselves to be governed and
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   controlled by facts and events. That's what he's anticipating, and that's why
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.680]   he's, that's what he's trying to safeguard these men from. The danger is,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.560]   you see, that you go out into the world and you preach or whatever we have to do,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.840]   and suddenly we are confronted by circumstances that are inimical, and the
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.860]   danger is that we allow them to govern us and control us. And they so govern us
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.580]   and control us and dominate us that we can't think clearly. That's what he's
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:04.660]   concerned about. Now, this is the essence of the Christian message. A Christian is
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:10.340]   a man who no longer is dominated by life and its attendant circumstances, but who
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.920]   masters it and who controls it. Here is this thing here on the very surface. He
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.120]   says your danger is just going to be that, that you'll be so terrified of this
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.040]   possibility of death. You'll see the persecution coming and the people
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.560]   against you, and you'll be so dominated by it you'll deny me. Don't allow
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.520]   yourselves, he says, to be dominated by facts and circumstances. You've got to be
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.400]   masterful. Here's the essence of the whole of the biblical and the Christian
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.520]   teaching. Now, you see the relevance of all this today. It's very difficult, isn't
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.800]   it, to do this. Every newspaper you pick up, there it is. This same thing on the
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.160]   wireless television, discussions on it. These different programs make their
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.240]   investigations, tell us all about these bombs and their power, give us pictures
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.600]   and show people in America in shelters and so on, and here it is always on top
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.840]   of us. And the danger is, I say, we become dominated and we don't know where we are,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   and we become terrified and alarmed. Now, the whole object of Christian teaching
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.400]   is to deliver us from the tyranny and the thralldom and the domination of
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:18.860]   circumstances and events and facts. Secondly, having thus laid it down that we
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:24.560]   mustn't be dominated in that way, he then gets us to face the facts quite
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:31.760]   honestly and squarely. Far from that escapism or entertainment or anything
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.640]   else or this vague general comfort, he gets us to face the facts. There's no
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.720]   more realistic book in the world than the Bible. No man ever spoke more plainly
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.440]   to his followers than the Lord Jesus Christ. You remember a man came running
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.400]   after him one afternoon. He said, "I'm going to be your disciple. I'm going to
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.160]   follow wherever you go." "Wait a minute," says our Lord. "Foxes have holes and the
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.280]   birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head."
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.640]   You ready for that? He warns them. He says, "If they've hated me, they'll hate you. If
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.280]   they've called me Beelzebub, what shall they say about you? If they've done this
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.760]   in the green tree or stick, what shall they do in the dry?" Here it is, sheer
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:23.160]   realism. He gets them to face the facts honestly and squarely, and I've been
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.360]   trying to repeat this. Here is a book, I say, that far from promising us a life of
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.520]   ease and of happiness, and that Christianity is going to abolish war and
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.920]   bombs, and all the world's going to be happy and embracing one another, because
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.040]   there's a World Council of Churches or anything else that Christians are going
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.840]   to do. It says the exact opposite. "There shall be wars and rumors of wars."
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.080]   While men's a sinner, this world's going to be a difficult and a terrible place.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:18:00.680]   It's this present evil world. That's Christianity. You don't get that in your
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   newspapers. You don't get it anywhere except in this book. Thank God for
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.240]   something that's honest and that tells us the plain, unvarnished truth about
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.440]   ourselves and about life in this world. And then he goes on to the
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.920]   third point, which is this, that having thus now got us to face the thing and not
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.880]   run away or seek some escape somewhere, anywhere. He says, "There it is, look
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.160]   straight at it now." Then he says, "I'll teach you now how to think clearly about
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.840]   it. I'll show you now how to think right through, having seen the thing. I'll show
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.160]   you that there's a way to think right through it, so that you'll come out
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.800]   conquerors, and you won't be frightened and terrified, and you won't be
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.280]   dominated, but you'll stand on your feet and you'll follow me as men, and you'll
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.080]   go through to a final trial." Now that's it. He teaches them how to think in his
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.480]   own way. Now then, I sum it all up by putting it like this, therefore, that all
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:02.880]   fear and panic with respect to life and death is ultimately due to wrong
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:11.920]   thinking and a lack of understanding of certain vital truths. That's the
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.760]   principle. Running right through this whole discourse, even in the parable that
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:23.040]   he speaks at the end about that rich fool, wrong thinking, wrong thinking about
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.920]   these things and wrong understanding of certain vital truths is always the cause
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.280]   of panic, and of fear, of terror, and alarm, and of failure in life. Very well, there is
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:43.320]   how he puts it in general. Let us come to the particulars. Men's troubles, according
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.560]   to our Lord's teaching here and everywhere else, men's troubles, and
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   especially his fear of death, are due ultimately to an entirely false view
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:04.520]   which men takes of himself. That's his real trouble. Man's way of thinking about
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:11.240]   himself is so wrong that he tends to fail at all these various points, and
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:19.880]   ultimately fails entirely. How? Well, it works like this. Because men has a
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:27.400]   fundamentally wrong view of himself, he becomes concerned about the wrong
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:35.320]   problems, and spends his time in facing the wrong questions. That's his trouble.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.480]   You see, if you start with a wrong view of yourself, well, you'll be wrong
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.840]   everywhere else. And so, you see, man is led to concentrate on the things that
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.440]   are not really of primary importance, and to ignore the things that are of primary
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.120]   and of fundamental importance. Let me show you that. This is what I want to
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.600]   illustrate in detail, but do hold on to the principle. It's such a vital one.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.800]   What's your view of yourself? Very well, that's going to determine what you think
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.440]   about. And if you've got a wrong view of yourself, you'll be facing the wrong
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.240]   questions, you'll be concerned and alarmed about the wrong problems, and in
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.600]   the meantime, you'll not be considering the really important things at all.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.640]   Listen, here's the first way. Our Lord says here that a man in this condition,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.280]   dominated by the fear of death, is a man who thinks of himself only in terms of
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.840]   his body and not in terms of his soul. "Fear not them," he says, "which be not
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.160]   afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear. Fear him which, after he hath
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:49.640]   killed, hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say unto you, fear him." Now, the
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:55.040]   parallel passage in the Gospel according to St. Matthew, in chapter 10,
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.120]   puts it still more explicitly when he puts it like this. "Fear him which hath
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.960]   power to cast both soul and body into hell." It's here implicit, of course. He is
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.840]   "Fear him which, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell." What goes to
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.880]   hell? Well, it isn't the body, it's the soul. You'll find it there in Matthew's
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.920]   Gospel, chapter 10, and in verse 28. "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   able to kill the soul, but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:34.400]   and body in hell." It's a parallel statement, and here it is implicit here.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.640]   Now, this, I say, is the first way in which men, because he takes this wrong view of
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.080]   himself, goes wrong in his thinking. He thinks of himself only in terms of his
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.520]   body, and doesn't think at all about his soul. Now, if there was anything that is
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:55.080]   more true of the modern men than anything else, it is just this very thing.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:03.480]   We are living in a secular and in a materialistic age, and the result is that
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:10.760]   men thinks of himself only in terms of his body. It's the thing that is
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   obsessing the thinking of men at the present time. That's why there's all this
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.680]   concentration on death, you see, as I'm going to show you. It's the body, it's the
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.280]   life of the body they're thinking about, but it's true all round. There are so many
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:30.480]   in the world tonight who are interested in nothing but in pleasure, gratification
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.240]   of bodily desires. That's life to them, and that's life to them because that's
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.640]   men to them. What is men? Well, their idea of men is that he's some sort of an
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:47.280]   animal. They even boast of that. That's why they boast of evolution. Wonderful, to
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.880]   think that man's only an animal. And as an animal, well, of course, his business in
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.160]   this life and this world is to gratify his desires and his instincts. That's what
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.440]   they're doing. And that's the whole of their life. They're living only in terms
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.040]   of the body and the gratification of the various desires of the body. So they're
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:12.640]   concerned about nothing but pleasure, so-called, happiness, so-called. There are
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.760]   thousands of people like that. You see, that's why tonight, though the world is
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.960]   as it is, there are people sitting back and looking at their television sets and
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.240]   roaring with laughter at the tomfoolery and drunkenness and adultery and things
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:33.420]   like that. That's what explains that sort of lunacy, and all who in any way are
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.560]   living to the mere body and the gratification of their baser instincts.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.920]   But there are others of whom we can't say that, perhaps, if we are to be quite
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.560]   honest. We've got to grant that they're serious people. But still, there are many
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.640]   serious people who are not Christians, who are quite as materialistic in their
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.000]   outlook as those others. Not so blatant, not so obvious, but when you come to
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.400]   analyze it, it's exactly the same thing. Some of the most respectable people in
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.040]   the country tonight are purely materialistic and secular in their
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.580]   outlook. They've done well, they've got a wife and family, good bank balance, nice
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:16.160]   house, nice motor car. And the terrible thing is that these bums may take it all
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   from you, may lose it all. It isn't this open riotous pleasure, but it's equally
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.960]   secular, it's equally bodily, it's equally materialistic. It all really is
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:32.120]   concerned only about my life in this world and life as it expresses itself
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:39.080]   through the various faculties and powers of the body. Material possessions, this is
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.680]   what we are all interested in. Money, more wages, getting a fortune out of the
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.480]   football pools, this is wonderful. Everybody gets excited and thrilled, it's
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.160]   front-page news. Well, why? Well, because this is life, you see, to such people. The
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.800]   body, it's the life of the body, this world. And everything that can help the
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.960]   body, wonderful gadgets, machinery. Look at the adventures, isn't it wonderful? And
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.360]   we sit back and we enjoy it. Oh, what a pity, what a tragedy that these bums are
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.720]   coming and suddenly going to smash it all and take it all from us. That's the
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.560]   mentality, this materialistic outlook, thinking only in terms of the body and
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.360]   what the body can enjoy and what the body can do. Well, if you went even higher
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.400]   up the scale and came to your great philosophers, you'll find that they're in
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.760]   exactly the same category. They're not interested in anything, ultimately, except
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   the well-being of men in the body in this world. And all their thinking and all
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.160]   their arguing is concerned about that. Some of them want to bring in a utopia,
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.660]   the philosophers have always been trying to draw blueprints of utopia. It's been
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.540]   going on from the early days and has come down the centuries. But what is
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.540]   utopia? Well, utopia is nothing but life in this world. Perfect, if you can make it
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:59.220]   so. Get a perfect political state. Get a state in which there are no taxes and no
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.760]   work to do in the end, but everything works so harmoniously, no troubles, no
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   wars, utopia. Yes, but it's really only a life for the body and the
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:17.320]   gratification of the desires of the body. Isn't this true of men today? Isn't the
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.480]   whole of thinking determined by the body at this hour? Are not all the anxieties
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:29.560]   about this body of ours? And how little we hear about the soul. Men doesn't think
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.040]   about the soul, that's what our Lord is saying here. Don't fear those who can
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.400]   only kill the body. There's somebody who can send your soul to perdition. Here's
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.920]   the one to fear, why will the soul? What's this? What's the soul? Is there anybody in
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   this congregation who's never thought about the soul? If so, it means that you've
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.680]   only lived to your body. I don't care how much you've thought and how many books
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.280]   and philosophy you've read, if you've not been concerned about your soul, you've
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.960]   been thinking only about the body and living only for the body. What is the
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.000]   soul? Well, it's this inner man of ours. It's this immaterial, intangible
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.400]   something that is in us and a part of us. Something that we can't see, we can't
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:18.920]   analyze, but we know it's here. This is my being itself. This is that within me that
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:25.600]   is bigger than the world itself and bigger than life. This is that in men
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.880]   which enables him when he realizes it is in him and when he treats it as he
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.080]   should, that makes him independent of the world, that you can cut off all his
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.360]   pleasures, take away all his money, take everything, even life itself, he's still
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:45.080]   all right. The soul. What is it? Well, it's this within me that is ever crying out
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.440]   for an amplifier, a diviner air. It's that within me which tells me that
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:56.120]   duster what a dust returnist was not spoken of the soul. What are these
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.600]   aspirations that I know of, that I feel within me at times, that's something that
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.640]   tells me that I'm not a mere creature of time and that I'll go on forever and
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.360]   forever. Can you conceive of yourself as ending? You can't. Why can't you? Well,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.260]   because you got a soul in you. It's imperishable. It goes on. It's this part
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.360]   of men which is spiritual. It's this part of men that makes him dissatisfied, which
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.760]   makes him know when he's really thinking truly that if you gave him everything
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.560]   the world's got to give him, he'd still be dissatisfied, because money can't
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:31.280]   satisfy this. Nothing can, which comes solely to the body. He cries out for the
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.680]   living God, as a wise man puts it in the Old Testament in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.640]   He says, you know, this in a sense is the whole trouble with men. Thou hast put
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:48.400]   eternity within him, in his heart. And man has a vague awareness of this, a dim
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.160]   realization, that there is something within him which is bigger than
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.080]   this body, that he exists apart from the body, that he exists apart from things,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.280]   something that cries out for something bigger and beyond himself and beyond
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:10.400]   life, beyond men, and beyond the world. The soul. But the modern man doesn't think
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.760]   about his soul. He only thinks about the body. That's why he's terrified of death.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.960]   That's why he's so concerned and obsessed by the bombs. He's always
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.360]   looking at death. Death, well, because he knows nothing about the soul that is
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.800]   within him. That's his first error. And it all is due, you see, to a false view of
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.240]   himself. He regards himself as just a body. Everything, he says, can be explained
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.760]   in physical terms. Man is only a reasoning animal, after all, and even the
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.440]   brain is material, and thought is a kind of secretion of the brain. It's all
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:46.080]   physical, all material. And thus, you have your secular, materialistic outlook, and
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   the soul is forgotten. That's one thing. But let me hurry to a second. The second
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:57.000]   thing that it makes men do is this. It makes him think of himself solely in his
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.720]   relationship to men, and not at all in his relationship to God. Same thing, you
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.760]   see? Starts with this wrong view, and it leads him to that. So our Lord says, "I say
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.880]   to you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.480]   nothing that they can do." That's men. "But I will tell you, forewarn you whom ye
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.800]   shall fear. Fear him." This is God. This isn't the devil. The devil hasn't got the
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.760]   power of hell. It's God who has this. "Fear him, which after he hath killed hath
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:37.640]   power to cast into hell. Yea, I say unto you, fear him." This is the great message of
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.660]   the Bible. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. But we don't have it
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:49.640]   today. The world isn't interested. The world thinks of nothing but man, and all
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:56.680]   its fears and anxieties are due to its over-preoccupation with man, and what man
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.160]   can do. Isn't this true all round? Most people's lives are governed by what
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:07.600]   other people think. Even short of war, if there were no bombs, man would still be a
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.780]   slave because he'd be afraid what other people think. What will they say? What
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.380]   will they say if I do this? There are people who reject God because of that,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.220]   reject Christ. What will they say? What will they say at home? What will they say in the office?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.460]   Men. Fear of men. Man, you see, is what counts. The opinion of man. What's man
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:30.420]   going to say about me? And then what man's going to do to me? This is the
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.900]   serfdom and the slavery of modern men. He thinks he's shaken God off and he's
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:42.820]   become a slave to men. He lives constantly, I say, in terms of men. What
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:47.620]   they think, what they say, what they propose, what they may do. Man may suddenly
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.260]   send off these bombs and we're finished. Man, the power of man, what a terrible
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.940]   thing. And we're all obsessed by it and always thinking about it. Oh, it's tragic.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.820]   I rather like the way in which our Lord puts it here. Did you notice it? "Be not
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:06.980]   afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.780]   Isn't that wonderful? Have you ever thought of the limit to what men can do?
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.400]   "Oh, but look at these rockets," he said. "Look at how he's developed them. Look at the
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.620]   brilliant advances of this present year. Look how they're piling them up. What if
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.100]   they let... Look at the power of men, the power of bombs." Look at our Lord's
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:29.460]   contempt for it all. He just dismisses it all. This, which is being talked of so
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.860]   much and even preached about. Oh, may God have pity and compassion and mercy upon
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.380]   the modern church that spends its time in talking about men and what men can do.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.500]   Listen to our Lord's contempt. "They," he says, "can kill the body, but after that
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.980]   have no more that they can do." My dear friends, it's about time we begin to
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:55.660]   remind ourselves of what men can't do to us. Oh, I know he can destroy the body,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:02.900]   but thank God he can't touch the most precious things in life. Man has got no
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.680]   power to rob me of the most beautiful and the most wonderful things I've ever
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.960]   known. He can't touch them. All you've ever experienced when you've been at your best,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.380]   no man can rob you of those. There are certain golden hours in the life of
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:24.580]   every human individual. No bomb can rob you of those. The love of a dear one.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:29.660]   What you may have seen when you looked into the face of a little child. Or some
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:34.420]   beautiful view you had once of nature in her glory. No bombs can touch these
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.900]   things. These are imperishable. Man can't touch them. Why are you so afraid of men?
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.020]   He can only destroy the body. He can't touch these things, the highest, the
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.820]   noblest, the most wonderful things. He can't come near them. He's got no power of
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:53.100]   them. No more that he can do. I mustn't keep you. Work it out for yourselves. Oh,
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.660]   how foolish we are to be so afraid of men. Yes, but particularly when it leads us,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.400]   you see, to forget the other thing that matters, and that is the fear of God.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.100]   While the whole world is afraid of man and his power tonight, it doesn't give a
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:12.860]   thought to God. But this is what our Lord says, "Here's the one to fear. Him that
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:18.500]   after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say unto you, fear him.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:27.460]   Man can do nothing to your soul. He can't touch it. But here is one who deals with
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:34.420]   your soul. Here's the tragedy of today, the failure to think about God. My
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.660]   business is to preach about God, my friends, not about Khrushchev nor Kennedy,
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.260]   nor about men and their bombs, nor what the statesmen are doing. That's not my
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.980]   business. My business is to tell a world that's gone mad about God, God whom
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.940]   they've forgotten in their preoccupation with men. The church which preaches
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:59.460]   politics is denying her master's message. The greatest need of the world is to
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:05.200]   know about God, and what are we to know about him? Well, his all-mightiness. We are
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.900]   all in the hands of God. We are not in the hands of men, thank God, but we are
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:19.020]   in the hands of God. He made us, not we ourselves. He controls us. He can put an
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.620]   end to us at any moment. He can end the whole world whenever he likes. Everything
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.940]   is under his mighty, almighty control and power. Nothing happens apart from God.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.140]   Did you notice that even a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground without God?
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:38.340]   Everything. He's the maker, creator, sustainer, artificer, controller of the
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:44.780]   whole universe. And everybody and everything is in the hands of God. My
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:56.500]   life, my end, my times, my everything. Yes, but especially he is the judge, the judge
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:04.020]   eternal, the judge of the whole world, the judge of the whole earth. This is what
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.260]   people forget, and this is why all their thinking goes wrong. In their
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.380]   preoccupation with men, they forget that they've got to stand before God in the
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.300]   judgment. Now it's a message that is here in the Bible from the very beginning to
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:24.460]   the very end. Man, my friend, is a responsible being, and we shall all be
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:31.300]   held responsible by God. We've all got to stand before him in judgment. It is
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.340]   appointed unto all men once to die, and after death the judgment. What will you
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.980]   be judged on? Well, let me just put it like this. You will be judged in terms of
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.820]   what you've done with your soul. The soul is that which God put into men to make
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.100]   him like himself. He made in his own image and likeness. The soul, that's it. He
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.300]   gave us a soul, he made us a living soul. The judgment will be in terms of what have
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:59.060]   I done with my soul? God made it possible for me to have fellowship with him in
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.220]   communion. I was meant to represent him, to be Lord of creation. I was meant to
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.900]   enjoy his companionship and his company. I was meant to live entirely to his
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:13.460]   glory. That's the purpose of the soul, and I shall be judged in terms of that. And
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.900]   every one of us has got to face that judgment. Fear him which after he hath
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:27.740]   killed hath power. God's got the power. You can't escape the law of this land, you
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.500]   can't escape the law of God, it's infinitely more powerful. God is the
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.780]   lawgiver, he's the judge eternal, and you and I and every one of us will have to
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.020]   stand before God and give an account of the deeds done in the body. Every one of
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.660]   us is responsible, and every one of us will have to give an account, every one.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:53.020]   That's what the world doesn't think about at all. If only all men in the
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.540]   world realized tonight that they've got to stand before God and are held
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.980]   responsible and to give an account of their lives, all your problems would
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.300]   immediately disappear. We'd all fall down before him, and there'd be no war and no
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:10.940]   threat of war. The world has forgotten God in its preoccupation with men. It
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.620]   faces the wrong problems. Oh, what's man going to do to me? What's he going to do
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.740]   to my body? That's not the question. What about your soul? What about God who will
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:29.020]   judge the soul? And lastly, this central fallacy leads men to think of himself
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:37.540]   only in relationship to time, and not at all in his relationship to eternity, and
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:44.700]   so leads him to neglect the destiny of his soul. Be not afraid of them that
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.820]   kill the body, and after that that they have no more that they can do. They can
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.380]   kill your body, but they're finished then. They don't go beyond the grave. That's
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.900]   the last thing that men can do. He can destroy your body, and then he's finished.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.580]   He doesn't do anything once you've lost your life, once you're dead. He's finished.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:14.260]   Man can go no further. But there is one, I say, who goes further. There is one who
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.140]   can affect our eternal destiny. But man doesn't think about eternity. He thinks
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:24.100]   only in terms of time. And it is because he forgets his soul, and forgets God, and
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.980]   forgets eternity, that he's in misery and fear of death, and the bombs, and the
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.140]   killing of the body, and always talking about it, and thinking that
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:39.220]   Christianity's business is to save the body. It isn't. It's to save the soul. But
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.660]   this is how it works, isn't it? Man, forgetting these things, thinks only of
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:49.180]   life in this world. This world is the only world for him. See? That's why your
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.700]   old, infidel philosopher is so concerned about this. He doesn't know anything about
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:58.020]   life beyond the grave. He doesn't believe in a soul. He doesn't know about eternity.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:03.020]   So, of course, he's got to concentrate on preserving the body. It's his colossal
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.340]   ignorance. It's his blindness and darkness that leads him and all who
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.660]   follow him to do the same. They live only for life in this world. Existence in this
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.100]   world is the great thing, and death, it's the last calamity. It's a terrible thing,
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.320]   death. Why? Well, it's the end of everything, and there's nothing beyond. So, you see,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.820]   the supreme problem today is to save life in this world, to save the body, to
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:29.100]   save the life of the body, and to avoid death at all costs. Death is the last
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:36.880]   calamity. It's the last and the ultimate tragedy. That's how man thinks. And he
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:44.940]   doesn't think at all about eternity. But, my dear friend, eternity is the real fact.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:50.500]   This is a world of shadows. This is a world of appearances. This is only a
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.780]   temporary world. This is the world of the things that are seen. The things that are
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.700]   seen are temporal. The things that are not seen are eternal. This is but a shadowy
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:05.380]   world, a transitory world. The real world is the world that is unseen, the spiritual
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:12.780]   and eternal realm. Our Lord directs attention to that, you see, not time. Time
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:17.980]   wasn't a big thing to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It was eternity. He
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:24.660]   was only in this world about 33 years. What is time? It's nothing. It's only a
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.500]   stage, a transitory stage of preparation. It's eternity that matters. Why? Well,
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:35.740]   because eternity is endless. This life at best is not endless. Even if you abolish
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.340]   war and bombs, we'd still have to die. It's a transient, temporary world. We are
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:48.620]   but strangers in Pilgrimshire. But eternity is endless. No end at all. And man, when he
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:56.260]   dies, goes on into eternity. Yes, and remember that in eternity, says our Lord,
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:02.740]   there are two possibilities. When you stand before the Judge Eternal, when you
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.500]   stand before God, you'll be sent one direction or the other. There are only
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:19.020]   two, but there are two. Hell and heaven. Fear him, which after he hath killed hath
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:26.900]   power to cast into hell. My dear friends, this isn't my teaching. How can I know
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.500]   about these things? I'm simply repeating to you the teaching of the Son of God,
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:37.340]   the teaching which is in this book from beginning to end. Heaven and hell. What is
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:42.340]   hell? Well, here it is. You see, he hath power to cast into hell, or as the
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:48.900]   Parallel puts it in Matthew 10, 28, hath power to destroy both soul and body in
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:56.820]   hell. What is hell? Well, the Apostle Paul talks about it as the enduring eternal
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.020]   destruction from the presence of the Lord. It's to be outside the life of God
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.540]   endlessly, everlastingly. Our Lord says it's a place where there shall be wailing
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.220]   and gnashing of teeth. I'm not saying that. It's Christ who said it. It's the Son
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.940]   of God. If you know better, well, I've no more to say to you. That's what he said.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.820]   He was incarnate love. Look at him. Look at his person. Look at his deeds. He has
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.700]   incarnate love. Here is God in the flesh. It was he who said that there is the
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.740]   place where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. He says it's a place
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:36.580]   where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. He describes it in Luke
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:42.540]   16, in his parable of Dives and Lazarus, as a place of torment, a kind of flame,
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:48.340]   an agony of its suffering. And what is more terrible still is this. In that same
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:57.060]   parable he teaches this, that there is no hope of change. The rich man Dives, in
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:03.820]   hell, lifted up his face and he saw poor Lazarus, the tramp, in Abram's bosom
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:09.540]   enjoying great happiness. And here was he, in hell, suffering. He says, "Can't I come
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.500]   there?" The answer that was given him was this, "There's a great gulf fixed. No
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:21.020]   traffic between hell and heaven. It's your eternal destiny. It goes on forever and
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.900]   forever, without end, without intermission, without ever a hope of
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:31.420]   change. It's this sort of world, but ten times worse, and going on and on and on,
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:41.480]   forever and forever and forever, without any end, ever, ever. Hell. If you want to
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:49.700]   fear, says our Lord, fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:56.180]   hell. Who will he cast there? All those who haven't lived to his glory? All those
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.580]   who've despised the soul that is within them and have lived only for the body?
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:05.980]   All those who've broken his holy laws and have spat in his face and have prided
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.180]   themselves in their knowledge and their understanding and have refused his
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:14.660]   revelation? They're the ones that go there. And that's the kind of place to
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:20.420]   which they go. The modern world doesn't think about it. It thinks about bombs. But
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.500]   what can the bomb do? Well, at the worst, all it can do is to put an end to the
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.100]   life of my body. It can't do any more. The bomb can kill me, but it can't do any
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.900]   more to me. But here, I'm confronted with something that can affect my everlasting
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.780]   and eternal destiny, and put me in a place called hell, forever and forever,
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.780]   without any hope of ever getting out, or any relief or intermission. That's the
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:46.740]   thing to fear. But thank God I don't have to leave it at that. There's another
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:54.460]   possibility. Why fear him who has power to throw me into hell? Well, because he can
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.580]   also tell me to go to heaven, to the other place. What is this? Oh, who can
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.060]   describe it? We can't. It's beyond any imagination. It baffles every
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.780]   description. It means to be with Christ. It means to be with God. It means to be
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.460]   with the holy angels and the spirit of just men made perfect. It's a place where
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.620]   there is no sorrow. There is no sin. There is no weeping. There is no remorse and
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.820]   repentance. There's no unhappiness. There is no selfishness. There is no war. There
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:30.860]   is no unhappiness. It is everlasting glory. It is eternal bliss. That's the
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.300]   other possibility. But the world isn't interested. The world is so concerned
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.460]   about preserving its little life in this world, that it's not thinking at all
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.220]   about the everlasting and eternal destiny of itself. Having a good time
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.580]   here, knowing nothing about having a good time, if you like, throughout all the
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:52.540]   countless ages of eternity. Isn't this tragic? That's why men are so afraid of
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:57.180]   bombs and so afraid of death. They know nothing about the glories of heaven and
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.980]   about the glories of eternity. Didn't you sing that hymn with meaning just now?
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.460]   Let me remind you of what it tells you. This is the Christian attitude. The
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:09.580]   Christian is a man you see is not afraid of death for this reason. That he knows
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.700]   that death and all that it has, has been conquered once and forever. He is no
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.940]   longer living in a state of terror because of these things. Let me remind
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.420]   you what you were singing just now. How easy it is to sing, how difficult to
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:32.660]   believe. Jesus lives. Thy terrors now can o'er death no more appall us. Jesus lives, by
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:41.500]   this we know, thou, O grave, canst not enthrall us. Jesus lives, henceforth is
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.940]   death. What is it? Some people are terrified and alarmed and do everything, even deny
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.740]   Christ in order to evade it. Not at all. Jesus lives, henceforth is death, but the
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.900]   gate of life immortal. This shall come, our trembling breath, when we pass its
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:04.140]   gloomy portal. Jesus lives, for us he died. Then alone to Jesus living, pure in heart,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.100]   may we abide. Glory to our Savior giving. Here it is, Jesus lives, our hearts know
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.100]   well, not from his love shall sever. Life nor death, nor powers of hell, let me add,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:19.820]   nor bonds, nor war, nor man at his damnedest can touch us, tear us from his
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:27.700]   keeping, never. Jesus lives, to him the throne over all the world is given. May
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:38.980]   we go where he is gone, rest and reign with him, in him. Oh, the tragedy of being
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:44.100]   so obsessed by time that we forget eternity and the two dread possibilities.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:49.000]   And finally, you see, it leads to this, that many ignore and deny and reject the
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.300]   only one who can save our souls and deliver us from the fear of hell and
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:50:01.860]   ensure us of a safe arrival in heaven. This is how Christ puts it. Whosoever
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:07.540]   loveth his life in this world shall lose it, but whosoever hateth his life in this
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:14.380]   world shall keep it unto life eternal. That's his teaching. But look at him
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:20.260]   himself. There you see the teaching incarnated in his blessed person. What if
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.140]   he had thought that the death of the body was the last calamity? What if he'd
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.420]   done everything to avoid being put to death? We'd all go to hell, we'd all be
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:35.820]   damned, we'd all be without a hope. But he didn't think of himself. The death of the
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:43.200]   body was not to him the last calamity. He came into the world in order to die, to
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:52.740]   give his life a ransom for many. Thank God he knew, who for the joy that was set
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:58.340]   before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is now set at the right
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.340]   hand of God in the glory. No, no, defense of the body, keeping the body, life in
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:09.620]   this world, was not to him everything. Thank God he laid down his life, not to
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:17.220]   preserve the lives of our bodies, but to preserve and to save our souls and make
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:24.740]   us heirs of that everlasting bliss and that eternal glory. My dear friend, what's
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:30.020]   your view of yourself? Are you thinking only of your body? Are you thinking only
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:37.740]   of men? Are you thinking only of time? Listen to the Lord Jesus Christ, the soul,
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:49.500]   God, eternity, and then think of him. He came to save you from the possibility of
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:54.780]   hell. He died that you might be forgiven. He died to make you a child of God and
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:52:01.380]   an heir of this eternal glory. He gave his body to be broken willingly, readily,
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:11.780]   his blood to be shed, that you and I might be insured of dwelling in the
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:22.500]   glories of everlasting life with him and with his Father. What a tragedy that men
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:28.100]   should be so negligent, I say, of the soul and of God and of time, that they reject
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.780]   this Christ and deny him and don't realize what they're doing. They're
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.420]   afraid of the wrong thing. They're afraid of men. They're afraid of the death of
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:43.340]   the body. They're not afraid of God. They're not afraid of hell. They're not
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:49.940]   afraid of eternal misery for their immortal soul. Is it clear to you, my
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:57.220]   friend? Well, if so, turn to God, acknowledging your folly. Realize the
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:02.740]   importance of the soul. Humble yourself before God, acknowledge and confess your
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:10.260]   sin, and believe his message concerning his dear Son, in and through whom and his
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:16.100]   death he offers you complete forgiveness and pardon, a new life, a new nature to
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.780]   lead you through the rest of your life in this world, and finally to receive you
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:25.660]   into an everlasting habitation. Amen.
