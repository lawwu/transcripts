[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.540]   And in this episode, I want to talk about whether this is as good as it gets.
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.360]   Things are really good right now.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.180]   We've got the S&P 500 up about 20% year to date.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.400]   We get to borrow at a negative real interest rate.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   So in other words, when inflation is higher than the interest cost, you saw November CPI
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.020]   come in at 6.8%.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.840]   If you take out a 3% mortgage, your negative real interest rate is 3.8%.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.060]   And that's just like getting paid to borrow money while your asset goes up.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.940]   And then finally, we've got IBON returns guaranteed by the government at 7.14% through April 22,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.940]   2022.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.720]   And then it just changes based on whatever the index is after that.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.120]   So 7.14% is a positive real return and it's also guaranteed.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.260]   So on the one hand, you got guaranteed positive real returns and you can borrow at negative
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.260]   real interest rates.
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760]   That is a tremendous combination that everybody needs to take advantage of.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.700]   You can only buy $10,000 worth of IBONs per person.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.740]   And if you have a business, you can buy $10,000 as well.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.360]   So theoretically, if it was you two, a couple, and you both each had businesses, you could
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.700]   buy $40,000 worth of IBONs in December of one year and another $40,000 in January of
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.840]   the next year.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.240]   So that adds up pretty quickly, right?
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   That's $80,000 where you can get a 7.14% return.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.220]   That's like getting $5,600 of guaranteed money.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.700]   So let me talk a little bit further about what negative real mortgage rates means.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.360]   That means to me, at least over the next 6 months, probably 12 months, that there's going
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.780]   to be a tremendous tailwind in the real estate market.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.000]   If you're getting paid to borrow money, you're going to borrow more money.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.180]   And if you already have a lot of debt or any debt, the rational thing to do is to hold
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.000]   on to that debt as long as possible instead of paying down extra principal.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.040]   Now don't get me wrong.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.940]   I think paying down debt over time is a good thing.
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.800]   We should all strive to be debt free by the time we are maybe 60, no longer want to work
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.680]   or are unmotivated.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.760]   However, debt enables you to live a better life than you could have otherwise because
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   it allows you to buy things beyond what your cash can afford.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.240]   So I've paid off a mortgage before.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.080]   I think it was in 2015 on a mortgage I took out in 2003.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.560]   And I don't regret paying it off at all, even though I could have made more money in the
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640]   stock market, real estate market and other alternative assets.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.280]   I never really regret paying down debt.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.440]   However, if you want to try to optimize as much of your cash as possible, you should
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.720]   think about the debt interest rate relative to returns and relative to the inflation rate.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.920]   So unless you have a lot of cash just lying around, I wouldn't pay down extra debt right
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   now.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.000]   But if you do have a lot of cash, well, just know that it is also getting pounded by inflation
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   as well.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.640]   So 6.8% November inflation number.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   If you had $100,000 in cash, it basically buys about 6.8% less today than what it could
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.240]   have bought a year ago.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.040]   And given our finances are always fluid and the market is always fluid, I do recommend
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.880]   you follow my FSDAIR framework.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.680]   FSDAIR framework that talks about how much to invest and how much to pay down debt if
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.160]   you want to do both.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   And so for example, if you've got debt interest rate at 2%, I would use 20% of your free cash
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.940]   flow to pay down debt and 80% to invest or hold on.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.080]   I don't think negative real interest rates or negative real mortgage rates are going
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.860]   to last much longer than two years.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.960]   And I say two years because I think in 2022, the inflation rate normalizes from about 6.8%
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.760]   down to about 4%.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.840]   And then in 2023, it normalizes down to about 3% or 2%.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   So as the inflation rate comes down, and maybe mortgage rates go up, maybe because mortgage
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   rates have not really gone up over the past several months, then you'll see a normalizing
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.080]   of the real interest rate.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.800]   However, based on my forecast, that still means the vast majority of debtors or mortgage
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.260]   borrowers are going to have negative real mortgage rates for the next 24 months.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.940]   So in such a scenario, it still provides a positive tailwind for any asset class which
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.260]   requires or is commonly bought with debt.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.980]   Therefore, I still remain very positive on real estate.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.620]   Now let's talk about IBON returns.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.180]   7.14% through April 2022.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.460]   And it might go up or it might go down.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.860]   But either way, it's probably going to be somewhere similar, right?
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.260]   I don't think this supply chain issue and inflation is going to change that quickly,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.360]   but it might.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.800]   So another way to look about a 7.14% IBON return is that your investments need to earn
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.920]   higher than 7.14% or else why bother?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.340]   Why even get out of bed?
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.060]   Why even be an active manager or manage your money?
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.420]   Because you can just earn risk-free 7.14%.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.940]   You need that risk premium.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.740]   So the way to also think about it is, well, maybe risk assets will definitely return more
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.120]   than 7.14% in 2022 or at least through April 2022, because investors are all in cahoots.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.060]   Everything is relative to the risk-free rate.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.840]   Now the true risk-free rate is more like the 10-year bond yield because you can purchase
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.820]   unlimited amounts of the 10-year bond.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.200]   However, looking at the IBON return of 7.14% is a fair risk-free rate as well, at least
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.020]   for a portion of your capital.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.420]   So all this is to say that we should probably stay long mostly in risk assets in 2022, even
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.500]   though the Fed is tightening and valuations are high.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.420]   Now let's not be naive and expect no correction of 10%, 20% over the next 12 months.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.580]   When you see individual stocks get slaughtered, like in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, a lot
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.180]   of stocks are down 30%, 40%, 50% while the index is trading off only maybe about 5% from
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.600]   its all-time high.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.780]   So just be careful regarding investing in richly valued assets in 2022.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.260]   Instead of going for triples and home runs, I think we all need to be disciplined to try
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.420]   to preserve the capital we have gained, especially since 2020, and we should try to look for
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.020]   singles, not even doubles, singles.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.860]   Singles where if you're at the top of the lineup, you hit the singles so someone can
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.220]   clean you up, or singles to just advance the runner and just keep the line moving and keep
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.740]   the momentum going.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.140]   One of the worst things that could happen is if you round trip your investments.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.680]   So round trip means it goes up and then it goes all the way back down to where you bought
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.900]   it for during this pandemic, because for most people, the pandemic has negatively affected
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   their lives.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   It certainly has mine.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   I haven't traveled as much.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   I haven't seen my family.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.180]   There's, you know, my kids have to wear masks at school.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.740]   It generally is a net huge negative.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.500]   But the one positive has been that we've been able to make money or investors have been
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   able to make money during the pandemic.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.940]   So if you go through a negative in life because of the pandemic, and then you end up round
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.820]   tripping your investments and losing those gains, then you're going to be really, really
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.820]   upset.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.900]   So please don't let that happen to you.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.700]   Focus on risk control and focus on appropriate asset allocations going forward.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.700]   All right.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.700]   That's it for this episode.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.940]   If you enjoyed this episode and it has made you think about being a better investor, I'd
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.940]   appreciate a positive review.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.900]   I read them all and it keeps me motivated.
