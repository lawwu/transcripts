[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.340]   All right.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.840]   We have a question here from Jenny.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.640]   Jenny says, how do you suspect that you're
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.400]   thinking about living a deep life will change in retirement?
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.040]   Well, I don't think it will change at all.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.000]   And what I mean by that is I don't think my general framework
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   for thinking about the deep life has
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.120]   to change in any substantial way as you shift from full-time work
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.480]   to retirement.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480]   The decisions and activities that this framework generates
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.600]   will, of course, change as you shift from full-time work
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.560]   to retirement.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   So just as a reminder, my framework for the deep life
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.560]   says you identify the buckets that
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.120]   are important to you and your life
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.660]   and your vision of a life well-lived,
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.840]   and you give each of these buckets independent attention.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.840]   You start with keystone habits, and then you
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.280]   overhaul that part of your life.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   And so you make sure that you're seeing holistically
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.360]   all the elements of your life that are important
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.400]   and that you're giving intention to each of those
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.320]   and making sure that they have a expression in your life
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.240]   and they're an important part of your life.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.400]   So what happens when you retire?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.120]   It just changes what you're doing in some of those buckets.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.000]   In particular, you have what I call the craft bucket,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.960]   the bucket that's dedicated to work.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440]   That's going to look a lot different after retirement.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160]   Craft is still important, producing things
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.800]   of value, skill is still important,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.280]   but you'll probably then be pushing
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.400]   that part of your life towards more
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.480]   non-professional type craft.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.040]   And the other buckets of your life
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.720]   remain unchanged, just as important
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.560]   as they ever were before.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020]   Probably most of the stuff you were
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.440]   doing the day before you retired in those other buckets
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.320]   you'll be doing the day after.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.640]   Your constitution bucket for your health and well-being,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.160]   that's still important, obviously.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.720]   Community, what you're doing with your friends and family
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.800]   and those who live around you, going
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   to be just as important.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.520]   It doesn't change when you retire.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.320]   Contemplation, thinking through philosophical or theological
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680]   issues is just as important before and after.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.840]   So I think if you're living with this bucket-based approach
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440]   to the deep life, it will be a seamless transition
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   to retirement.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.840]   When you do your normal introspection
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.400]   on each of those buckets, your craft bucket will change,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.200]   the other ones won't, and you keep going,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.160]   you keep living deeply.
