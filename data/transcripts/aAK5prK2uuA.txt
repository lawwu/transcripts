[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   A question has come in from a listener who asks this, "Pastor John, Jesus tells us
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.440]   to pray this line in the Lord's Prayer, 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.920]   us from evil.' So how are we delivered from evil, and how does He save us from
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.800]   temptation?" The primary strategy of the devil—and I think when it says "delivers
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.480]   from evil," it probably does mean the evil one, but it works either way because he's
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.680]   behind every temptation. The primary strategy of the devil is to deceive us.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.120]   That's his—he's primarily a deceiver. Revelation 12:9, "The great dragon was
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.320]   thrown down, that ancient serpent who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.360]   of the whole world." That's Revelation 12:9. And John 8:44, "When he lies, he speaks
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   out of his own nature." So the strategy of the devil in bringing about
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:19.480]   temptation and evil is to deceive us. Put thoughts in your mind or feelings in
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.560]   your soul that are false. He lies to us about where happiness is best to be
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.200]   found. So how does Jesus ask the Father to deliver us? And we have another prayer,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600]   interestingly enough, besides the Lord's Prayer, and Jesus prays the same thing,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.320]   only he expands it and answers the question. Compare John 17 to the Lord's
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.680]   Prayer, and here's what John 17 Jesus prays, "I do not ask that you take them
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.240]   out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one." And then verse 17,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.520]   "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." Now that should not be a surprise
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.280]   to us that he says to the Father, "Father, there's an evil one out there. His primary
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.520]   strategy is deceit. Please guard them from that evil one, and here's the way I
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.920]   think you should do it." Like the son could tell the father how to do it.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.280]   Namely, in the truth. Make them holy in the truth. Your word is truth. So,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   sanctify means help them be holy and conquer temptation by being holy. How? In
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.600]   your truth, by truth. More specifically, your word. Not just vague truth, any old
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.760]   truth, but your word is truth. Those promises that God has made to us and
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.440]   those facts about life and about his way and his being. So, by your word, what is
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.240]   that? Well, the antidote to every falsehood are the truths of Scripture.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.280]   In fact, I would say there is no remedy, none for falsehood, other than truth.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.240]   None. So, if falsehood is the modus operandi of the evil one by which he
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   tempts and destroys us, there is only one remedy, and that is the opposite of
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.680]   falsehood, and that is truth. So, when the word is proclaimed, Matthew 13, 19 says,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.640]   "When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.000]   evil one comes and snatches away the word." Well, what else would he do, right? So, we
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.960]   have to be so vigilant. I'm not going to let Satan have the word in my heart. I'm
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.880]   gonna believe it, gonna hold on to it, gonna say it over and over again. I'm
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   gonna nullify his deceit in my life. So, how does God deliver us from evil and
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.240]   from temptation? I'll just give you three verses from the Bible that show how he
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.600]   does it. Number one, Hebrews 3, 13, "Exhort one another every day as long as it is
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.960]   called today that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." So, the
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.000]   answer of how we are delivered, we're delivered by the church. "Exhort one
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.360]   another every day lest you be deceived." Number two, "Put off your old self." This
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.560]   is Ephesians 4, 22. "Put off your old self which belongs to your former manner of
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.960]   life which is corrupt through deceitful desires." So, desires lie to you. You've got
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.640]   to tell the truth about your desires. And so, "Put on the new man." And what is he?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.440]   "Renewed in the spirit of your mind." Mind's filled with what? Verse 24, "Put on
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.400]   the new self, created after the likeness of God in righteousness and holiness in
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.160]   the truth." We conquer the old self with its deceitful desires by filling our
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   minds with the truth, the precious, infinitely valuable, Christ-exalting
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.880]   truth of Scripture. And the last one is 1 Peter 1, 14, "As obedient children, do not
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.560]   be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance." Where did your old
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.840]   passions come from? You were stupid. You didn't have any eyes to see Christ as
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.040]   beautiful and superior over all the temptations. So, kill that ignorance with
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.680]   what? You can only kill ignorance with one thing—knowledge and truth. So, when
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.840]   Jesus prayed, "Lead them not into temptation, deliver us from evil," He
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   clarified in John 17, "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." God
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.960]   delivers me and you from evil by saturating us with the Word, and we
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   ought to join Him in it. Beautiful. Thank you, Pastor John. And this question maps
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.440]   on to the question that we have for tomorrow. If Jesus did not have a sin
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.680]   nature, if there wasn't a sinful flesh in Him, something inside of Him that made
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   temptations even more alluring, like we have, can He really be said to sympathize
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.560]   with us when it comes to understanding the power of our temptations? In other
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.360]   words, are the temptations we face more powerful than those faced by Christ on
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.000]   earth? Hmm. That's tomorrow. I'm your host Tony
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Rehnke. We'll see you then.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.660]   you
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.720]   you
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
