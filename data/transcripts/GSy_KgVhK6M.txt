[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Chris from South Carolina writes in with a really good question. "Pastor John,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.520]   hello. If Jesus grew spiritually," and then he cites Luke 2 52, an amazing
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   reference that Jesus did grow spiritually, "spiritual growth in its
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.160]   essence must be marked by something other than sinning less. So what is the
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.120]   essence or perhaps the goal of spiritual growth that sinless Jesus was moving
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.480]   toward?" What would you say to Chris? Excellent question. So let me put a
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.960]   couple more passages of Scripture alongside Luke 2 52 so we can see how
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.280]   crucial the question really is. Luke 2 52 says, "And Jesus increased in wisdom
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.360]   and in stature and in favor with God and man." So this is where Chris sees
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.040]   growth in Jesus' spiritual life. He increased, he increased in wisdom and he
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.880]   increased in favor with God and so on. So there was some kind of movement, some
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.800]   kind of growth, as Chris says. Now let's add to Luke 2 52, Hebrews 2 10. "It was
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.280]   fitting that he, God, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.040]   to glory, that he should make the founder of their salvation perfect through
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.280]   suffering." So here we have God making Jesus perfect through suffering. So Jesus
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   is in some sense moving toward perfection. And here's the one other
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.920]   verse, Hebrews 5 8 and 9. "Although he was a son," although Jesus was a son of
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.960]   God, "he learned obedience," catch that phrase, "he learned obedience through what
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.040]   he suffered, and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.280]   to all who obey him." So if you put all those together, you have Jesus increasing
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.040]   in wisdom, increasing in favor with God and man, being made perfect through
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.080]   suffering, learning obedience through what he suffered. And so Chris's question
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.880]   is basically, what does all that mean if Jesus never sinned and therefore could
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.000]   not progress from a state of some sinning to no sinning? Or to be more
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.560]   specific, what does it mean to learn obedience or to be made perfect? And why,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.400]   Chris asks, did Jesus pass through this? What's the goal? What is he
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   moving toward if he's not ever sinning? So let's make sure that neither Chris, I
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.480]   presume, nor I, neither of us is just arbitrarily assuming that Jesus never
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.440]   sinned. Like, we've got a theology that he's sinless, and we're just gonna assume
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.680]   that he never sinned, and we're not gonna let these texts change our mind no
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.440]   matter what they say. No, no, no, no, no. We're not assuming this. We are reading it in
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.280]   the book of Hebrews. That's what makes it so significant. Hebrews, probably more
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.120]   than any other book in the New Testament, insists upon the sinlessness of Jesus.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   For example, Hebrews 4:15, "We do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.440]   with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect was tempted as we are, yet
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   without sin." Same thing in 726, same thing in 914. So we're not assuming Jesus was
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.960]   sinless. The writer who said he learned obedience said he never sinned. So he has
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.720]   created the problem, not us, and we're just trying to get inside the Bible
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   writer's head. What does it mean to be perfected or to learn obedience? And
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:09.240]   here's my suggestion. He learned obedience means that Jesus moved from
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   untested obedience into suffering, and then through suffering into tested and
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.720]   proven obedience. If you think about it, if you're good enough, you can learn a
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.240]   new task without failing. And the new task that Jesus had to learn every hour,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.520]   especially at the end of his life, was, "Can I endure this suffering that I have
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   never experienced before, this new obedience that I have never performed
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.200]   before in the history of the universe, can I learn and do this perfectly without
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   failing, without falling into unbelief and murmuring?" And the answer of Hebrews
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.720]   is, "Yes!" He could, and he did. He learned obedience in what he suffered, and he
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:17.440]   never, never, never failed once in the process of perfect learning, proven, tested
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   obedience. In other words, in all of Jesus' suffering, he was being tested. Would he
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:33.480]   add obedience to obedience until he had grown into the complete, perfect, tested
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.920]   manâ€”that is, the man who had been fully and completely proven and who had
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:49.320]   responded with perfect obedience so that he could be described as fully perfected?
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.560]   Not meaning that he passed from sinfulness to sinlessness, but that he
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:05.000]   passed from untested obedience to fully tested obedience. And I think the
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.480]   answer to Chris's question about what Jesus was moving toward is not merely
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.720]   that he was moving toward a completely tested perfection, but that he was moving
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.600]   toward fulfilling a perfect salvation for us sinners. Remember, Hebrews 2:10 goes
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.880]   like this, "It was fitting that he for whom and by whom all things exist in
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.400]   bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.320]   through suffering." In other words, Jesus was fulfilling everything that the Father
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:47.040]   saw as fitting in becoming a Savior for sinners. Where we failed in our test,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.920]   someone must completely succeed and then offer himself as the founder of our
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.160]   salvation so that if we trust him and we're united to him, his success in
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:07.200]   becoming a perfectly obedient person is counted as our obedience and our success.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.560]   And there's one more clue in Hebrews 2:10 in answer to Chris's question about
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.880]   what's the ultimate goal? What's Jesus up to? What's God up to in putting Jesus
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.600]   through this learning of obedience through suffering? And the answer is,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.160]   it is ultimately for the glory of God. Listen again. "For it was
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:41.120]   fitting for God, for whom all things exist, for whom are all things, it was
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   fitting for that particular God to bring many sons to glory by perfecting Christ
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.480]   through sufferings." In other words, there was something about God's doing it this
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:02.560]   way that was peculiarly fitting for God to get the maximum glory for whom all
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   things exist. So this is the way of saving sinners that would show that all
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.360]   things, including the death of Christ, are done for the sake of the glory of God.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:23.060]   And that's exactly the connection Jesus makes between his obedience and the
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:30.040]   Father's glory in John 17.4. He says, "I glorified you, Father, on earth, having
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.600]   accomplished the work you gave me to do." So my ultimate answer to Chris's
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.720]   question as to why Christ grew and why he learned obedience and why he was
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.860]   perfected through suffering is that beyond becoming a perfect Savior for us,
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:56.840]   which he did, he also glorified God more fully than any other way of salvation
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.320]   would have done. Amen, that is glorious truth in some really amazing and
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.640]   profound New Testament texts. Thank you, Pastor John. Well, July is fast
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.240]   approaching, and that means for those of us in the States, Independence Day is
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.520]   fast approaching as well, and tomorrow we're gonna step back from this really
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   crazy political season to look at the topic of patriotism in the Christian
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.700]   life. I am your host Tony Ranke, thanks for listening to the podcast and for
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.400]   making it a part of your daily routine. Pastor John and I will see you tomorrow.
