[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.040]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.560]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   I'm your host.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.560]   Today is Friday.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.000]   That means we have a live Friday Q&A show.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.520]   The way these shows work, just like call and talk radio, you can call in and talk to Dave
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   Ramsey or you can call in and talk to me.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.120]   Call in and talk to Dave Ramsey, you get about a minute and a half and you get through tens
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.520]   of thousands of callers or you can talk to me, in which case sometimes I've been known
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.200]   to give people 45 minutes worth of show.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.680]   So I hope you'll join me next week.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.880]   If you'd like to join me for next week's Q&A call, sign up to support the show on Patreon.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.040]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance and you
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.840]   will find me there.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240]   We begin with Hap in California.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   Hap, welcome to the show.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.240]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.880]   Hap Ramsey, CFO Alphabet and Google: Hey, good to talk to you, Joshua.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   Personally, I'm glad to be talking to you and not to Dave Ramsey.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.480]   I will try to not take 45 minutes of your time.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   I'll just try to keep it short.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.440]   Well, two quick things.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.920]   The first thing is just to share I'm a little bit elated right now because I wasn't even
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.280]   planning this, but I just had a conversation with my boss this morning where I asked him
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.080]   for a raise and got it and I'm just really happy about that.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.760]   And I wanted to share because I feel like the path to developing myself and increasing
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.080]   my confidence and all that to be able to be in this place is a lot of it, not all of it,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.160]   but a lot of it I kind of credit to listening to you on this show, honestly.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.240]   So I just wanted to say I really appreciate you for that.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   Thank you.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   Thank you.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   Tell us how you did it.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.920]   What were some of the steps that you've been taking at work, some of the things that you've
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.880]   been doing in your personal life, and when did you come to the point of being willing
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   to ask for a raise?
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.080]   Well, a big piece of it is I have a really, really good relationship with my boss, which
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.160]   I mean, he's a really good guy and I know I'm outside of work too and have him.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.480]   So the decision to leave my old job to work for him actually came at the beginning with
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.280]   a decrease in pay, sort of more of a startup situation.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.680]   But just being young and having the confidence and I guess the vision to see the longer term
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   potential upside was kind of a risk to take at the beginning, but now it's sort of paying
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   off.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.240]   And he's just really encouraged me to do a really intentional job of evaluating myself
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.000]   consistently actually in terms of the dollar amount that I bring to the company.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.840]   And he's always had a pretty good rule of just giving me as a rule of thumb of if you
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.320]   can provide 3x of whatever you [inaudible] that number is divided by three and that's
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.800]   always something that you can be confident and feeling deserving of in terms of being
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.360]   an employee.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.320]   So that's just been my mindset for the past, ever since I've had this job really.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   And so he's been open about giving me the space to pursue these types of conversations
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.800]   and book time with him to chat through those things and he's been open with me.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   But it's still scary to ask the question and I'm still growing through that.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.520]   But yeah, does that sort of give you a bit of a margin?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   Yeah, it does.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.600]   And what I'll just affirm to you and to every other listener is simply this.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   The most difficult thing that a business owner, a boss, an employer generally has to do is
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.640]   to find high quality employees.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   It's very difficult.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.400]   Employees spend, employers spend a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of effort
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   to find high quality employees.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   It's very difficult.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.360]   Even something simple, right?
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   And I'd encourage you if you've never hired somebody, try to figure out how to hire somebody.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.400]   If you need to hire a housekeeper, hire somebody simple in your life and you start to see things
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.720]   from the other side.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.000]   It's very difficult for an employer to find really high quality employees.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And it's also very risky for an employer to find very high quality employees because there's
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.840]   a process, kind of the courting process so to speak, when you're trying to attract an
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.200]   employee to your firm.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.800]   Yes, you're going to need to know them but you have to sort through, you have to advertise
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.320]   for the job or get the word out in some way, start to collect resumes and applications.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   You have to interview lots of people and there's a good chance that people in that interview
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.100]   process are, some are probably telling you flat out lies.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.040]   Everybody is selling themselves to the best, the very best way possible.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   They're trying to make themselves seem like the best fit.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.440]   And so there's a good chance that you might get it wrong and it's very hard for companies
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   to get it wrong.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.720]   There's a lot of time and expense associated.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.960]   And I mean just look at the amount of money that a company will pay to a recruiter.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.280]   I can't remember the exact percentages off the top of my head but I would guess it's
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.300]   at least 50% of the first year salary, depending on the industry, depending on the job.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.240]   But if someone's going to hire somebody, they'll pay a recruiter a significant sum of money.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.320]   Let me not put percentages out that I don't actually know.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.480]   A significant sum of money and I wouldn't be surprised to hear a recruiter say, "Yeah,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.160]   I get 50%," some more of the first year salary is a finder's fee.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.880]   So just imagine that if your boss is going to pay you X number of thousands of dollars,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.800]   they're also going to pay someone else X numbers of thousands, tens of thousands of dollars
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   to get somebody.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   And so it's difficult to find good employees.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   It's difficult.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.460]   It's risky and it's difficult.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.540]   Now when a company has an employee, they're dealing with a known quantity, a known entity.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.760]   They can understand who this person is.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.000]   They know how you work.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.620]   They know what you're capable of and what you're not capable of.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.280]   They understand who you are.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   They know if you get along.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680]   They know if you have personal problems.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.140]   They know if you don't have personal problems.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.080]   They know who you are.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.480]   So in that situation, if you are an asset to the company, if you are a good fit for
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.280]   the company, if all of those things are true, that you're productive, that you're a hard
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.680]   worker, etc., it is very much within the company's best interest to keep you.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.280]   And a slight marginal change in your salary going from $20 an hour to $23 an hour or going
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.200]   from $92,000 per year to $107,000 per year.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.760]   In the grand scheme of things, that's a very small cost for the company compared to the
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.700]   cost of replacing you.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.120]   And this is why employees who are high-performing employees, who are valuable assets to the
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.640]   company, in many cases have the upper hand.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.240]   Now there is a reality that you have to identify the market.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.680]   You have to understand, am I easily replaced?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.880]   And this is why it's so important to have valuable, unique skills.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.600]   If your job is simply saying, "Hi, welcome to Walmart," standing at the door, there's
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.980]   a certain value to somebody who knows the Walmart culture that gets along to the manager
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.260]   of that store.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.040]   But they can fairly easily find other people who are capable and competent of saying, "Hi,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.240]   welcome to Walmart."
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.440]   On the other hand, if you have unique skills, you have unique insight, you have unique industry
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.120]   experience, you have unique relationships with the clients, a company does not want
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.280]   to lose you.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:39.160]   And they're going to be often willing to increase your salary in a commensurate way to your
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.760]   contributions.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.360]   So step one is make sure that you are developing yourself, that you're a good worker, that
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.000]   you work hard, that you're diligent, first in, last out, all of those things that we
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   all know from the simple things of keeping a desk clear and being kind and dressing well.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.560]   None of those things are out of fashion, but they need to be buttressed by being at the
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.420]   top of your heap with the technical skills and you're current on the latest trends that
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.300]   affect your industry and you're filled with creative ideas and you're good at communicating
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.480]   those ideas and selling yourself.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.860]   So do all that stuff.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:17.600]   And then as you're doing that, make it a regular habit to continually ask for more compensation.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.480]   And if somebody is productive, that question, that request, the worst that can happen is
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   no.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.360]   I mean, I can't imagine a situation in which a valuable, useful employee gets in any worse
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.280]   situation because they ask for more money.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.480]   There's just no downside to asking for more money.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.600]   Now maybe if someone's just a total loser and a jerk, then I don't know, maybe there's
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.280]   some terrible boss out there, the guy comes and says, "Hey, give me more money."
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.880]   And he says, "No, I ain't giving you more money."
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.840]   And what's more, you're fired.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   But if you're a good employee, there's no downside.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.840]   The only thing that the person can say is no.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.440]   And the nice thing is this, even if they say no or even if they say no for now, by asking
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.520]   for more money, you are affecting your reputation in the eyes of your boss.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.560]   You're telling your boss, "This guy is not someone to be complacent.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.160]   This guy is looking for more money."
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.840]   And your boss will think, "Maybe I should pay him more money."
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.920]   And sometimes they'll come a week later and say, "You know what?
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   I'll pay you more money.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.040]   You asked a week ago.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.520]   I didn't realize that I was underpaying you, but I realize now that I am underpaying you
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.280]   and I'm going to pay you more money."
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.080]   Sometimes you'll ask again six months later and they say, "Yes, I'll pay you more money,"
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.280]   because they were primed for it because you asked them six months before.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.200]   Sometimes it'll just make them realize, "You know what?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.160]   This guy is going someplace."
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.920]   Because if you're doing all those things at your job, if you're genuinely productive,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.360]   if you're genuinely leading your industry, if you're genuinely developing yourself and
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.120]   contributing and looking to increase your contribution, you are a valuable commodity
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.840]   in the marketplace.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.920]   And your boss is going to know, "Hey, this guy is aggressive enough to continually and
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.720]   regularly ask me for a higher income."
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.800]   That probably also means that he's aggressive enough to be looking around the industry.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.580]   He's aggressive enough to be looking for other opportunities.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.840]   So I'd better make sure that I'm paying him what he's worth or that I'm somehow helping
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   him with a total compensation package where the total benefits are going to be his best
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.600]   offer because your employer is competing against every other employer around you and they know
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   that.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.100]   And so it's very much within their interest, if they can, to make marginal increases in
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.000]   your pay to make sure, "Yeah, I'll give you a little bit."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And even if it's a small raise, those little raises add up significantly.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.560]   And so very, very important that you continue to do this, especially—well, I was going
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.800]   to say especially in your early career.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.720]   It's true because the compounding power of those little jumps and then big jumps in the
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.080]   early part of your career make a big, big difference over the long term.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.440]   So I wanted just to take a minute to talk about it from your employer's position that
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.560]   you have to understand that if you're a good and valuable employee, then it's within their
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   interest almost every time to increase your pay as much as they can.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.320]   There may be situations where they just can't justify it.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.920]   They can't justify it to their board of directors.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.520]   They can't justify it to their bank account, in which case then you can ask for something
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   else.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.160]   You can say, "Hey, could you give me this other thing?
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.320]   You can't increase my salary, but could you allow me this other thing that I'm looking
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   for?"
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   And a lot of times they can do that as well.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.800]   So there's no downside.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.240]   If you're a good employee, there's no downside to doing what you've done and there's a lot
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.760]   of upside given that you just got a pay raise.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   So congratulations.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   Go ahead with your question, Hap.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760]   Hap Lebowitz Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   Thank you so much for saying that.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   I wonder if it's, how do you rewind when it's live?
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.760]   I want to listen to that again.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   Paul Abrams It'll be, the show will be published about
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.760]   an hour after we record, so just check your podcast feed and you'll be able to hear it.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   Hap Lebowitz Cool.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Okay.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   I'm going to be famous.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   This is great.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   My real question, so I'm not super familiar with this and I'm sure you're probably familiar
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:09.000]   with California, but just whatever you can riff on from what you know, an investment
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.440]   property versus a secondary residence or vacation home.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   My wife and I are highly considering/probably either way moving forward with taking a small,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.680]   small cabin off the hands of people we're connected to.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.320]   They used it as a vacation home, family stuff, but it kind of bled over into letting friends
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:39.200]   use it and that ended up for them setting up a website, having a reservation kind of
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.480]   system and they were connected in the church, were connected to the same church.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:51.080]   We're interested in having other people use it and using it as a ministry opportunity
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.040]   and just something that everyone can enjoy alongside us.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:02.320]   But, and we're also interested in having that make sense for everyone considering we'll
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.120]   have to do a bit more management and go clean it and stuff like that.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:13.960]   But I've been warned about the trouble you can get into if somebody mistakenly thinks
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   that your vacation home is actually functioning as an investment property or a short term
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.120]   rental type thing.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   So I'm just curious on your, if you have any experience with that or if you can maybe
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.600]   elaborate on some of the guidelines to make sure that we're just using it in the correct
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240]   way and following all the rules.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.920]   Will your, will, so let's assume that you used it as you imagined using it.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.720]   Will the financial income be significant?
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   What would you guess?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.080]   How much would you guess it would actually be?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   So we actually talked to the owners about this and they weren't really trying, right,
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.040]   from a business perspective or from a management, they didn't market it, they didn't whatever,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.680]   but they just kind of took word of mouth referrals and they didn't put it on Airbnb or anything.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   Nothing like that.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.360]   They only rented it to people they knew really well or had recommendations from people they
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   knew really well.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.480]   And they, it ended up, they said on average about 80 nights a year.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.280]   So it's really not a lot.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.560]   And I think on average that would end up covering like their mortgage.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.400]   They encouraged us that we could be much more aggressive, double the price, you know, hype
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.600]   it up a little bit more and we could probably get so much more out of it.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.360]   But that's the point at which I'm like, well, I don't want to, if that's not what we're
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.720]   supposed to be doing with it.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:47.920]   But I imagine there's not even a really a goal to get more than, you know, half or a
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.680]   little more of the mortgage paid for each month at most.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.640]   Well, from a financial perspective, it is, there's no question that from a financial
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.820]   perspective it's in your interest to use it as an investment property.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.240]   If it's desirable property, if you could make money on it and if that would fit your lifestyle,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.960]   then there's no question that it's better just to use it from an investment property.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.400]   I can't think of any argument as to why you wouldn't except for the hassle of managing
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.640]   it, the hassle of having someone clean it, the hassle of negotiating, going back and
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.760]   forth with people on Airbnb or whatever platform you wind up using.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.040]   And so if you're willing to deal with those hassles, then I think the investment property
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.600]   is certainly the way to go.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.880]   Let's talk about the difference.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:44.720]   The difference I think just simply comes down to what's deductible and what's not and also
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.920]   possibly when you go to sell a property.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:53.200]   So if you have a second home, that you use a second home, number one, there are some
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.760]   rules on it that you need to live in the house for part of the year and that you can't rent
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   it out.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.240]   I think it's more than 180 days a year.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.200]   You can't rent it out more than 180 days a year.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:12.480]   And so if that's the case though, then you will be able to, you'll qualify.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   You can deduct your mortgage, you can deduct your property taxes, but you're not going
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.800]   to be able to deduct a lot of your expenses if it's just simply a second home.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:29.400]   Now one nice thing is that there is a de minimis limit that is available on any property that
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.600]   you own where if you rent the property out for 14 days or fewer in the year, then you
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.880]   can take that income.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.120]   It's not taxable income.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.520]   It's totally tax-free income.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.360]   You're not going to take any deductions associated with the income, but it's totally tax-free.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.680]   And so this is always a nice wrinkle.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.880]   If somebody lives in a very desirable place, maybe you live in a place where the masters
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.360]   come through and for two weeks you can rent out your house and you can rent it out for
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:03.440]   $8,000 a week and rent out your nice big fancy house for $16,000 when the masters is in town
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.880]   or some local event, maybe the Kentucky Derby or that kind of thing.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.800]   So if you have, if there's some kind of seasonal scenario, any homeowner can rent their house
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.560]   out privately for 14 days or fewer and that's tax-free income.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.520]   And so that can be worth paying attention to.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:30.800]   However, if you're renting it out for more than 14 days, then you can't take it tax-free.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.080]   You will pay taxes on it, but you can apply some of the expenses to the income, I think,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:45.720]   ask an accountant, but I think based upon your occupancy versus the occupancy of a renter.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.000]   Now when you go to sell a second home that you haven't lived in as your primary residence,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.160]   you don't get the $500,000 Section 121 exclusion, the tax-free sale on your profit.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.540]   And so that's one downside.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.480]   For an investment property, you basically, the benefit of an investment property, of
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.160]   identifying it as an investment property, is that all of your expenses that are associated
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.340]   with that are now applicable to your, are deductible against it.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:24.040]   So all of your expenses would be deductible comprehensively with the exception of excluding
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.960]   whatever your personal expenses were in the property, whatever was not actually part of
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   the real estate expenses.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.240]   But I think that there'd be a lot more benefit for you of saying, "This is an investment
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.480]   property, marketing it actively, using it as an investment property.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.120]   Yes, you can still stay in it on occasion, and you'll need to not deduct the expenses
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.780]   that you have associated with staying with it, but even expenses to go and work on the
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.000]   property and check on it, things like that."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.040]   Now your mileage becomes deductible of driving out to the lake to check on the cabin and
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.120]   make sure that everything is okay.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.840]   So it's just, I think, from a tax perspective, I don't see any question why having it as
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.360]   an investment property wouldn't be a superior solution for you.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.140]   Remember that you could always, if it ever worked out in your lifestyle, you could move
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.800]   into the property at some point in time, and in moving into it, you could live in it for
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.600]   a couple of years and then always have the tax-free gain after you've lived in it for
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.160]   two years.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.280]   But I don't know of any argument as to why you wouldn't just say it as an investment
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   property if you're willing to do the work.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   And I would say that one other thing, one other benefit of doing that, sometimes when
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.720]   you have a second home and you use that second home charitably and you say, "Hey, stay at
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   my second home," that's a tremendous blessing, right?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.600]   And I think that's a nice thing to be able to do.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.280]   Many people have blessed me in that way and said, "Hey, go and stay at my lake house or
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.120]   go and stay at our mountain cabin."
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.280]   It's just such a blessing because it opens up experiences for people that they wouldn't
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.880]   be able to afford.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.840]   But sometimes those things are not as appreciated as if people know the actual benefit of it.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.160]   So from that perspective, I don't see any downside to the fact that you rent this thing
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.400]   out on Airbnb for 200 bucks a night and you tell your best friend, "Listen, why don't
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.120]   you guys go take a week at the cabin?"
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.200]   They know that's a genuinely valuable gift and it's more clear than if you didn't do
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   that.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.080]   So I don't know, maybe there's downside to that, but I don't see any reason why you wouldn't
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.280]   just say this is an investment property and use it as such.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:35.600]   Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't either.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:44.880]   I'm curious, if I can ask for your patience, what happens if we change our mindset?
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.320]   Say we particularly like with our mortgage or the implications with that if we get a
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.360]   certain rate on it or whatever, but then we change our mind about its use.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.320]   Do you know, how does that work?
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.760]   Yeah, there's not really any implications there other than what's specified in the mortgage
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.040]   contract.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:09.560]   So if I buy a house today and my plan today is to occupy that house as an owner-occupant,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.960]   this is going to be where I'm going to live.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.320]   I buy the house today and then tomorrow I get a job offer in the next state over and
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.560]   I move for that job offer because it just fell out of the blue and I move for that job
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   offer.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.360]   So there's no real reason why I can't just say, "Okay, I'm going to put this property
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.680]   in to my, I'm going to keep this property as an investment rental."
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.640]   The one thing you need to be careful of is if there are any requirements in the mortgage
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.920]   contract.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.560]   And so, for example, it's not uncommon that a personal mortgage contract might require
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.040]   residency by the borrower for one year, personal residency by the borrower for one year's time.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:54.720]   And so those clauses, they matter, but there's also probably some leeway in terms of what
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.020]   does that actually mean?
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.720]   What does residency mean?
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.360]   And so if you are just going to apply for a residential mortgage for the property, what
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.320]   does it mean that I live in the property?
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.700]   In some cases there is a clear definition.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:15.120]   If the contract states you must physically reside in this property for 181 days a year,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.300]   okay, well that would be clear.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.840]   But in my knowledge, in my understanding, that would be uncommon.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   And so I wouldn't have any problem saying I have a second home up by the lake and we
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.880]   go out there on weekends and on vacations and I spend a total of six weeks there.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   I live there, right?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   That's my second home.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.600]   I'm not trying to make them think it's my only home.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.240]   It's just that's my second home.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.200]   And so some of these terms are a little bit imprecise.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.680]   And the basic idea is that the mortgage company doesn't want their mortgages being used by
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.160]   a professional real estate investor.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.240]   They want somebody who's going to occupy it.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.160]   So an Airbnb situation I don't think would break that contract, but you'll just need
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.220]   to read the actual numbers and find out.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.380]   So there's no reason why you can't go back and forth in these.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.680]   And this would be a simple example or another example as to even how, since we're talking
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:10.000]   about tax planning, in the long run this is a useful scenario as to how you can actually
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.660]   gain with your properties over time.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.360]   So you might have a personal residence that you live in today.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.060]   And so let's just make a hypothetical scenario.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.100]   Let's pretend that you're very location agnostic, that your wife is cool with moving every few
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.560]   years and you want to build a real estate portfolio.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.140]   You can buy a single family house today.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.260]   You can qualify for it with a personal mortgage.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.180]   And it's just the mortgage is underwritten based upon your income and based upon the
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.180]   details of the house.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.500]   It's very, very, very simple.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.100]   Assuming that that mortgage requires residency for one year, you live in that house for one
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.620]   year.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.980]   And then one year later you go ahead and you rent out that house, you find some renters
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.500]   and you find another house and you buy.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.980]   And then a year later you do it again.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.060]   Then a year later you do it again.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.140]   Then you do it again.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.140]   This is called the nomad real estate investing strategy.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.260]   The idea that you just qualify for these houses based upon personal mortgages.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.780]   And so now fast forward.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:12.220]   Let's say you do this over the course of 10 years and you now own 10 rental houses.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.380]   So the house was a personal residence, then it's a rental.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.260]   Well now you can go back and let's say you want to sell and maybe your first house that
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.140]   you bought has doubled in price.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.340]   So now you move from the 10th house back into the first house and you live in it for two
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.460]   years.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.260]   Then at that point in time you go ahead and you sell that first house for a very large
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:38.020]   gain but now you qualified for the $500,000 exclusion for a married couple selling a house
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.020]   that's a personal residence.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.680]   So you can take $500,000 of gain.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.820]   Then you can move into the next one, live there for two years, maybe it's sold and you
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.100]   can take $500,000 of gain.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:51.020]   And so you can continually increase your basis and you can do that every two years and take
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.540]   that tax-free gain.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.900]   In the meantime you can still do 1031 exchanges on your other properties.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.220]   So if you've got gain but you want to swap one property out, you can sell that property.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.380]   Do a 1031 exchange of the gain into another property.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:10.620]   And so for somebody who actually was that flexible in their lifestyle, which I've never
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.620]   met somebody that was that flexible.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.460]   My wife is pretty flexible but I don't think she would be willing to do that.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.180]   But for somebody who's actually that flexible in their lifestyle, willing to move so frequently,
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.940]   you can do this by going back and forth between investment property and personal residence.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.480]   You can do this in a very, very tax-efficient way and it's all legal.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.220]   So keep that in the back of your mind.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   Cool.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.020]   Last question for you really fast.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:46.940]   I guess it was the guy I'm talking to on the mortgage side who had encouraged me to treat
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.100]   it as a secondary residence.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:55.260]   For some reason he had kind of encouraged me against treating it like an investment
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.260]   property.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.740]   It's like, "Oh, you don't want it to be this way."
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.460]   I'm sure maybe it's just him trying to get me a better rate on the mortgage or whatever.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.100]   But it kind of sounds like my next step is to just push back against that and ask him
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.500]   exactly why he thinks that.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.000]   Is there a way for me to get exact clarity?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.140]   And then of course read the fine print of whatever contract I signed to know exactly
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.580]   the specific difference or why do you think that might be?
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.580]   I don't know.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.580]   I guess I'm confused at this point.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.580]   Yeah, I'm confused at these words.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.580]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.580]   So here's the thing, okay?
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.580]   Let's keep it simple.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.420]   Because I think what you're getting drowned in is you're looking for a precise definition
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.560]   to terms that don't have a precise definition.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.060]   What is the difference between a second home that you go and spend a month at during your
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.600]   summer vacation and an investment property that you go and spend a month at during your
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   summer vacation?
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   What's the difference?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   I don't know.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   I don't know.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.300]   Yeah, it's just, the point is there's not really any difference in the way that I specified.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   It's just a matter of nomenclature.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.300]   Right.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   Right?
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   It's just a word.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.700]   And so the term second home versus the term investment property is going to have a meaning
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.380]   to the mortgage broker.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.060]   They're going to say, "Oh, if you are trying to get this as an investment property, then
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.500]   it's going to go with this kind of mortgage.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.380]   If you're trying to get it as a second home, then it's going to go with this kind of mortgage."
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.660]   Those terms have meaning to a mortgage broker, but that's not related specifically, unless
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:32.260]   their contract actually says it is, it's not related specifically to what the IRS says.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.580]   Now, the term second home versus investment property, those terms do have meaning to the
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.220]   IRS, but I went over those words.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:44.260]   It has to do with how much is it used, et cetera, and how you're approaching it.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.180]   They do have meaning to the IRS, but the IRS and your mortgage broker are not connected.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.580]   And so that's where all of these terms are a little bit fuzzy.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:28:00.740]   And there's in some cases an intentional ambiguity, and in some cases there just is ambiguity.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.340]   Where do I live?
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.580]   That's a hard question to answer sometimes.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.140]   Does that come down to where I own a home?
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.740]   Well, what if I don't own a home?
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.500]   Where do I live if I travel a lot?
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.380]   I use this stuff with my own lifestyle, which is simply, where do I live?
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:21.100]   Well, I live in multiple places, but depending on the context, I say this is where I live
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.540]   for certain things.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.020]   And so when someone says, "Where do you live?"
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:30.140]   I say this answer or that answer, because the idea of where do you live, we think we
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.140]   understand that.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.620]   And in an older context where you have one house and you work on your farm around your
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.460]   house, it's a very clear concept.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.260]   But it's not such a clear concept for those of us who have different lifestyles.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:47.980]   And so I would say that you just ask the mortgage broker and say, "What is the difference between
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.380]   the second home and the investment property?"
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.820]   And whatever is advantageous to you, ask them, "Okay, if I have the mortgage, what is the
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.580]   contract going to say?"
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.220]   Read what the contract is going to say and say, "Can I live with this?"
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:06.060]   If you can live with the restrictions of whatever the contract says for the mortgage company,
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.780]   then get the mortgage that's most favorable to you.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:15.980]   The IRS and how you classify a home with the IRS is almost certainly completely different
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.340]   from the mortgage company.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.860]   It would be—now, the only place it would enter in—we're going so deep here—but
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.780]   the only place it would enter in is let's say that you committed fraud and the mortgage
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:33.060]   company said, "We'll give you a mortgage as a second home and we'll give you this rate
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.020]   and we'll give you a mortgage as an investment property, we'll give you this rate, and you
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.740]   choose the second home because it gives you a better rate."
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.060]   And you commit fraud.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.740]   You misrepresent something to the mortgage company.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.260]   You say, "Yes, I'm going to do this."
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.180]   And so now, through some series of circumstances, which are extremely unlikely because as long
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.820]   as you pay the mortgage, most mortgage companies just want to get paid, but you default on
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.820]   your mortgage and now the mortgage company sues you.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.820]   Well, in theory, they could say, "We're going to subpoena your tax returns and look, you
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.060]   represented to the IRS that this was an investment property and look, you were recorded on a
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:09.100]   podcast to Joshua Sheets saying that this might be an investment property and then after
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.620]   the podcast, you sent your best friend an email that we're able to find that said that
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.660]   I'm getting an investment property, so you committed fraud, so therefore, you know, we
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.660]   got this."
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:25.100]   That's how this stuff comes in is that in theory, eventually, maybe down the road, somebody
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.740]   could figure out how you classified it, but in practice, have you ever had a mortgage
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:36.180]   company request your tax returns to see what your personal house was and where your physical
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.340]   presence was?
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.700]   Has your personal mortgage company ever asked you how many nights of the last 365 did you
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.500]   sleep in this particular house that we have a mortgage on?
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:51.020]   That's not – these are imprecise words and you just need to read what the contract says.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   That's what matters.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.300]   As long as you can abide by what the contract says, then go with whichever one gives you
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   the better deal.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.700]   Okay, yeah, that gives me a super clear path forward.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.700]   Thank you so much, Joshua.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   I really appreciate it.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   Cool.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   My pleasure.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.020]   All right, we go on to looks like Dan in Missouri.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.180]   Dan, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.180]   Yes.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.180]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:19.780]   I have a – it's kind of a philosophical question on saving versus giving and the way
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.220]   I think through that in my personal finances.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:31.400]   So my main problem with the general idea of financial independence for retirees early
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:38.020]   is that we call for the spending function versus saving and that not a lot of products
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.020]   are given.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:47.900]   And as a Christian, as a – living in a Western country with a lot of money, you know, I'm
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:53.420]   rich and I'm first Timothy 6 says, "I'm too good, too rich, and good work, generous,
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.500]   and ready to share," it's a big part of my lifestyle.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   And so how I solve for both putting a high importance on saving and a high importance
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.300]   on giving, which are opposed to each other, the more I give now, the less I save for later.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:17.380]   How do you think through that personally and any advice you have for the way I can do that?
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.300]   Can you ask me an easy question, please?
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:26.660]   I wasn't – I don't know if I can – this one's a tough one.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.540]   It's certainly a very real tension.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.860]   Certainly a very real tension because who was it?
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:39.580]   There was a well-known preacher who if we went and looked for, he was well-known for
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.580]   saying make all you can, give all you can, save all you can, something like that.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.500]   And when we give in, when you touch the philosophy of some of these things, it's really difficult
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:57.820]   because there's a wide range of subjective experience to this.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:03.780]   And you get into a point – we get into some pretty thorny areas of theology, get into
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:09.940]   some pretty thorny areas of hermeneutics, you know, philosophy of interpretation, of
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.180]   epistemology.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.660]   The question is very, very, very thorny.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.940]   And I'll tell you – I don't want to bury the lead with my answer.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   My answer is it's a distinctly personal decision that each person will have to make
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.580]   in faith before God.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:37.260]   And I'll tell you how I get there in my own opinion as we talk about it.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.580]   So the first thing with regard to saving.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:46.700]   Let's start with saving.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:53.980]   Saving is a thorny and difficult topic to work through biblically depending on your
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:01.540]   particular tradition, your particular interpretive lens that you put on scripture.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:08.220]   For example, I have a friend of mine who years ago gave me a book, and the book was basically
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   a very literalist, fundamentalist interpretation of Christ's command of "Don't lay up
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.460]   for yourselves treasures on earth."
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.860]   And it's "Don't lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy,
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.380]   and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.900]   where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves cannot break in and steal, for where
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.700]   your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:42.060]   And his conviction was that command is a proscription, a forbidding of laying up for
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.300]   yourselves treasures on earth.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.660]   And so he would very actively seek to not lay up treasures on earth.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:55.700]   So for him, he felt that saving was something that he couldn't do in faith at all.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.900]   No significant form of saving.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.400]   And there are other very important commands of Christ that would lead one to believe the
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   same thing.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.940]   Jesus said, "Take no thought for tomorrow."
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.020]   Take no thought for tomorrow, what you will eat, what you will drink, or what you will
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.780]   wear for tomorrow, and it will take care of itself.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:21.060]   And so when you look at things through that lens, it makes all the sense in the world
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.020]   that he would choose not to save.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:31.100]   On the other hand, there are different passages in the Bible that would seem to very strongly
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.300]   encourage saving and forethought.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.740]   We could go to the Psalms or the Proverbs, "A prudent man foresees the danger and
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.740]   hides himself."
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.460]   You could see all kinds of biblical Proverbs.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.780]   And so you have to look at it and say, "What lens do I look at these things through?"
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.540]   And so do I look at things through a red letter as primary?
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:57.180]   Did Jesus come in to institute a radically new form of living?
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.980]   And so when Jesus said, "Take no thought for tomorrow," he was giving a command that
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:07.380]   annulled all of the instructions from the book of Proverbs?
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.220]   That's I think a legitimate argument associated with that.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.740]   But it's less common, but that's a legitimate argument.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:22.540]   And so some people would take that perspective with regard to saving.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.420]   So there are those who say, "I'm not going to save anything."
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:33.060]   Now my personal trouble has often been with those who take that position has often been,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.360]   "Well, what do you do with the money instead?"
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:44.860]   So I have known people who are so abundant in their giving, they're very, very cautious
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.060]   with their expenses, and they're very abundant in their giving.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.380]   And I would never point a finger...
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.540]   First, I don't like to point fingers at anybody, but I would never point a finger at that man
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.180]   and say, "Oh, you're wrong.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.180]   You're earning $100,000 a year.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.460]   You're living on $25,000 a year, and you're giving $75,000 a year away, and so you're
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.460]   wrong."
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.880]   I wouldn't say that.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.900]   On the other hand, where I've often been troubled is I have known people who, in my opinion,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.540]   made plenty of money that they could save, but they didn't...
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.260]   And they gave money, right?
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.260]   No man answers to me.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.800]   I'm not to judge anybody of how much they give, but I had the impression or the sense
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.780]   or the clear knowledge that they gave a little bit of money away to others, but mostly what
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:35.320]   they did was they just spent their money and wasted it, and they lived not frugally.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.300]   They didn't accumulate anything.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:42.100]   And then they justified it after the fact with this basic idea of, "Well, I'm spiritual
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.300]   because the Bible says, 'Don't lay out for yourself treasures on earth.'"
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.980]   And I look at that and I think, "Is that the mark of a spiritual man?"
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.460]   And for me, that's always been something very distasteful.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.460]   I've never wanted...
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.220]   I've never aspired to be like that person.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.380]   And when we look on a global basis, this is what's so difficult, because every single
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.380]   one of us is rich.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.700]   Every single one of us is rich.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.940]   And when you say to somebody, for example, if you're preaching and you preach from...
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.540]   I think it was the verse I quoted about Jesus, Matthew 23, I think it is, where he said,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.900]   "Take no thought for tomorrow."
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.900]   Sorry.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.260]   "Don't lay out for yourselves treasures on earth."
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:30.460]   That verse preaches very differently in a suburban, middle-class, suburban, white-steepled
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:37.500]   Baptist church than it does in a little hut in rural Nicaragua.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:43.100]   It just preaches radically differently depending on who you're talking to.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.220]   And it's a verse of tremendous comfort to the poor, to the slave.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.620]   It's a verse of tremendous healing to there, and it can be a verse of tremendous judgment
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:58.820]   to the rich, suburban, white-steepled Baptist church.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.860]   And so I think that there's a real...
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.620]   We've got to face these things head on and not run from it and realize that the verse
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.580]   is there, but then understand what's the meaning of it.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.900]   Now, that's a little bit on saving.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.760]   So some people believe that I shouldn't save.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.820]   Some people believe that I should save everything.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:31.140]   And I think that here, once again, it's very easy to get into some extreme positions where
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.380]   you start to say, "That doesn't give me the flavor of Christ."
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:43.740]   I'm generally unimpressed by people who can't balance their finances enough to take care
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.180]   of the things of life.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:50.740]   You've probably known people who, they don't save anything, and everything is a matter
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.180]   of an emergency.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.740]   They have a flat tire on the car and it's an emergency.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.180]   And they just go from emergency to emergency to emergency.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.300]   And then on the other hand, though, you know people who are genuine misers, who they're
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.780]   so fixated on the money, they're so fixated on selling everything, that in my opinion,
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.340]   they go too far.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.460]   And the money has a...
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:21.740]   Again, I prefer not to be any man's judge on things like this that are intensely personal
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.260]   or I don't have the data.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.900]   But you observe people and you say, "Money has got that guy's heart."
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.940]   He's captured by the prospect of having money.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.260]   And if Jesus said to him, "Go and sell all that you have and give to the poor and come
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.860]   and follow me," he would go away sorrowful.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.860]   You can just see it.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.620]   It's obvious that the money has them.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.660]   And I don't find that to be a flavor of Christ.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.860]   I don't find that to be something that I encourage either.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.900]   So that's on saving.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.620]   What about giving?
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.700]   On giving, there are different perspectives.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:00.260]   I think that I've never known somebody who would say that I shouldn't give.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   And so that would be, I guess, maybe someone's out there, "I just, I'm not going to give."
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.780]   But I've never met a Christian or anybody who would profess the name of Christ in any
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.740]   way who wouldn't say that giving is a virtue, that generosity is a virtue.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.900]   But now we go to, to whom do I give and how do I give?
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.260]   And so the first thing would be, well, do I give to my local church?
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.820]   And then we immediately start to discuss the tithe.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:32.460]   The tithe is, I think, a more complex issue than is often given credit.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:42.420]   On the one hand, in the Mosaic law, the tithe was clearly required of the children of Israel.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.900]   And so if we go back and we look at the tithe, we can see that it was required that the children
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:56.580]   of Israel set aside and give to God 10% of their increase.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.120]   Now most of that was not wages.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.380]   Most of that was not money.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.380]   Most of it was agricultural goods.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.620]   Most of it was wheat or oil or flocks, right?
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.180]   You know, a sheep or a goat, et cetera.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.300]   And the function of it was crystal clear in scripture.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.540]   The function of it was very, very clear.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:22.740]   And it was to support the children of Levi, the tribe of Levi, who was the priestly tribe.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.320]   And so you had 11 tribes of Israel that were divided.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.500]   Those 11 tribes of Israel were granted land that they could live on, that they could use
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.420]   productively, but the tribe of Levi was set apart to the service of God.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.700]   And so those priests had to be supported by the people.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.340]   They were doing God's work.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.060]   They were working in the temple.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.340]   They were making sacrifices and offerings to God.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.920]   They were attending to the temple and all of its associated labors.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.100]   And so they needed to be supported by the people so that they would have something to
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.160]   eat.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.660]   And so you can very clearly see the function and the system of the tithe.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.140]   Now go over to the New Testament.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.320]   And the question is, does that translate over to the New Testament?
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.900]   I would say that in much of the modern world, including Protestantism, Catholicism, and
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:16.100]   Orthodoxy, I would say that the majority teaching is that yes, it does.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:22.820]   But here we run into a split, a split of a doctrinal split, and it has to do with a view
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:29.380]   of the law, a law versus grace, which is a tremendous schism across Christianity with
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.860]   the schism of, are we under law?
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.660]   And if so, what law is that versus are we under grace?
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.740]   And if so, what is that grace?
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.940]   Now the common, what I would say the most common thing is, at least across Protestantism,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.780]   would be that we are under grace, right?
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:52.140]   We're saved by grace, only grace, grace alone.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.900]   The common way to say it would be grace alone that saves, but it comes with other works,
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.900]   right?
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.080]   There are things that you do out of that place of grace.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.900]   And so most Protestant churches would not preach that you have to tithe in order to
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.180]   be accepted by God.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.140]   They would teach that you're accepted by God, and so because of that, you should want to
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.440]   tithe.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.140]   But here we once again get into this difficult thing.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:23.020]   So there are significant schisms across Protestant Christianity related to what law are you under,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   right?
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.500]   Are you under, there's the classic thing from the 1970s, no law but Christ, right?
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.820]   And many, many Christians and many Christian denominations have a distinctly antinomian
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:40.100]   flavor, this distinct sense that if you place any burden on me, that you are going beyond
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.920]   what Christ has called you to do.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.740]   And so many pastors wished that their churches would tithe, they wish that their congregants
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:53.540]   would tithe, but they shy away from preaching very vigorously about the tithe due to this
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:59.980]   antinomian flavor that runs through their theology.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   There are many people, there are, so that's not across the board.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:09.420]   So then of course there are many denominations who believe very clearly that tithing, 10%
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:14.660]   of your increase, 10% of your wages or your profits towards your local church is an exact
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:22.500]   and obvious and perfect thing to do and that you should do it and that the church is the
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.500]   new Israel, right?
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.980]   There's a theological, and this is where the break is so difficult.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.100]   There are some Christian denominations that believe that the church is the new Israel,
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.660]   that when Christ died on the cross and when the veil in the temple was rent from top to
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:44.500]   bottom, that that was the clear sign of a break of God's working with Israel as his
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.980]   special people.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:54.380]   And so in that act, God clearly said, "Israel has broken my covenant.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:58.220]   Israel has broken my covenant and as such, I'm done with her.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:03.000]   And theologically, I'm divorcing Israel and I'm marrying the church."
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.960]   And that God's final judgment on Israel came in the year 8070 when the Jewish temple was
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.800]   destroyed, when the Romans destroyed Israel and the people were scattered, that that was
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.200]   God's final judgment on Israel.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.940]   And so these theological traditions believe that God is not working with Israel.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.600]   For example, the modern nation state of Israel has no theological significance whatsoever
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:31.680]   to God, that it's just simply a nation state just like any other nation state, that the
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.200]   people of Israel are no more theologically significant to God than the people of Bahrain
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.920]   or Jordan or Oman or the United States or Russia, that it's just simply a nation like
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.200]   any other.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:50.280]   Now that's very common in many parts of the world and in many theological traditions.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.480]   That's less publicly common in the United States.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:00.440]   In the United States, there's much more of a theological belief that the nation of Israel
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:07.240]   has a continuing significance to God, that the nation of Israel, that when the nation
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.960]   of Israel was formed after World War II, it was in 1948 I think, when the nation of Israel
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:19.320]   was formed, that that was a sign of God's fulfilling his covenant mandate with Abraham,
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.320]   Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give them this land to their ancestors.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.280]   And as the Jews were gathered together from all the scattered lands, that that was a very
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.880]   significant event to God.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.680]   And so these traditions believe that the modern nation of Israel is a nation to whom God still
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.520]   has – that there's a modern nation that continues as God's chosen people.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.080]   Now this is a little bit tricky to work through because there's some significant meanings
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.640]   to either saying the modern nation of Israel doesn't have significance to God or it does.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.440]   And so if it does, it opens up kind of this two-system thing, which is very difficult
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   for Christians to answer.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.800]   Well, if Jews are God's special people, then do they need to respond to Christ?
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.040]   Do they continue in Judaism?
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.440]   How are they saved, etc.?
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:06.920]   It gets really, really, really, really difficult as you parse your way through the issues.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   Now thankfully, most people never get into this, but theologians are trying to build
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.520]   a structured, coherent system.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.920]   You kind of take your position on these issues, and then that position largely guides what
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.200]   you're doing.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.160]   And so back to the church is the new Israel.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.800]   So if the church is the new Israel, then those traditions, those theological traditions that
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.320]   say the church is the new Israel, they have no problem saying the church is the new Israel,
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.280]   and so therefore the church is the priest – those are the priests that are functioning.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:49.440]   And so those priests need to be supported by 10% of the congregants' increases.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.240]   And so they have no problem with that being agricultural goods and agricultural societies,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.320]   but in the modern society where most of us live in a financial society, then that's
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.000]   a financial contribution.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.200]   So – and they're very strong about that.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.040]   And I think there's very good arguments, right?
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.080]   Anyway, there's very good arguments.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.840]   On the other hand, there are many people who believe that, for example, what is it, 1 Peter?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   We are a nation – ye are a royal priesthood, you are a royal priesthood, that we're a nation
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.960]   of priests.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:29.140]   And so there are many people who would say that there is no priest and layperson.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.440]   There is no longer this priestly class or priestly caste in the church, but that we're
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.120]   all involved, that we're all priests.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:44.280]   And so as such, then why should one special class of people be supported by the others
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.320]   at the risk of – why should one special class of people be supported financially just
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.160]   so that they can preach, just preach, preach, preach, preach?
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.680]   And I think that some of these arguments are very compelling.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:02.520]   For example, I think it can be easy for people when you see, "Oh, there's these pastors
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.960]   and they get paid and all they got to do is preach a sermon one or two hours a week and
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.720]   maybe pray a little bit, go to the hospital, visit with some people in their study and
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.160]   study Greek and Hebrew all day.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.160]   Isn't that easy?
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   Isn't that a nice life?"
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:22.080]   Now, of course, pastors know that things are more difficult than that, but that in that
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.200]   situation that people make a good argument.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   Why should I support this guy to be the holy guy up on there?
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.960]   We're not offering sacrifices on the altar anymore.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.920]   We're not – you're not burning incense anymore.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.000]   Apologies to my Catholic and Orthodox friends who do that.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.400]   But we're not a two-class system any longer.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.440]   And so this is where it's so confusing in Protestantism.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.560]   Again, go back to a place where there's either – it can be a Protestant tradition where
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:03.640]   there's a very clear priesthood or Catholicism, Orthodoxy, where there are priests.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.480]   And so, okay, I got to support the priest.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.480]   But in the looser realms of Protestantism, then this becomes more difficult.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:18.560]   So I've given all these perspectives, and I haven't answered the question specifically
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:26.640]   because the question is going to have an obvious answer to people based upon their tradition.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:33.260]   And it's some of those who aren't part of the more traditional hierarchical expressions
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.760]   of Christianity where it does become more difficult, which is where I would guess that
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   you're coming from.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.320]   If you were coming to me and you were in the Orthodox Church, you wouldn't have that
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.120]   question so significantly.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.880]   And so when I look at it, I'll give you my answer for it.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.680]   When I look at it, I'll tell you where my sympathies lie.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:56.560]   First of all, I am a Protestant, and so my sympathies are in that realm rather than in
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.680]   the realm of Orthodoxy or Catholicism.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:07.440]   And in addition, my sympathies are very much on the simple church model, the context that
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.480]   I have a very hard time with the idea that Christianity is something for the professional
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.760]   classes.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:22.680]   And as I see it, the institutional churches and the very hierarchical institutional churches
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:30.040]   do a whole lot less for the strength of their congregants than do simpler forms of church
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.560]   gathering.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:38.120]   And I'm intentionally foregoing lots of moderating statements just to say something clearly,
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.440]   but I'm not judging any man's heart.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.200]   I have to give a couple, but I'm not judging any man's heart, just saying that when I look
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:51.820]   at the functioning that I see in the scripture, to me, what I read in the book of Acts is
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.880]   a simpler system.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   And when you go to a simpler system, it changes some of the financial scenarios.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.560]   So for example, I have never been, with the exception of a brief time last year, I've
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   never been a part of a large institutional church that had to maintain a building.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.240]   And in that situation, if you have a church that has to maintain a building and they have
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.480]   to pay for the air conditioning bill and they have to pay for the 401k plans, etc., then
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.480]   you understand, okay, I need to support the local church.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:27.720]   And when I was briefly last year, part of a more structured, organized church prior
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:32.120]   to that getting shut down by COVID, then I supported financially because I understand
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:37.600]   that I have an obligation to help care and share the expenses of this organization.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:46.320]   However, for the last six months of COVID, I've had a church gathering in my home, which
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:51.120]   is kind of the way that I've always experienced church in a very simple way.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.280]   There's 20 to 30 people that get together every Sunday and we gather in my home.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.960]   And we have breakfast together and then we gather and we talk about scriptures and we
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:05.160]   pray and we invite people and we are functioning very much like a new fledgling church.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.400]   And it's just because everything was shut down.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.240]   And so in that situation, who do I give my tithe to, right?
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.540]   Who do I give my 10% to?
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.280]   It just becomes very strange if you are from a simpler tradition.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:23.300]   It becomes very strange to think about, if I'm preaching this Sunday, why should everyone
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.840]   give me thousands of dollars just because I preached a sermon?
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.040]   That's different.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:33.720]   But even in those simpler expressions, which is where my sympathies lie and my experience
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.800]   lies, even in those simpler expressions, even in the simple church, right?
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.100]   That would be the missiology word that would be used in a modern seminary, the simple church.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:48.000]   Even in that context, though, you cannot get away and escape from the very clear Christian
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.040]   teaching to support those, right?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.280]   The Bible says very clearly in the New Testament, not an Old Testament thing, the Bible says
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.560]   very, very clearly that you are to support those.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.120]   A worker is worthy of his wages.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.580]   Those who labor in teaching and preaching are worthy of double honor.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.640]   And so that's very clearly financial.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:13.420]   So you have very clear commandments in scripture to give, to give to support ministry, to give
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:18.240]   to support missionary work, to give to support financial relief, et cetera.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.620]   And so in that context, just because you're in the New Testament, you're not absolved
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.880]   from giving.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:31.060]   So let me give you what I have come to at this point in time as my current understanding.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:39.940]   I am nervous, although I see the benefits of preaching about a tithe, I am nervous about
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.720]   preaching that extremely strongly at this point in time.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:56.060]   It is very clearly a system that was clearly important and mandated by God prior to Christ,
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:01.140]   but it is not so clearly a system that was mandated by God after Christ.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:08.220]   I have a very hard time preaching from the New Testament on the requirement of a tithe.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.820]   And so I'm nervous about that.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.060]   So I haven't done a lot on it.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:20.300]   I haven't done shows on tithing, but I'm nervous about it theologically.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.780]   Now on a couple of these big theological issues, I've been wrestling with a lot of these for
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.820]   about the last five to 10 years, trying to understand my own thinking on it.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:33.900]   And I'm not at a place of rest in my own understanding on some of these issues, where I'm still working
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.500]   it through and trying to discern, okay, what's the right solution?
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:50.860]   But what I do look at it is I say that if BC, then it was mandated by God that all of
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.700]   the children of Israel would tithe 10% to support the work of God.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:03.060]   If that was true BC, then why should my requirement personally in AD be any less?
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:08.900]   Why should I not personally be giving more in AD?
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:15.460]   Because when you look at the preaching of Christ, what you see is that on so many issues,
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:20.000]   Christ took the standard that was given to Moses and he raised it.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.420]   So you see this most pointedly when Jesus said, "You have heard that it was said, 'An
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.860]   eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.460]   But I say to you, love your neighbor, do good to those who despise you, do good to those
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.660]   who persecute you."
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:37.500]   You have heard it said that – we're talking about divorce, right?
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.700]   The Pharisees were asking Jesus, "Can a man divorce his wife for any reason?"
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:47.020]   Jesus said, "You've heard it said that such and such, Moses commanded you to give a certificate
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.020]   of divorce.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.480]   I say to you, don't divorce."
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.760]   But I say to you, don't divorce.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.480]   And so on almost every issue where Jesus was preaching, you have heard it said, "Don't
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   commit adultery."
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.140]   But I say to you that if you look at a woman with lust in your eyes, you've already committed
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.400]   adultery with her in your heart, that things were raised.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:10.680]   And so the basic structure that you see AD, Anno Domini, after Christ, you see that almost
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.480]   all of the requirements of the old were raised.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.980]   I can't think of any requirement from the old that was not raised in the new.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:26.980]   And so given that, then I say I have no fear whatsoever about saying that any Christian
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:32.540]   should clearly be giving away at least 10% of his income.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:39.380]   Where I do question a little bit though is if that is held as a legal thing.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.940]   I have a hard time, and especially I have a big question if that all goes to support
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:44.940]   the local church.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:50.180]   So I have a very hard time in some of the circles that I travel in going to some big
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:54.700]   monster mega church in the favelas of Brazil.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:59:00.380]   And or I have a hard time going to some big monster mega church in Nigeria where the pastor
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:06.340]   rolls up in a Rolls Royce and he's got a private jet and he preaches to the people who are
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.660]   utterly destitute, "Come and give.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.740]   And if you give to God, after all, Malachi says, 'Give, test me in this, give, and will
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.380]   you not find the windows of heaven opened up and poured out upon your life?'"
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:25.740]   I find that utterly repulsive and I want nothing to be involved with that.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:30.940]   And so when you look at situations where you see somebody who is in great need, I have
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:36.320]   no problem saying to somebody who has very little, "You should be giving."
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.100]   But I want to honor the giving of time, I want to honor the giving of resources, and
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.620]   I want to honor the giving.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:46.660]   And I want that giving not to be to some big monster mega church organization, I want that
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.940]   giving to be local.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.740]   I want – I have a spirit of giving.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:54.620]   So for I've come to it, is I've come to it to say that God honors my giving and that
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:56.420]   I need to be a giver.
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:01.620]   And a minimum goal, not something that's a stretch goal, but a minimum goal or a minimum
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.660]   standard should be 10% of my income.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:10.260]   I should at least start by setting aside 10% of my income and designate that to giving.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.940]   Now if I'm involved with a local church where there are responsibilities and functions of
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.740]   that local church, so for example, maybe I'm gathering with a group of people and we have
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.020]   a building, we've chosen to build a building.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:27.420]   Frankly, I'd just as soon tear down half the buildings and put churches back in neighborhoods
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:34.500]   where they're not so subject to – where they're more useful in many situations.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.140]   But I'm not utterly opposed to buildings, just that it just doesn't strike me as particularly
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.140]   useful.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.780]   You wind up putting yourself in a difficult place when you build these big buildings.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.700]   One of my biggest issues with buildings is just that it stunts evangelism.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:52.020]   If your church has a building and you can seat 500 people, if everybody in your church
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.740]   went and invited somebody to church to the church meeting this Sunday, if you're using
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:01.940]   a Sunday meeting as a primary form of evangelism, and if half of those people came, all of a
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.780]   sudden you've got a problem.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.020]   And so buildings naturally are very, very difficult.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:12.340]   So in many contexts, especially in Western contexts, I'd much rather see churches function
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.340]   flexibly.
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:19.300]   I'd rather see people meeting in a gym where you can go from 200 to 600 and back to 300
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.820]   with minimal expenses than these big, big buildings that cost so much.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.380]   I'd rather see people meeting in homes where I can gather from 20 people to 50 people and
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.740]   it's not a big deal.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.580]   Now in other circumstances though, where homes are much smaller and it doesn't work, then
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.940]   I'm not opposed to buildings.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   I just think that buildings stunt growth and buildings have this event – again, these
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:45.860]   are my opinions – I think that buildings have this unanticipated end result of having
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:51.040]   everybody looking towards the front, which creates this priestly class that does the
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.600]   spiritual work.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:02:00.260]   And so instead of what I see in the scriptures where Paul says that ministers are given – teachers,
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:07.380]   evangelists, apostles, prophets, and pastors – that these ministers are given to the
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:13.560]   local church for the equipping of the saints for their work of ministry, then it feels
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.700]   to me like a lot of my travels, what we do is we get that wrong and we think that the
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:22.380]   preachers are given and the teachers are given for the building up of the saints, just for
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.500]   their own benefit, when in reality it's the saints who have to do the spiritual work.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:33.940]   And so, forgive me, but I see benefits to having the simpler model.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:39.620]   And so when you give, then the – so if you're part of a church where there is a – you
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.460]   have a pastor who's serving, you have a responsibility to support that pastor.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.100]   If you're part of a church that has a building, you have a responsibility to support that
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.420]   building.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.520]   If you're renting a place to meet in, you have a responsibility to meet that.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.860]   And so you need to allocate money towards that.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:58.860]   And to the extent that the church is a – that the church in whatever function it has is
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.180]   able to manage that money effectively and you're able to see an increase from it, then
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.620]   I have no problem with it.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:10.300]   But what you have to do, and this is where it gets theologically difficult for some people,
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.660]   what you have to do is if you see the church wasting its resources, then you need to withdraw
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.580]   those resources.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.420]   And that's difficult because a lot of people don't want to do that.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.500]   And so my question is, are you getting a good return on your money?
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.700]   And what I would wish to see is that many people started with the mindset that I'm
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:32.940]   going to give 10% of my money, but I would wish to see that more of us took more ownership
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.700]   of that 10% and how we did it.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.540]   It's not to say that you can always – that there's not benefits of working together.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:43.400]   I think there are benefits of working together.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.660]   If you can support a certain program or a certain thing, a certain outreach, a certain
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.860]   missionary, a certain thing that's done administratively, that can be helpful.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.060]   And so for those who see that and can work together, I think they should.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:00.400]   But what I'd like to see more people do is do more personal giving, because in personal
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.000]   giving you have the opportunity and the ability to expect requirements, to expect a gain.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.820]   And I believe that if we ask God for those opportunities and those circumstances, that
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.820]   he'll give them to us.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.660]   He'll bring the people along that need help.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:19.620]   I'll just share one example.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:26.700]   For a while now, I've been supporting a lady who is in very dire financial circumstances
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.900]   right now.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:33.920]   And as such, because she's in dire financial circumstances, she was previously employed,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.220]   but a couple of years ago she started to have some health problems and she wasn't able to
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.460]   work and she's just been in complete poverty.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:48.940]   And she has older children, but her children are not caring for her.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.500]   And I don't see in the place that she's in, I don't see in the place that she's in how
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:05:00.580]   she's going to make it, especially given the scenarios that we're in with regard to the
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.900]   pandemic.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:08.500]   And so I've been supporting her for a time, and yet in my supporting her, I have the opportunity
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:21.140]   as an individual to be relatively free in the sense that I can be free in helping her
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.820]   in the way that I think is best.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:28.300]   And so in the beginning, what I started with is I chose to give her food, right?
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.180]   And basically she didn't have any money for food.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.780]   I said, "Well, I need to give her food."
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.180]   And I started to give her money, but very quickly, instead of just giving money, giving
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.860]   money, I got involved and I said, "Let's find a solution.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.020]   We have to find a solution."
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.580]   And in giving to her, I'm able to look and talk to her.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:50.100]   And it's not going through some board, through someone else, it's coming through me.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.600]   And I'm able to talk to her and I'm able to say what's going on and to counsel her and
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.340]   try to find a solution.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.300]   Now in this situation, due to the pandemic, I don't think she's going to be able to be
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.160]   employed here in a local area.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.260]   So I've helped her with some of the finances locally.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.460]   I paid off some of her debts.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.900]   I've supported her.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.860]   But more importantly is I'm trying to find a solution where she can get back on her feet.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:16.220]   And so that solution in her case, she has dual citizenship with another country where
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.380]   there's a better economy.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.780]   And so my solution for her is I'm supporting her.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.220]   I've encouraged her to move to the other place.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:27.960]   I'm paying for all of her expenses to get there, paying for her to buy her clothes and
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.480]   things that she has.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.940]   And I'm paying for expenses for her to go and get there and then supporting her for
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.220]   a short time while she gets her feet under her until she can get employed.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.900]   And so I say that simply to say that I have, as an individual, I have a tremendous degree
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:49.180]   of leeway that no government aid organization, no church aid board would ever have.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:54.100]   And I can move fast and easy and I can, in a sense that I can solve problems because
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.300]   I don't have the burden of oversight.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.740]   If I were part of a church board that was part of a charitable aid board, we would have
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:07.740]   to develop some kind of process where we knew that we were treating people properly, equally.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:12.540]   So we would have to have some kind of application process where somebody brought a paper and
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.220]   said here, here's my need and will you help me and here's my expenses, et cetera.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.220]   And those things can be good.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:20.780]   I'm all for appropriate care and managing them.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.820]   And on a small level they can work.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   But on an individual level, I have utmost flexibility with my giving.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.780]   I have the easy ability to say here's a need and I can solve this need.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:37.620]   And I can solve the need for as long as I see that solving the need is a good thing
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.880]   and I can stop solving the need when I see that it's not a good thing.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.100]   And so that's the benefit that we have as individuals.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:47.260]   So I think that where we should start with our giving is primarily individual.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.500]   We should support others, but we should start with individuals.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:57.540]   Sorry, we should support the local church, especially to the extent that the local church
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.980]   has expenses.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:02.120]   My local church at present doesn't have expenses.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.620]   And so in that situation I don't have something that I can tithe to, right?
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:10.000]   What would I be doing in that situation?
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.740]   So we should support our local church because we've given a responsibility.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.220]   We should be involved in and we should make sure that that church is accountable for how
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220]   it's done.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.340]   And we should support things in that local church, especially to the extent that they're
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.340]   fruitful.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:28.220]   So if there are certain ministries or if there are certain forms of outreach that are fruitful,
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.340]   then we should do it.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.060]   And so right now maybe running a food bank would be an incredibly fruitful thing to do
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.180]   and be very useful.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.300]   We should do that.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:40.140]   And I think that if the local church can be organized in such a way that the deacons and
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:45.720]   the responsible leaders can help the administration so we see that people are getting help that
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:52.620]   they need and not just handouts, then, you know, handouts with no responsibility attached,
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.100]   then we should continue to do that.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.220]   And that can be a fruitful form of outreach.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.780]   I think we should look in our personal life and say, "Where are there opportunities for
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.900]   us to give?" and give there.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.780]   And as we're wrestling with the question of how much we should give versus how much we
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:12.620]   should save, I see no answer and no solution other than to ask God to give us a witness
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.360]   by the Holy Spirit as to what his answer is for you or for me.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.340]   And I am entirely comfortable to leave that up to God.
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:25.780]   I'm entirely comfortable for you to come to me and say, "I believe that God is telling
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.100]   me that I should give 10% of my income away.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:35.180]   I should save 40% of my income for my future and I should spend 40... whatever.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.060]   20, 40, 40.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.980]   I can't do math.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.940]   You know, I should give 10%, I should save 50%, and I should live on 40%."
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   Okay.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:53.140]   I'm also entirely comfortable if you come to me and say, "I've prayed about it and I
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:58.020]   believe that God has shown me that what I should do is I should give 50% of my income
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.620]   away and I should live on 50%."
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.540]   And I think this has to be left at a place of personal freedom before the Lord because
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.820]   each person has different circumstances.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:12.600]   I can't go into a Christian in New York City or in London, England and say, "You're spending
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.900]   $10,000 a month?
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.380]   Are you kidding me?
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.380]   What's wrong with you?
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.620]   Don't you know that people around the world live on $2 a day?"
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.980]   I can't go into that because in New York City or in London, England, $10,000 a month may
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:32.340]   just provide a basic level of comfort for a family to be able to be held together.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:37.740]   On the other hand, it's not my place to go into anybody's life, but that would be very
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.500]   different if I were living in Biloxi, Mississippi.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.540]   And so each of us has to look and say, "What can we do?"
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.380]   And I'll give you more examples.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:50.100]   One of the things that I have realized is that I don't think it's a credit to God when
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:55.180]   people live excessively frugally because they don't know how to make money.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:11:00.020]   I don't see any way that it's honoring to God if I live like in a hovel, right?
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:06.900]   I live in a shack and I say, "Well, I'm just this pious person where I live in this dump."
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.180]   And somebody comes along and like, "Aren't you a Christian?
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.260]   Don't you serve the God who claims to have a cattle on a thousand hills and here you
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.460]   are living in a dump?"
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.660]   I think that that can poison relationships.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.980]   I think it can poison marriages.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.300]   I think it can poison relationships with children.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.100]   I think that it's very easy to go too far.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:29.740]   And so I would be very nervous about living like a miser and making my children suffer,
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.380]   my wife suffer, et cetera, just because I'm doing all this pious giving.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.420]   I'd be very nervous about that.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.220]   On the other hand, there is excess.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:42.300]   And I think that that excess has to be looked at as well.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.140]   And so I don't see a solution.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.340]   I don't see a clear biblical mandate.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.860]   I've talked about the tithe.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.580]   I think that's a good minimum, but I think that it's something that should be understood
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.460]   as a minimum.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:01.940]   But I don't think it's something—some people have this belief that says, "As long as I
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.340]   give my 10% to the local church, I can do whatever I want with the other 90%."
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.740]   I had a friend of mine who was a Jewish rabbi, and he expressed it most clearly.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.260]   We were talking about the subject from a Jewish versus Christian perspective, and he said,
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   "Listen, Joshua, you're crazy.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.660]   As long as I give my 10% to God, I'm done.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.540]   I can do whatever I want with the other 90%.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.100]   I have a hard time with that from a Christian perspective because I believe the basic Christian
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.540]   ethic is that God owns it all.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   He owns all of me.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.100]   He owns all my money, all my life, all my time, and I have to go to Him and ask Him
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.220]   in faith, 'What do you want me to do right now?'"
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.220]   And so—yeah, go ahead, please.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.020]   So that's the end of the tension that I struggle with.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:46.980]   Much like we can talk about spending and saving as not being true to your distinction, you
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.700]   know, am I saving up for a house?
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:56.340]   You know, at some level, that's consumption just a few years down the road, versus capitalizing.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:01.620]   Am I saving up to produce more in the future?
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:08.900]   And I think if I set the percentage of my income or resources that I want to give away
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:13.860]   every year, and I'm continually trying to increase that, just like I am with my savings
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:22.100]   and my savings, maybe this is a different question, but is it possible to have a portion
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:29.620]   of my savings being essentially capitalized for giving?
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:35.860]   And that's where these lines between saving and giving blur, like the blur between saving
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.860]   and spending.
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.340]   Where I have come to, and I want to hear where you've come to, and that was quite the monologue,
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.580]   but where I've come to on the subject is that yes.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.580]   So at the moment, right, what am I doing?
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.700]   I'll just tell you what am I doing personally at the moment.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:57.340]   At the moment, when I earn money, I set a certain percentage aside into a separate giving
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:03.420]   account because I don't want to be caught without some money to give.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.660]   And I find that by setting money aside into a separate giving account, I'm looking for
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.540]   opportunities to give.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.780]   I think that there's a great danger of having everything earmarked for spending or saving
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.180]   because you stop looking for money to give.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.300]   And I found years ago when I first started setting aside money into a separate account,
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.660]   you start to see it grow, and you're like, "I need to give this away."
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:27.060]   But I feel no compulsion that I have to give it away today.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.860]   I can let it grow for a while, and I'm looking for opportunities.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.460]   I'm looking for things that I can give money to, and I want those things to be productive.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:43.100]   Now, I'm also actively saving and accumulating, and along the way, what my attitude is, I
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.220]   believe that God has given me a lot, and I believe that I can use it to create more.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:52.580]   In the same way that we can't get away from what Jesus preached about, you know, "Don't
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.180]   lay out for yourselves treasures on earth," in the same way we can't get away from what
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:04.980]   Jesus preached about, "Don't take no thought for tomorrow," we also can't get away from
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:06.700]   the parables of the good steward.
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.700]   All right?
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:12.060]   Jesus very clearly, in the parables of the good steward, he very clearly taught that
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:16.460]   when the master goes away, he expects to come back and find an increase.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:21.320]   The thing that is very important to me to emphasize is that when Jesus was preaching
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.740]   that parable, the reason he used the word "talent" was because a talent was a sum of
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   money.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:31.660]   Now, in my understanding of the etymology of the word "talent," in the modern world,
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:37.700]   we use the word "talent" to refer to some kind of innate ability, innate skill that
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:43.460]   we have, some ability, some way that we're better at something than someone else.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:48.680]   We use that in the modern age that comes from this parable, largely because we've taken
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.860]   this parable to enhance and say that God wants an increase.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.400]   But in the original context, it was a form of money.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.460]   It was a sum of money.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460]   It was bucks.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   It was dollars.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   It was yen.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.460]   It was money.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.720]   And so I believe that God wants an increase on our money.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.860]   And so this is where I've come to.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:14.060]   What helped me a lot was as I walked away from most of the mainstream forms of increase
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:19.580]   of money, especially just mass market mutual funds, and when I did that, I saw much more
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:24.060]   value to my investment dollars than I ever did previously.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:29.320]   I went through a significant personal tension for a while where I had all this money in
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.740]   mutual funds, and I thought, "How on earth is this at all helpful?
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.540]   The only benefit I'm going to get from these mutual funds is that I'm going to get richer.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.780]   Okay, well, I like to get richer.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780]   That's fun.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:45.860]   But it seems to me a really, really shallow return on investment if I just get richer."
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:50.180]   And I looked at some of these companies, and I thought, "These companies, some of them
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.560]   are flat out immoral.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.140]   Many of them, how do I look Jesus in the eye and say, 'Yes, I invested your money into
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:04.540]   this company' when they're clearly engaged in things that are absolutely abhorrent to
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.060]   the gospel of Christ?
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.320]   How do I do that?"
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.220]   And so when I walked away from that, it helped.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.660]   It gained me a lot of peace, and I started to see, "Okay, I see how.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:18.060]   If I can invest my money into something where there's more benefits from it, then now I
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.140]   see how it can be helpful."
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.500]   And so I like to use as a simple example a rental house.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.580]   A rental house is a tremendous asset for an investor.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   Why?
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:28.220]   Well, a rental house needs work.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.220]   And so now, let's say I've got the guy who says, "I don't have any work."
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:35.180]   I can say, "Listen, buddy, why don't you come over and I'll pay you to paint the house?"
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.100]   And something as simple as taking money that's in an index fund and using it to buy a rental
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.820]   house allows me to create work for people.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.660]   And that work for people is something that can be useful.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.940]   So now, instead of talking to the homeless guy on the street and saying, "Here's some
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:54.500]   money," or, "Here's some food," or, "Here's a tract," and don't you know there's a homeless
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.500]   shelter, I can say, "Listen, I've got some work.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.420]   Would you like to come and work with me?"
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.020]   And many businesses go beyond that.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:06.540]   So small or privately held businesses provide a tremendous platform that which you can use
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.540]   them.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:11.780]   I've said this publicly before, but I have a client of mine who I'm deeply jealous of.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:16.580]   But this client of mine has a business in the automobile business.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:21.940]   And he has the ability to hire guys who don't have a high school degree.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:26.020]   He primarily hires men because it's heavy, hard, difficult work that most women don't
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.540]   want to do.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.060]   And so he has the ability to bring in guys that are high school dropouts and give them
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.060]   a job.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:38.380]   And he's got a hundred, a lot of these young men working for him.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.900]   And as I look at it, my heart bleeds for these guys who have no opportunities.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:46.420]   And I look at it and I say, "My client's not a Christian."
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.900]   And I'm forever telling him, I'm like, "Dude, you've got the best opportunity for evangelism
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.060]   in the world."
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.340]   And he takes it seriously.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.620]   He takes his mentoring role seriously.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.180]   And he does a good job with it.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:04.340]   But it's opened my eyes to an expression of investment that for me is very, very important.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.500]   Now, the nice side benefit of his business is that it mints money.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.120]   It's the most obscenely profitable thing I've ever come across in my life.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.900]   And yet he's got this incredible opportunity where he's got dozens and dozens and dozens
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:24.460]   of young, difficult, broken men who he can help.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.980]   And I've wanted so much to make this side project.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   I haven't done it.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:35.420]   But I wish that so many more Christians, well-heeled Christians, would stop putting their money
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.340]   into Wall Street and would start investing it locally.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:45.820]   Because I see that as ways that now you can really fulfill that dual-fold mandate.
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:50.580]   You can make a lot of money and you can do a lot of good.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:54.540]   And it's one of the things that I've been working hard in my private life to try to
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.140]   figure out the answers to.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.500]   But I think that it solves that in a lot of ways.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.460]   Because as I see it, there's no reason why you have to choose between them.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.820]   There's no reason why you have to choose between doing it.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   Even with regard to giving.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.820]   And I've got to stop.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:10.700]   But I'll just say this with regard to giving.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.220]   And I want to hear your thoughts on this.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:18.040]   But when I give money, I don't like to give money where it's not going to grow.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.500]   So I'm happy to give money.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.420]   I rejoice in giving money.
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:26.380]   And I believe that there are circumstances in which giving money where it's just gone
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.060]   is right.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.100]   You say, "Here, I'm giving to you."
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.940]   But to use the example I shared from my personal life, I told this lady that I'm supporting.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:38.740]   I told her, I said, "Listen, I'm not going to keep giving you money for a long time.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.420]   And so why am I doing all this stuff for you?
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.140]   Why am I moving you to another country?
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.120]   Why am I buying you a new wardrobe?
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.740]   Why am I helping you with settlement expenses and whatnot?
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.820]   I'm doing it so that I can stop giving you money.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.620]   Because you're not going to be a charity case.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.460]   You're not disabled.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.260]   You're perfectly fine.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.100]   I'm not going to keep giving you money for years and years and years.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.100]   And this is going to be Joshua's pet project.
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.900]   I don't believe in welfare.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:06.060]   And so I'm going to give money where there's going to be a return.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:10.100]   And in her case, I'm going to require her to return the money.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.420]   Now I might have her pay it back to me.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.140]   I might have her pay it back to someone else.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.300]   But I'm going to require a return on my money.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:20.060]   And I think that even with giving, this is the proper attitude.
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:25.820]   That when I give to something, I want to give in an area where I know it's going to grow.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:29.380]   I was involved a number of years ago with a project in Africa.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:32.740]   And we gave and we bought a farm for a guy.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:40.220]   And this is a guy who was in a situation where he had four or five children, I think.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.900]   And then he adopted 12 orphans.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:47.220]   And he had no ability whatsoever to pay.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.220]   He had nothing to do.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.700]   And so we bought a farm and we gave it to him for a farm.
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700]   Gave him a farm.
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.800]   It was a big financial gift.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.300]   But in that situation, that farm has become a tremendous center of outreach and ministry.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:06.340]   That farm has supported these at least 16, I think 20 children now, something like that,
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.240]   helped them to establish themselves.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.700]   That farm has provided.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.500]   We've invested into the farm.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.700]   That farm, for example, we dug a well.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.300]   We gave the money to dig a well on the farm.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.420]   Well, that well has kept the whole village supplied with water.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:25.980]   And the nice thing about the way that it was done is that the return on that gift has been
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.540]   huge.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:32.340]   Not in terms of money back, but in terms of a return on investment, it's been well worth
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.340]   it.
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:37.660]   The man who was the farmer is involved with a dozen or two churches.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:42.100]   I shouldn't give too many details away, but a dozen or two churches that are basically
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.820]   all flowed from the original gift of the farm.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:50.260]   And so I think that even in giving, we should be looking for a return, but that part of
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:56.300]   that return is financial, but part of it and a significant part of it is in souls.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.080]   How do you lay up treasures in heaven?
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.400]   You invest in souls.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.400]   You invest in people.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.820]   And as you invest in people, people are what's in heaven.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:08.020]   So when you're investing in people, then you're investing in heaven.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.740]   So that's how I see it.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:13.740]   I'm going to quit because that was an absurd 45 minute monologue.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.700]   Tell me your thoughts, Dan, and how you've worked through these issues.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:27.100]   Yeah, I see it as people and organizations doing good things to give money to, whether
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:35.620]   that's working with people just getting out of prison or women in crisis pregnancy or
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.780]   people working to translate the Bible into languages.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:46.300]   And there's all sorts of opportunities to support causes that you think are worthy of
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.860]   it.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:56.660]   And so I try to do that, support people and groups and organizations that I believe are
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:03.660]   genuinely needing help.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:09.380]   And I'm always cognizant of saving for myself in the future.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:15.540]   Someday I am going to have health problems and it is what we're called to take care of
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.540]   our family first.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.580]   You know, I need to take care of my parents.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:26.420]   So there are things I need to save for in the future.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:42.580]   I think it's good that it be a never ending question because if it's the difference between
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   Christianity or at least the flavor of Christianity that I identify with, one of the big differences
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:55.700]   between Christianity and many other major religions is the accountability, the sense
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700]   of accountability.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.980]   You know, I spent a lot of time thinking about and studying Islam.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:06.340]   Islam is a profoundly simple religion compared to Christianity.
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:11.700]   The requirements for a Muslim are so simple, they're so much easier to explain, it's so
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:18.660]   much easier to discuss than it is the requirements of Christianity.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:25.700]   And yet this concept of a personal God, which I believe is the cornerstone of Christianity,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.820]   is a concept that is absent in Islam.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.540]   And so to me this is one of the great things, the great tensions that should never go away,
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.540]   right?
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.020]   I'm responsible to God for how I use my time.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:43.020]   And so I need to be able to be in faith, you know, to be able to be doing what I'm doing
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   in faith.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.860]   And sometimes that means sitting at a, you know, a couple weeks ago, sitting at a five
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.340]   star resort with my children, teaching my children to swim.
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.340]   And I was there in total faith.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:54.180]   I wasn't thinking, "I should have taken this money and given it to the poor.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.060]   After all, you know, I would just be so much better if I'd taken this money to give it
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.060]   to the poor."
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:01.700]   I was sitting at a five star resort, a beautiful pool, teaching my little children how to swim.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:06.860]   And we did nothing but enjoy ourselves in what we were doing.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.300]   We ate nice food, we swam in the pool, we had a great time.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:16.500]   And I was in faith because I believe that what I'm doing in that situation is I'm fulfilling
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.300]   number one, God's taking care of me, right?
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.300]   I need a vacation.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:23.500]   A master doesn't make a steward work like a dog all the time.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.540]   But more importantly, I'm sowing into my children's lives.
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:31.460]   Now in that situation, I was very fortunate that I was able to invite a friend of ours,
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:38.060]   a family who is a missionary family, who lives on overseas support, some local support and
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.900]   overseas support.
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.800]   And I was able to invite them along.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.860]   And it was a nice thing where I was able to combine two things.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:48.540]   I was able to take them to a place where they would never be able to afford.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.660]   I was able to take them along, pay for all of the expenses, have a really fun time with
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.580]   a missionary family that has children that are similar age as my children.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.580]   We had a great time.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.500]   It wasn't, we didn't sit around and open our Bibles up and have four hour Bible studies.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.460]   We just hung out by the pool and we had a great time.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.140]   But I was spending money and doing it in faith.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.300]   On the other hand, there are little expenditures where often I sense the Lord check me.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.340]   I was like, "No, you don't need to waste money on that.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.680]   Don't spend money on that."
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:17.420]   And I feel like that's how it should be.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.700]   I'm not trying to raise myself up as an example, just trying to share from personal experience.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.540]   I'm responsible with my time and I'm responsible with the money.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:28.000]   But I'm responsible to ask the Lord, how does he want the time and the money to be spent?
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.380]   And that in that process, we're cultivating the relationship with God that is genuinely
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:38.120]   powerful or it's not a matter of a divine mandate that thou shalt give 10% of thy funds
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.820]   to thy local temple.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:44.700]   No, it's a matter of, "Lord, what do you want me to do today in it?"
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:50.860]   And what I would say to buttress my position is I would say, what did Jesus say?
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:57.340]   Jesus said that when he was preaching at the end of his life, he says that the advocate,
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:03.300]   the helper, the comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.100]   teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:14.100]   He will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:19.420]   And so my final answer after that somewhat confused monologue is simply that God, the
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:25.140]   Holy Spirit has promised to teach you, Christ has promised that the Holy Spirit will teach
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.140]   you all things.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:30.140]   And so if you want to learn how to manage money and how you should manage your money,
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.140]   ask God.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.540]   Ask him, how do you want me to manage my money?
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:38.860]   And I'm content personally with there being a wide range of answers to that question.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.460]   And I rejoice in hearing people's testimonies.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.460]   It's fun to share your own testimonies of God providing for you.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:51.980]   And I can believe wholeheartedly that it's absolutely within God's will for one person
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:57.380]   to be a missionary, living on faith, living on support and contributions from another
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.300]   person, never knowing where their money is going to come from tomorrow.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:04.660]   And I have no – I don't believe that person is unspiritual if they have no retirement
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.740]   savings, if they have no savings for a car.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:14.020]   I could sit here and talk for another hour about firsthand stories that I have heard
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:18.180]   of God's miraculous provision for people that I know.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:21.180]   Right when they needed it, God provided for them.
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:29.000]   I also have no issue whatsoever of recognizing that just because one person is a missionary
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.220]   in a little mud hut in Africa doesn't mean that another person isn't a missionary in
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:41.460]   a skyscraper in New York or in an expensive swanky college town or in anything.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.820]   I often feel like one of the things that I do wish is I wish that more people would approach
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:49.180]   their life and their jobs as missionaries.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.980]   And I'll just close with this just personal thing.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   Feel free to ignore this.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:30:00.360]   I believe that we as people – notice I didn't say Christians – but I believe that we as
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.960]   people have an obligation to help our neighbors.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.440]   God's commandments are not exclusively for Christians, which is why I generally don't
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.440]   talk to Christians.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.840]   I generally talk to people because God's commands are for all of us and all of us are
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.440]   required to love our neighbor, whether you're a Christian or not.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.280]   We all are commanded by God to love our neighbor and to provide for our neighbor.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.400]   I appreciate and I see good work coming from all kinds of relief companies.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.560]   I'm happy about that Charity Water, who to my knowledge has nothing to do with any
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.480]   kind of religious thing, is digging wells for people all around the world.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.560]   I think that's great.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.160]   I'm happy that Samaritan's Purse is doing relief work all around the world in the name
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160]   of Jesus.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.680]   I think that's fine.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:44.040]   But I'll tell you what I do wish we had more of, is I wish we had more people who didn't
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.120]   do relief work but just preached.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.960]   I've spent a significant amount of time in some expat missionary communities and I've
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:57.480]   observed that it seems to me, feels like about 80% of modern missions is related to relief
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.200]   projects, right?
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.080]   Feeding the hungry and helping the poor and whatnot.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:05.800]   And it feels, it's very unusual for me to come across a missionary who's focused on
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.120]   preaching and that's what they're doing is they're preaching.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.720]   They're not setting up a food camp or something, they're preaching.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:11.960]   I understand why that is.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.760]   It's easier, it seems easier to most people to get donations and support when they can
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:20.480]   say, "Well, look at this project that I'm doing and support this project."
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:25.120]   But just a personal plea to my missionary friends that listen and to those of us who
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.920]   support missionaries financially so that they can be full-time engaged in preaching, is
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:36.800]   that I would love to see more of our work and our effort focus on preaching and teaching
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.680]   and a little bit less on relief.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.800]   I am wholeheartedly a supporter of relief work.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.480]   I've publicly supported projects here.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.120]   I've used donations, which I need to give an updated report on some of the work that
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.680]   we've done, and I've not used any donations from the audience to support preaching and
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.680]   teaching.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.800]   But I think that we could do a lot more in the world of preaching and teaching and that
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.600]   I believe that if we ask God and say, "God, where do you want your money going?"
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.680]   I've never experienced him not to answer that.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.680]   So that's my answer, Dan.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.680]   Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.680]   I'm sure that you've heard these topics, which I appreciate, to be examples from the
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:09.680]   Christmas march.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.680]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680]   I'm glad to be here.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:18.840]   I'm glad you asked the question because I've had on my list of shows, I've had shows to
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.760]   talk about, or I've had topics to say, "Oh, let me talk about tithing," or "Let me talk
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.240]   about giving," and whatnot.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.400]   In fact, I actually do want to do a lot on giving.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.520]   I have a lot of this.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.960]   I do have a lot of it that I can do, some from a Christian context, but a lot of it
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.700]   just from a "here's how you think about it" context.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:44.500]   But what's difficult is, as you see with my 45-minute monologue, there's so much involved.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.900]   And what you find is you think, "Oh, talking about tithing should be simple."
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:52.920]   Well, some people can do it simply, but it's actually a really, really difficult theological
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.020]   issue to talk through.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.580]   Most people, thankfully, don't understand it, but there's some big issues associated
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.580]   with it.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:05.740]   And so, you know, with my predilection towards thinking about things comprehensively, it
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.740]   makes it difficult for me to do.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:11.620]   So I'm glad you asked the question, and I hope that our comments and my comments were
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:16.220]   useful to the audience as we wrap up today's show.
