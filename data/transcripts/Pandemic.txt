[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam and Cindy from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, we
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.100]   want to relive the pandemic days, because the pandemic was really an experience in hedging
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:23.560]   our lives. On May 11 2023, the federal government lifted the public health emergency for COVID-19.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.380]   So officially, the pandemic is over, even though supposedly something like 40,000 people
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.160]   have died year to date due to COVID-19. But life must go on. And in this episode, I just
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.440]   wanted to recap what life was like in 2020, what we did during the pandemic, and what
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.800]   we should have done. So, Cindy, what are your thoughts now that the pandemic is officially
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.680]   declared over? I'm so happy. And it's been a long way coming. I feel like I was starting
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.800]   to get a lot more comfortable in the last year. But especially this year, it's people,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.120]   I think in San Francisco as well, in general are just a lot more comfortable that things
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.600]   have, you know, we've moved on, we were not getting sick anymore. And we're living our
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.480]   lives to the fullest again. Yeah, we actually went to several packed events. And we didn't
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   have kind of any worry, nobody wore masks anymore. And it just it just seems surreal,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.000]   though, because I think we forget what life was like, maybe in 2020. And 2021, if we don't
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.240]   really drill down to the details. I remember in early 2020, as soon after the lockdowns,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.680]   the public parks were closed in San Francisco. And I was thinking to myself, what do you
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.640]   mean the public parks, the playgrounds are closed, it's outdoor space. Come on now. And
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   so what happened the first two weeks was, we ended up doing a lot of chalk drawings
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.880]   on the cement in our backyard. And I still have this video, this really heartwarming,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.480]   but sad video of our son, walking up a chalk drawing ladder and then scooting his butt
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.800]   down the chalk drawing slide. And that was kind of the moment where I thought to myself,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.360]   you know what, screw the parks being closed. We're gonna go to the damn park. Yeah, it
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.600]   was very happy sad to see that. I mean, super happy sad. I was like, we know it was happy
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.120]   because we try to make do with what we had. And he was smiling. And he was smiling. And
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.720]   he was like, Oh, this is how you slide if pretend slide, but then it made me sad and
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.080]   also angry that something like this could happen that you know, our freedom, our freedom
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.240]   was restricted. And for someone who has been free since 2012, and you since 2015, I was
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   I was like, there, there's no way you're gonna keep me down. Yeah, and keep our children
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.720]   down. So let's discuss some of the things that we did do during the 2020 and 2021 period,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.920]   to try to hedge against our life because one of the reasons why I decided to leave work
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.720]   behind at 34 was to hedge against an early death. I figured if I left at 34, and I lived
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.000]   until 60, and age 60 was the age that I thought, okay, just give me until age 60. And then
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.120]   I'll live a happy life. And I thought about that when I was in my 20s. Then I could live,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.880]   you know, like 2526 years of the good life, not having maximum amount of money because
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.080]   I'm not working more, but a life full of freedom. And then if I passed away, you know, that
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.520]   would suck. But at least I would minimize my regret. There were just too many close
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.680]   calls that happened in my life, where I wasn't constantly aware of my mortality. And so when
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.560]   the pandemic hit, I immediately thought to myself, okay, if we live through this pandemic,
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.960]   which we probably would have, but then we kept our lives like, like we were living in
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.560]   prison, we would probably really get pissed off about this time period. And then so we
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.320]   had to do something to make sure that we didn't look back with regret. So let's talk about
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.560]   several positives. The first positive is we had our daughter in December 2019. We had
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.680]   no idea what was coming. We had no idea it was it was serendipitous. We plan to stay
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.520]   at home for at least two years after she was born anyway. And so in retrospect, how was
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.840]   raising a baby like during the pandemic for you? Initially, it wasn't it wasn't that different.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.240]   I mean, we were really lucky that we didn't have to deal with any of the hospital lockdowns
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.760]   because she was born in December. Oh, yeah, and I could actually be there for the yeah,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.320]   and you were able to be there. We didn't have any of stress around the birth. So we were
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.760]   lucky that way. I think we were just more we weren't so worried about leaving the house.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   We were worried about getting through each night, you know, is she gonna sleep? So we
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.440]   kept our minds off of a lot of the, you know, the lockdown part because we were busy, you
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.280]   know, being parents being parents. Yeah. You know, when you first have a baby, it's all
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   about care and making sure they survive. Yeah, things like sudden infant death syndrome and
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   choking on something and all that is already really heightened. And so for me, the pandemic
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.200]   just kind of heightened that risk of death even further. Right? We had to make sure that
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.720]   she especially was protected because she had the weakest immune system in the whole family.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   Basically, so that was something that, you know, I had to really contend with if I was
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   to go out to the playground, right, right. You know, I remember the first time I went
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.880]   to the playground, I got the alcohol wipes and just wipe down the swings and the slides
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.920]   just in case, right? Yeah. And of course, you know, we wore masks that the first several
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.880]   times because just in case well, why risk it? But raising a baby during a pandemic in
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.320]   retrospect was good. So if there is a have you believe there's a future pandemic coming?
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.000]   I think you know, having a baby then is actually a good idea because you want to spend as much
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.560]   time raising your child anyway. And also for the people who are able to work at home while
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.440]   having a newborn, you know, it was definitely a struggle to do both work and childcare.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.600]   But I think it was also a blessing where so many families were able to pop in check in
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.080]   and all that. Right. One of the analogies I thought about regarding having a baby during
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.440]   the pandemic was, let's say your flight is delayed, or you're stuck on the highway because
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.280]   of an accident for several hours. And you have your favorite book, which in this case
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.200]   would be your baby. You would just read your book, you would take care of your baby and
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.120]   make use of that time. And actually, the best time to take care of your baby or read the
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.640]   book is during a very difficult time. Because whether you spend an hour reading your book
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   on an airplane or in the lounge because of a five hour delay or at the beach, that hour
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.720]   is all the same. The second positive of the pandemic is we bought a house, we bought a
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:44.240]   larger house that we did not anticipate buying because we bought a fixer in 2019. However,
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.040]   after going through the permitting and the remodeling, I soon realized this house was
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.880]   not going to get finished in time to house our growing family. So it was really, really
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.000]   hairy times buying a house that I saw in April 2020. We got into contract in May and we closed
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.960]   I think end of July 2020. Super, super difficult time decision to leverage up and buy a property.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.640]   But I believe that well, worst case scenario, the house price declines another 5-10%, maybe
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:24.280]   10%. And at least I get to shelter our larger family in a fully remodeled home. So what
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.520]   are your thoughts on buying that house? Because I remember before buying this house, you were
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.080]   pretty hesitant. Well, I'm always resistant to moving because of the logistics and whatnot.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.920]   And once I get settled, it's hard for me to want to move. So thinking about moving at
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.720]   that time was hard. But in retrospect, I'm really glad we did it. We love this house.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I'm really happy here. The kids love it. It's good layout for us. And we maximized it to
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.280]   the full extent during the pandemic and still now too. Yeah. There's more levels. So there's
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:10.040]   actually more privacy in terms of sound noise, which is good for writers like myself who
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.880]   need peace and quiet to write. And there's more space. It's like 50% larger. Yeah. Because
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.520]   our old house, you know, we had lost, we demolished like 600 square feet of space. And then it
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.000]   was just, it's just so much better now. Yeah. And even though like construction was halted
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.960]   for the longest time, the fact that we were able to move out and not have to live through
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.480]   that was huge because we, you and I did that before kids, we, we lived through a remodel,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:47.200]   a gut remodel. Wow. That was, that was tough. That was tough. We were like living on a day
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   bed. This was one night. It's interesting. We were living on this day bed. That was just
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.320]   two of us, right? Just thinking back to college and then twin size, twin size. And then did
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:04.480]   I have the, it was my epiphany to, it was like the couch, what is it called? Like a
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.680]   sofa bed. Right. So I was like, okay, why, why are we both sleeping side by side on this
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   twin size sofa bed? So I was like, Oh, okay. Hey, look, the mattress lifts up. Let's put
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.120]   that on the floor. And then one of us can sleep on that. And the other one can sleep
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   on the sofa without the mattress on it. And it worked out much better. Yeah. Are you sure
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.920]   that was your idea? I'm sure it was my idea. That sounds like my genius. No, no, no, no,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.080]   no. But this one was mine, but this is a great, great idea. Um, so props to you. And this
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.880]   is an example of how you see like a problem and then you just, well, or a situation, you
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.240]   just accept it, but sometimes you just don't want to accept, you shouldn't accept it. There's
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:51.040]   a better solution. Yeah. You got to let your ideas percolate in your mind. Yeah. This reminds
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.080]   me of a story when I was in high school, uh, or maybe it was middle school. I was first
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.240]   learning how to write an address on an envelope. And so I was writing the address on the envelope
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.620]   because you know, you put your return to sender address on the top left and then to whoever
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.240]   in the middle. Right. So I was writing it and, and then, and then I turned over the
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.280]   envelope. I was like, Oh, I wrote the address upside down. I was about to rip it up and
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.920]   throw it away. And my dad was like, what are you doing? It's okay. It doesn't really
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.880]   matter. You can just put the, you know, I was like, Oh, okay. Don't waste the envelope.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.520]   But I didn't even think about that. So I wonder how many things are like no dumb moments where
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.680]   you don't really think about where you can improve. So given I was able to convince you
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.080]   to come to this house, it's like so much better over the past almost three years. What are
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.160]   your thoughts on, you know, getting a larger house? I knew you'd ask me that. You know,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.120]   like the pain of packing and moving and the cost is, is, is terrible in the beginning.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.200]   But if it lasts, if we last in a new house, bigger house for 10 more years, wouldn't that
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   be pretty amazing? Yeah. It's just for me, I don't know. I feel like we don't need more
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.000]   space. And again, I'm harder to convince because once I get settled in, I just don't want to
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.280]   move. And we've also fixed a lot of things in this house. We know where the potential
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.360]   leaks are. We've, we've repaired them. You know, we know this house inside and out now.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.880]   So to start from scratch again, I don't know. It's just, well, you know, this is really
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.920]   interesting because I wonder how many people because they just don't want to go through
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:39.960]   the short term pain of something better. Never go after their dreams. Who knows if that's
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.360]   actually going to be better though? Well, everything is a risk. Everything is a leap
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.640]   of faith. Yeah. All I know is that the house that we live in is fantastic. We're happy
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:56.880]   here. There's no need or sense of urgency to move. There's never a need to do anything
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.520]   once you have the basics. That's the thing. But as I wrote, wrote in the past, the best
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.080]   time to own the nicest house you can afford is when you have children, when you have the
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:13.640]   most number of heartbeats at home. But don't forget classic tale of Warren Buffett who
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.320]   still lives in his same house that he bought in his what, thirties? Yeah. His house is
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.600]   like 7,000 square feet. It's like massive. And who knows? There might be an underground
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   bunker that goes two levels down. That's another 5,000. That would be very interesting. I bet.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.520]   I bet there's some, I mean, he flies private and does whatever. So yes. And Warren Buffett
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.240]   example. All right, cool. So we're going to move to another house. All right. Good. Good.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:43.240]   Good that we agreed. So three, another positive. We homeschooled our son. Yeah. You know, Oh,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.880]   but the funny thing is, is that it's not funny. It's like we spent two years trying to get
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.160]   him into preschool. Yeah, I know. And then we spend like a thousand dollars in application
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.120]   fees. He got it. He got into preschool and then five months later we pulled him. Yeah,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   that was tough. It was tough, but it was definitely tough to lose that spot. But we did have some
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.360]   reassurance that we could get him back in if we needed to. Yeah. And we just weren't
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:18.120]   comfortable putting him at risk and then him at risk, us at risk and more importantly,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.920]   our daughter at risk. Oh, you know what? Now I, now I remember before we pulled him, he
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.200]   was getting sick all the time in those five months and we were too, and we were too. And
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.880]   I was miserable. I was like, gosh, we're sending our kid to preschool for him to get sick.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.020]   And then for all of us to get sick. So if all of us got sick, that means our baby would
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.840]   get sick. Yeah. And then when, when the school did reopen, I think it was late in the summer
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:47.620]   of 2020 it was, it was limited. Like, Oh yeah. Hybrid. And I think it only started with three
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:54.220]   hours a day that would be all in the outside. Even if it was dumping rain, we were just,
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.740]   you know, taking all the different factors into consideration and it just, we didn't
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.880]   feel right about it. And I think it all worked out well in the end. He didn't end up needing
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.840]   to go back to that school. Uh, and we had a great time with him. Yes, it was exhausting,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.360]   but it was fun. And he learned so much from us and he was so excited too. We were like,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:20.080]   do you want to go to homeschool or real school? And he's like, homeschool. And now I, and
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.680]   now I realize also another reason why we didn't send him back. It's because we have the flexibility
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.860]   to homeschool them. Yeah. We were very fortunate. So my thinking back then was, okay, we both
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.920]   don't have day jobs. We had the flexibility to homeschool them. If we don't homeschool
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.860]   them and he gets COVID and gets really sick and he gets our daughter sick, how would we
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.300]   live with ourselves? We would basically, I would feel bad because it would just basically
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.540]   be laziness to not homeschool them because we could homeschool them. And I realized that
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:55.060]   not everybody has that opportunity or ability because of work. Yeah. And then there's also
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.940]   the positive that we saved like $2,000 a month from the preschool tuition. Yeah. All right.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:06.380]   Four, uh, lost some weight. I lost, I first, I gained some weight, you know, like if you
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:12.140]   have, well, you, you had a baby, so you, you, you have all the reasons to be able to gain
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.980]   weight. Uh, but you know, the combination of new baby and a pandemic being locked down,
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:25.260]   less social activity is not a great combination. It was hard. Yeah. But because I played a
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:32.260]   lot of tennis and then I played a lot of softball, like softball almost every Saturday. Uh, and
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:38.860]   then I saw like pictures after pictures by the media about people dying from COVID and
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.860]   the number one consistent thing of the people dying or that they were obese or morbidly
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.660]   obese. It just kind of scared me into trying to lose that weight that I had gained and
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:56.180]   try to be more healthy in general. How about yourself? Like how did you, how did you view
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.660]   those pictures and how did you view health during the pandemic? I mean, I definitely
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.460]   felt scared. I mean, if you, when you pay attention to too many news articles, it can
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:14.260]   send you into a panic, you know? So I, I definitely curtailed my, um, news consumption during
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:20.020]   the pandemic. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I tried, tried to try to eat well. I mean, I had to
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.620]   stay healthy because I was still breastfeeding. Um, you know, I didn't exercise as much as
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.180]   I could have and should have. Um, but you know, as time went on, things got better.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.740]   Um, you know, we got outdoors more, I got moving more, uh, and you know, you sure there
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.380]   were days where I had to eat my feelings because it was so stressed and tired. Um, but I think
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.980]   in general we did prioritize our health. Um, and you know, we got through it. Yeah. I mean,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.660]   it was very basic. It was like, do you want to live longer? Uh, do you want to be able
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:59.180]   to combat COVID if you, if we do get it, um, by being in better shape? And the answer was
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.140]   yes, especially when you have a newborn. Yeah. So five, we made some money and then we lost
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:11.420]   some money like 2020, 2021 boom times for risk assets, right? Um, buying the house turned
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:17.660]   out to be a good move. And then the stocks that we did hold turned out to be good. And
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   then the muni bonds that I sold to come up with a down payment for this house ended up
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.820]   going well, they went up in 2020, but then went down to any one and then 2022 for sure
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:37.200]   by about 13%. Um, so that was a good move. Yeah. Um, so making money was what actually
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.380]   made going through the pandemic a little bit more palatable. Unfortunately, you know, we
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:48.580]   gave up a lot of our gains from 2021 because of the bear market in 2022, but there was
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:55.180]   also another positive about the pandemic and that was so many different ideas for content
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.700]   on financial samurai. Yeah. Because of the pandemic, I, I spent it up, I ended up writing
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.300]   more and then I wrote a post called how to predict a stock market bottom like Nostradamus
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.100]   in March, 2020. So that turned out well, wrote a post called real estate buying strategies
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.220]   during COVID-19. And that turned out well, if you took some of that advice and basically
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   I was writing about stuff that I was thinking about doing. And in general, almost all the
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.660]   time, if I'm writing about something, I'm thinking about it and I'm going to try to
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:31.100]   take action to do something. And then I spent time focusing more on online entrepreneurship
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.340]   because when you're stuck at home and you have an online website, you have a website
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.180]   that you might as well try to make more money. And in turn, because of these new business
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.660]   relationships, I think it's helped me at least feel more comfortable about providing for
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.860]   the family. Yeah. And then finally, what, uh, what happened? Let's see, wrote a bestselling
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.980]   book by this, not that, that was, that was not an easy task. That was not an easy task.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:04.500]   The offer came in at the end of 2019. I wasn't really that gung ho about writing because
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.580]   I had written how to engineer your layoff and which has recently been updated thanks
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:17.020]   to you and your work for 2023. But then once the pandemic hit, I was like, all right, well,
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.860]   we're going to be locked down for who knows how long might as well take up this off this
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.440]   offer because I don't know in the future, I think if I look back, I would regret not
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.980]   having written this book. So this book basically took up the entire pandemic to write, edit
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:39.720]   and market because it came out July 19, 2022 and it became a Wall Street Journal bestseller.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:46.200]   So this is something that I'm super proud of because when our kids ask, Hey, do you
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.000]   remember what happened during the pandemic? Well, hopefully they'll remember, like at
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.920]   least our son will know. Yeah. But our daughter might not remember, right? She probably won't
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.880]   remember, but I'll just say, you know, daddy and mommy, we decided to write an editor book
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.100]   that did well to help other people achieve financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:10.780]   So overall, the pandemic, because we survived and because we don't have long COVID, I think
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.860]   was maybe a net positive. I wouldn't have written the book. I wouldn't have bought this
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.180]   house. I wouldn't have made as much as we did from risk assets. I wouldn't have spent
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:26.240]   as much time with our son. Right. So it sounds like win-win-wins. However, there are always
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:33.500]   regrets. And so I have several regrets that we didn't do during the pandemic. What's your
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.300]   biggest one? The biggest one, the absolute biggest one was that we didn't move to Honolulu,
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.740]   Hawaii before the pandemic began or the first year of the pandemic. I had been looking intently
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:52.100]   since 2016 to buy a nice property in Honolulu, Hawaii. Right. You were with me, right? When
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.700]   we saw like, went to see some open houses, nothing really, you know, captivated us. Oh,
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.620]   no, no, no. Okay. There are some amazing houses, but they were out of our, you know, they're
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:08.780]   expensive. Yeah. There's this amazing house, like 4,600 square feet, five bedroom, five
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.220]   bath writers den. And it wasn't even just a den. It was like a full one bedroom, one
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.660]   bath with a living room and kitchen like off the side of the house. And then there was
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:24.460]   a pool and it was only a block and a half away from the beach. And I was just like,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:29.380]   oh, this house is amazing. This is awesome. We saw it so many times. We did. Over the
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.020]   years. And you know, the prices were, it kept on ticking down. I was like, oh, okay, let's
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.220]   wait a little bit longer. Tick down a little further. Well, there were just some quirky
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.220]   things. I don't know. Like what? What was quirky about? Oh, there was like, the way
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.740]   they did the kitchen was kind of weird. There was like two kitchens stuck together. That's
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.820]   cool. That's the back kitchen in the front kitchen. They could have designed it better.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.020]   And that was like the interesting Mormon church across the street or something. Yeah, there
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:02.100]   was that was congregation czar. Yeah. So there was a lot of foot traffic and not that much.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.540]   I don't know. We saw a lot of people coming and going. Bottom line, we should have bought
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.820]   that house because we don't enjoy that house with a lot more space. Just being in Hawaii.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:17.500]   Think about it for two years during the pandemic before they started prohibiting visitors,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.700]   international visitors, and then just being able to spend more time with my parents. I
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.140]   know it's not with your parents, but we didn't see your parents anyway during the pandemic.
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:31.820]   So you know, the bottom line is, man, I really wish I had the guts to pull the trigger to
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.180]   buy that house in Hawaii. You know, there's two hard things. I pulled the trigger to buy
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.860]   this house in the most difficult of times. But it's another thing to pull the trigger
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.420]   to buy an expensive house and move your entire family. Yeah, I would have been very hard
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.820]   to convince to especially with a newborn. Yeah, that's the thing. The new when you have
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.700]   a newborn, you have doctors you're familiar with. You know, you have issues where you
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:02.100]   have to heal and see checkups. But the thing here's the thing, though, Hawaii has the best
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:08.380]   health care. I know. It's just it's, you know, moving within your city is one thing but moving
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.740]   to another city and then actually out of state and Hawaii is an island right you can't drive
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.500]   there you have to fly there I don't know it's just very different moving logistics. I know
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.140]   but man I've been thinking about this for seven years now since 2016. It's okay. We
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.020]   have a great house now we're happy here. It's all good. Next time. Next time there's pandemic
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:33.980]   where we're gone. I swear to God, we're we're we're going. So to one of the regrets I thought
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.140]   was regret but then I thought about a little more maybe not a regret. I didn't fly more
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:45.420]   often. So best got really lucky that time you did fly. Yeah, November 20. Yeah, because
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:51.620]   right after you came back, there was a big surge. So you escaped that. But you think
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:58.500]   about it like 2020 2021 flights were cheaper. True. It's less crowded. It's probably safer
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:04.580]   because there's less people. But I now realize I remember now, anybody who did travel or
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.180]   seen as traveling for non essential reasons, were seen as selfish. You know, we were all
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.020]   trying to contain the spread as much as possible. So if you're going to go you know, to Bali
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.340]   to Hawaii, I remember that now like people were flying and sharing on Instagram or whatever
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:23.100]   how fabulous their lives were shamed by Yeah, so there was that social pressure and also
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:29.340]   the unknown of and again, if I flew somewhere, I might catch something on the way back because
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:34.580]   it's like so stupid, right? Like everybody was afraid of getting COVID outdoors or in
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.500]   lines so that we social distanced at the airport. And then you you all pack into a plane. I
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.900]   know. I know. I remember reading some headline to about someone who rented an RV to like
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.460]   drive across the country, but which was great for her. But then she ended up getting like,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.580]   shamed by the media for it because she was endangering other people by crossing state
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.900]   lines and yada yada yada. There was a lot of shame being thrown around. Yeah, there's
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:08.460]   peer pressure. Yeah. And so I guess I'm proud to say that we did not contribute to the pandemic.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:15.140]   We didn't travel until I traveled in November 2021. Yeah, after the vaccine, I think was
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:20.060]   available then. Yeah, yeah, it was available. And even if we wanted to travel to like places
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.220]   like Asia, there were two week quarantine periods. You get there and you got to stay
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   in a hotel for maybe tolerable by yourself, but no, not with a whole family. No, no, no,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:38.660]   no. All right, third regret should have owned a vacation single family home instead of a
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.460]   vacation condo. This was interesting, because we have friends who have vacation properties
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:51.900]   in Napa Sonoma, Lake Tahoe, Stinson Beach, these are 45 minutes to three and a half hour
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.260]   drives away. And they were able to live a more enjoyable life during the pandemic because
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.940]   they could just drive there and mix things up. Right. And the whole the whole property
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.820]   is their own. They don't have to worry about other people. Exactly. So we on the other
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:13.300]   hand, own a condo at a resort. So we could have gone up there, but not in the earlier
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.980]   early early days because the resort closed down. Yes, it did. So it closed down for at
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.260]   least three months, maybe six, I don't remember. It was and it was like sudden to whenever
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.500]   there was a surge was like, Okay, we're shutting down. And we're like, wait, what's happening?
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.420]   And right. And so not only could we not go up there, we couldn't even earn rental income.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:40.020]   Yeah, exactly. So it was like a lot of reservations that had to be canceled because of the closures.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.780]   So this is something good to know, folks. If you own a single family property as a vacation
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.660]   property, you're the king and queens of the castle, you can do what you want, you don't
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:54.020]   have to fear people using your stuff, sleeping in your beds, whatever it is. But now that
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.300]   the pandemic is over, I did ask our kids, do you like the Lake Tahoe vacation property,
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.940]   or this really nice single family home, our friend owns in Sonoma Valley, and they all
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:11.820]   said the condo vacation property. Because even though the condo is 80% cheaper than
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.860]   the single family vacation property, our friend owns, it's actually way bigger, right? The
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:23.740]   land is like 10x bigger, many more amenities and things to do. All right. Finally, there's
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.500]   a couple more regrets and has to do with investing. One I was thinking, maybe I should have speculated
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.940]   more, I should have been more intentional, and allocated a certain amount of money to
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:41.380]   speculate on all these wild and crazy things like meme stocks, crypto and NFTs. You wrote
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.260]   a post about NFTs. And at the end of the post, you're like, what the hell is this stupid?
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.220]   Who's the hell is buying this? But the thing is, folks, it kind of doesn't really matter
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:57.140]   how stupid the asset is. If you make money, if you buy it, and it goes up 5x, and you
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.060]   sell, you make a lot of money. So the idea is to be a good investor, you need to actually
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:06.540]   recognize the trends. And no matter how dumb the investment is, it's like if capital is
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.840]   flying towards these investments, you want to be involved. But you can't make this type
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.040]   of speculative money if you don't pay attention. So in retrospect, I should have specifically
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.460]   allocated a lump sum of money. And maybe I should have spent an hour a day trying to
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.020]   speculate. But this is a revisionist history. I mean, maybe I could have lost my shirt as
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:31.100]   well. Yeah. And then finally, I should have sold more stock, de-risked more when valuations
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   in the tech field, tech sector, we're getting out of control at the end of 2021. And if
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:44.260]   that happened, we wouldn't have round tripped many of our big gains from 2020 and 2021.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:52.740]   But thankfully, hopefully, all of you are wealthier now than you were in early 2020.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:59.540]   So that's basically it talked about some positives, some negatives. The worst negative, of course,
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:06.020]   are the deaths due to the virus. And we can never get back those lives. So we have to
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.100]   remember them and we have to appreciate our lives. What are your thoughts in conclusion
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:16.860]   about the past two and a half, three years? Well, I'm I'm proud that we got through it
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:23.580]   and that we were productive during the time. And it's definitely something that we will
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:30.340]   remember forever. Yeah, most definitely. We need to spend more time with our loved ones,
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:36.300]   our parents, if they're still around, our uncles and aunts and our nieces and nephews.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:42.380]   You know, I'm reading the Good Life book about the 80 year Harvard longitudinal study about
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:47.860]   what makes a good life. And the consistent theme is having good relationships with the
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:54.140]   people you care about the most and also having some soft relationships with just people you
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:31:00.300]   see infrequently as well to keep in touch, to listen, to understand, to empathize with
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:06.020]   their situation, and to just be there for them in times of need. Because the longer
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:12.260]   we live, the more good and bad things will happen. And so just just having more kindness
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:17.740]   and having more patience is so important. And that's something that I have tried to
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:24.100]   adopt and I will adopt going forward. Because for all of us, I think it was difficult times.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:30.220]   Well, we try to look at the positives, and we try to be productive and take action. Because
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.380]   if there's another one coming, I think we're going to be better prepared. Yeah, there's
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:41.820]   going to be less fear obviously depends on the virality of the next virus. But I think
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.780]   we're going to get through it better. Yeah, and I think all of us will. So we'd love to
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:52.740]   hear from all of you on what were some of the positives and some of the negatives and
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.700]   the regrets during the past two and a half years of the pandemic. Really try to think
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.140]   back to the months of March, April, May, June, July, August of 2020. Because it's easy to
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.580]   forget. And it's easy for me to forget. And the only reason why I haven't forgotten is
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:15.540]   because I wrote a lot of posts back then. And I recorded a lot of episodes back then.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.020]   And this has been one of my main reasons for keeping Financial Samurai going for so long
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:27.300]   is so that I won't forget because experiences tend to appreciate over time. And experiences,
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.180]   if you remember them, help teach you more about the past, you can live a better future.
