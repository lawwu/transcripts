[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Most of you, I'm sure, will remember that at the end of last May, when we completed
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.360]   our last session, we found that we had come to the end of the eighth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.600]   epistle to the Romans, so that we start this evening at the beginning of chapter nine.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.840]   Now, here we are not only starting the consideration of a new chapter, we are also starting the
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.280]   consideration of a new section in this mighty epistle to the Romans, and it is a section
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.520]   that includes chapters nine, ten, and eleven.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.080]   Now this is a very famous section of Scripture, and rightly and justly regarded as a famous
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.920]   section of Scripture, but that of course leads me to add that it's a section that we obviously
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.600]   must approach with care and with understanding.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.640]   What then is the new section, and what is its relationship to that which has gone before?
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.040]   That's the first question to ask.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.240]   Whenever you come to any new section of Scripture, it is always a wise procedure to put that
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520]   question to yourself and put it to the writer.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   Why is there a new section, and what exactly is it, and what is its relationship to that
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.960]   which has gone before it?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.240]   Now there are those who would say that at the end of chapter eight we came to the end
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.320]   of the doctrinal section of the epistle to the Romans, and that here the great apostle
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.960]   begins to take up particular subjects and questions and problems.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   They say he's really finished with the great doctrine of salvation at the end of chapter
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.680]   eight, and now there is no more doctrine as such, but he takes up certain problems and
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.760]   difficulties which he deals with right until the end of the epistle.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:18.000]   But we are compelled to reject that idea as to what happens here immediately and entirely,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.120]   because for this good and sufficient reason that there is a great deal of very high and
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   important doctrine in this particular section.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.000]   We have already in the reading, even in the brief reading which we had at the beginning,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.360]   we have already seen that at once he becomes involved in tremendous doctrine.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   And as I am hoping to show you, some of the great reaches of doctrine are dealt with in
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.400]   this particular section.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.040]   So then what is it?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.240]   What is it we have here exactly?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.120]   Well I prefer to put it like this.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   At the end of chapter eight, the great apostle certainly had finished with his treatment
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.560]   of the doctrine of salvation from the standpoint of the individual believer.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.180]   Now I think that's quite clear.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.600]   Up until the end of chapter eight he has been dealing with the way in which anyone is saved.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.160]   He has dealt with the doctrine of justification and of sanctification and of glorification.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.340]   And in addition to that, as we saw, he shows us the final certainty of our entire deliverance
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.180]   in the whole matter of glorification.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.760]   But all along there he has been dealing with it mainly from the standpoint of the individual
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.300]   believer.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.100]   He says this is the way of salvation, this is the doctrine of salvation which applies
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.180]   to every single believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.060]   And of course by the end of chapter eight he really has dealt with it in its entirety
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.260]   because he has dealt with the subject of glorification.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.560]   And there's nothing beyond glorification.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.420]   Well then what is it that comes in here?
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.660]   What is the difference between this and that which has gone before?
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.460]   And I would say that the main answer is that he is now dealing with the doctrine of salvation
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.020]   and God's purpose in salvation in a more general manner.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.860]   He's not so much now concerned with it in terms of an individual believer.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.900]   He is dealing with it from a world standpoint, and in particular from the standpoint of Jew
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.860]   and Gentile.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.700]   So it's still a question of salvation, but no longer is he interested in what you may
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.060]   call the order of salvation, or the steps and stages in the individual's salvation.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.100]   He's looking at God's overall purpose in salvation.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.380]   And that of course is something which is different from what he has already been dealing with.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.620]   Very well then, how does he take this matter up?
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.940]   What is it, in other words, that brings him to deal with this?
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.940]   Why should he go on at all, having dealt with the ultimate glorification of the believer,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.620]   why not finish his epistle?
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.460]   Why does he especially introduce this section in chapters 9, 10, and 11?
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.340]   Now here again is to me a very interesting subject, and I'm a little bit unhappy at
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.540]   having to disagree at this point, as we've had to on one or two occasions before, with
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.660]   both Charles Hodge and Robert Haldane.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.220]   It's not a vitally important matter, but to me it's a very interesting one, because
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.980]   the straighter we can get our exposition, the better.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.660]   Now then, according to Charles Hodge, the apostle here, having dealt with the doctrine
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.140]   of salvation, takes up this question of the calling of the Gentiles and the rejection
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.660]   of the Jews.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.660]   What Charles Hodge, in other words, is saying is this.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.220]   He has dealt with the whole matter of salvation, the doctrine of salvation, but now he says,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.740]   'Well, I'd like to expound to you this question of why so many Jews are unbelievers
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.020]   and why Gentiles have come in.'
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.580]   He takes up a fresh subject and proceeds to deal with it.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.220]   I'm rejecting that.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.180]   Of course, he does that, but I'm saying that that is not his main object.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.980]   According to Charles Hodge, that is his main object and purpose.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.980]   What about Robert Haldane?
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.100]   Well, let me quote him to you.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.980]   He puts it like this.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.620]   He says, 'The apostle had discoursed largely on the justification and the sanctification
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.340]   of believers, and he now proceeds to treat particularly of the doctrine of predestination
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.740]   and to exhibit the sovereignty of God in his dealings both towards the Jews and Gentiles.'
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.860]   That's how Haldane puts it.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.460]   He has dealt with justification and sanctification.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.620]   He might have added glorification also, but he doesn't.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.620]   That's all right.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:13.260]   And now he says, 'He proceeds to deal particularly of the doctrine of predestination and to exhibit
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.260]   the sovereignty of God in his dealings both towards Jews and Gentiles.'
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:24.380]   So according to Hodge, the main object of this section is to deal with the doctrine
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.140]   of predestination and to illustrate it in that way.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.780]   I am rejecting that also.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.700]   Well then there is another idea that is often put forward, and it's quite a popular one
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.100]   amongst many evangelical people at the present time.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.100]   The moment you mention Romans 9, 10, and 11 to them, 'Ah,' they say, 'it's the question
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.460]   of the Jews, the Jews going back to the land, and the whole matter of the salvation of the
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.460]   Jews.'
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.340]   And they tend to think of these three chapters, this section, solely in terms of that.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.340]   It's a matter of prophetic teaching.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.780]   And they stop at that.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.020]   I reject that also.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.460]   Very well then, sir, somebody, if you are rejecting those three, what are you suggesting?
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:13.140]   Well now then, I put it to you that it's this.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.700]   I am suggesting that the apostle takes up this matter at the beginning of chapter 9
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.300]   and goes on dealing with it in the other two chapters also, because it was something that
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.900]   he had to do, as a good and as a wise teacher.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.980]   I am suggesting that the connection between this section and the previous one is a most
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.980]   intimate one.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.780]   It isn't that he's finished something and takes up something quite different.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:46.300]   This section to me follows logically from the previous section, and especially what
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.380]   he's been saying at the end of chapter 8.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:59.740]   I wouldn't hesitate to go so far as to say this, that this section here is inevitable,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.540]   because of what he's just been saying.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.180]   And what he's just been saying had reference, you remember, to the doctrine of the assurance
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:14.100]   of the believer, and in particular, the doctrine of the final perseverance of the believer.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.140]   Now that was the thing we dealt with at such great length, wasn't it?
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.260]   You see, that great section.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.060]   What shall we then say to these things?
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.820]   If God be for us, who can be against us?
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.300]   Leading up to the final climax, you remember, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.980]   life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:48.300]   height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.420]   which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.140]   That was it, you remember.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.860]   And the argument which we emphasized and underlined was this.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.220]   The final perseverance of the saints, the apostles argued, is absolutely certain for
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.980]   this reason, that it is God's purpose.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.940]   You remember it in verse 28.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:18.700]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   the called according to his purpose.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:30.100]   It's God's purpose that guarantees the final perseverance of the saints, the final glorification
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.100]   of all his people.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.940]   And then he went on to tell us that this great purpose had been worked out like this, that
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.900]   "whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.140]   he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.100]   That's the purpose, that's the object.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.620]   Well then, moreover, "Whom he did predestinate in that way, them he also called, and whom
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.980]   he called them he also justified, and whom he justified them he also glorified."
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.500]   God's purpose carried out in that way, and he says it's absolutely certain.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:06.260]   So you remember, we saw that he puts up four challengers, and he demolishes their argument.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:12.820]   It's absolutely certain, because it is the love of God in Christ Jesus, because it is
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.860]   the purpose of God.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:23.060]   And there is nothing and no one, in heaven or hell or anywhere else, that can make God
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.060]   his purpose for good, or sever my soul from his love.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.060]   Now then, that was it, wasn't it?
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.140]   It was a tremendous argument.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:40.820]   Our security is based upon the immutability of God's counsel, the guarantee that anything
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.540]   God has purposed must of necessity be carried out.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.420]   All right.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   Then the apostle imagines someone coming to him and saying, "Wait a minute, Paul, you're
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.740]   allowing your eloquence to carry you away.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.500]   You're getting thrilled with your own words.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.140]   You're putting up men of straw, and you're knocking them down, and it sounds very wonderful,
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.460]   but wait a minute.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.380]   What about the whole case of the Jews?
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.260]   You say that when God starts a thing, he always completes it.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.460]   You say that when something is the purpose of God, nothing can frustrate it.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.180]   But if your preaching of the Christian gospel, as you call it, is right, well then, God's
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.420]   purpose has gone very seriously astray.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:41.060]   Because behold, here is the fact, the vast majority of the Jews are not Christians.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.180]   They're not in what you call the kingdom of God.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.100]   They don't belong to what you call the Christian church.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.520]   They are outside it.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.220]   It consists chiefly of Gentile believers.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.620]   Now then, where is the purpose of God?
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.020]   Where is the immutability of God's counsel?
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.780]   How can you make this tremendous statement that God's purpose can never be frustrated
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:12.740]   when God's great purpose throughout the century, on your showing, has already gone seriously
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.100]   astray?
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.060]   That was the objection.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.260]   It was not an imaginary objection.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.700]   It is what the Jews were saying.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.980]   And they were saying it very loudly.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.860]   They were saying this man was a traitor.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.100]   Not only that, they'd got a second charge against him.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.620]   He said this man was throwing the Old Testament overboard.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.500]   The Old Testament, they say, is a book that concentrates on the Jews only, and all the
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   others are outside.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.060]   Here is something that brings the others in and the Jews are out.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.180]   He's throwing the Old Testament overboard.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.820]   He's denying the teaching concerning God and his purpose as it is outlined and worked out
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.140]   in the Old Testament.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.300]   Because the Old Testament, they say, is full of promises to the Jews.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.980]   And yet the position in the so-called Christian church seems to reverse everything.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.260]   The Gentiles are in and the Jews are out.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.740]   Very well then, it seems to me that the apostle takes up this matter because he has to deal
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.540]   with that difficulty and with that objection.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.500]   It is not an entirely new section, therefore.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.300]   It follows from the previous one.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.860]   Now then, the apostle takes up the challenge.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.100]   He deals with this argument and he refutes it in his own way.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.700]   Now what's so interesting to me is this, that the apostle here, once more, is doing something
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.540]   that he's already done several times in this one epistle.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.420]   He's got a method, you see.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.540]   And he always uses the same method.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.780]   He used it because there wasn't a better one.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.980]   It is the perfect method of teaching.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   What he does is this.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.580]   He makes his statements, then he deals with objections and difficulties and answers them.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.020]   Now we've seen him doing this.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.900]   Let me show you.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.700]   You see, he began his great doctrine in the sixteenth verse of the first chapter.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.740]   Here he lays down his great doctrine in verses sixteen and seventeen of chapter one.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.980]   Sixteen, seventeen and eighteen of chapter one.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.620]   Then you remember he works it out in terms of Gentiles and Jews.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.300]   That brings him to the end of chapter two.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.980]   Then at the beginning of chapter three, he takes up an objection.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.980]   What advantage then have the Jews?
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.500]   See, there it is, the question.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.540]   If, said the Jew, and they said it very vociferously, as I'm saying at that time, they said, "If
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.580]   what you are saying is right, well then what advantage have the Jews?
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.340]   Or what profit is there of circumcision?"
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.500]   He digresses to deal with the objection and the difficulty in the argument, and he goes
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.580]   on dealing with it until the end of verse twenty in that third chapter.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.420]   Then having done that, he comes back again in verse twenty-one of chapter three, and
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.660]   again gives an amazing exposition of his doctrine.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.060]   But still you see, he knows that people are not quite happy about this.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.140]   He knows that this doctrine of justification by faith, which he's been laying down there,
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.660]   seems to cut across everything that everybody believed, always about the Jews.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.780]   That the Jews were God's people because they were circumcised, and because they kept the
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.780]   law.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.740]   And the Gentiles were not circumcised, and they didn't have the law, and they didn't
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.140]   keep the law.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.660]   So you see, he devotes chapter four, you remember, again it's a kind of digression, to answering
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.500]   that objection once and forever.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.740]   He takes the case of Abraham.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.500]   Here's the key case.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.860]   If he can prove that all he's been saying was true, even in the case of Abraham, he's
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.140]   demolished their position.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.140]   And that is what he does in chapter four, right through the whole chapter.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.940]   It's in other words, one of these sections that comes in to deal with an objection to
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.820]   the doctrine he's been laying down, he's answering and refuting an argument that is brought against
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.820]   his essential teaching.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.220]   Then, having done that, he proceeds again to draw out the main results of the doctrine
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.780]   of justification by faith.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.260]   He starts that in the first verse of chapter five, "Being therefore justified by faith,
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.140]   we have peace with God," and so on.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.780]   And he goes on working it out, you remember, in that fifth chapter.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.220]   And then immediately, again, he's up against two difficulties.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:35.540]   This teaching of his there seems to be doing two things.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.440]   It seems to be encouraging people to go on sinning.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.420]   It also seems to be putting the law of God entirely on one side.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:50.020]   So the apostle can't go on with his teaching until he has refuted and dealt with those
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.140]   two particular difficulties and objections to his teaching.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.940]   In chapter six, you remember, he takes the first one up.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.940]   What shall we say then?
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.740]   "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.740]   God forbid."
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.940]   But he doesn't leave it at that.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.380]   He works it out in detail in order to answer that.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.540]   Chapter seven, he takes up this whole question of the law.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.020]   "Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, how that the law hath dominion
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.140]   over a man as long as he liveth."
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:21.180]   Chapter seven is devoted entirely to a treatment of the functions and the purpose and the limits
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.220]   of the law, even the law of God.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.980]   As I pointed out at the time, chapters six and seven are really digressions to deal with
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.980]   difficulties.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.820]   Then in chapter eight, he comes back to the main line once more.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:40.940]   We've seen what that is, this glorious doctrine of assurance, leading eventually to the wonderful
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.660]   doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.260]   Once more, there is the difficulty.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.780]   Once more, there is this objection, the very one to which I have already referred.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.700]   And here in chapter nine, ten, and eleven, he turns aside again.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.100]   He's got to clear this matter up.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.100]   He's got to reconcile what he's been saying with the whole of the Old Testament, and that
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.540]   is what he proceeds to do.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.380]   So you see, I am arguing that he doesn't just say, "Well, now then, I've finished that.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.380]   Now what else?
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.380]   Ah, yes, yes, this question of Jew and Gentile.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.860]   I must deal with that.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.900]   That isn't it at all.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.740]   There's no break here.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.300]   It follows on inevitably.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.620]   He's got to deal with it.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.580]   People are in trouble about this.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.380]   Jews particularly were in trouble, and the apostle is concerned to win them to the truth
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.660]   and to the faith.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.380]   So in these three chapters, in this section, he takes up the challenge.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.940]   He deals with the arguments, and as is his custom, he completely and entirely demolishes
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.940]   them.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.940]   Very well.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:52.060]   I am bold to assert, therefore, that the way to describe chapters 9, 10, and 11 is not
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.820]   to say that they deal primarily, as Hodge says, with the calling of the Gentiles and
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.500]   the rejection of the Jews.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   He does deal with that, as I'll show you.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.820]   Neither is it what Hodge, what Holden tells us, that he goes on to treat with the doctrine
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.300]   of predestination.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.300]   He does deal with that, but it's a subsidiary doctrine.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.620]   What is this?
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.420]   This is what must be called a theodicy.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.620]   Now that's a good word.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.620]   Take it down.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   Theodicy.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620]   T-h-e-o-d-i-c-y.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.620]   Theodicy.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.300]   What does it mean?
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.740]   It means a justification of the ways of God.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.180]   It's a bigger subject than predestination.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.940]   It's a bigger subject even than the calling of the Gentiles and the rejection of the Jews.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.820]   It's a justification of the ways of God with respect to men.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.260]   It is an attempt at a harmony of the ways of God.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:51.300]   It is a reconciling of what God has said and revealed with what God does.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.020]   That's what this is.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:59.200]   And we mustn't allow it to be reduced to any smaller dimensions than that.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:08.300]   This section, I'm asserting then, is the apostles' way of harmonizing the Old Testament
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   with the New.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:17.060]   All that God has ever said with what God is still doing and with what God is going to
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.060]   do.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.900]   Or, if you like it in simpler language, it's this.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:29.620]   It's the apostles' way of showing us that though things seem to be contradicting God's
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   purpose, they're not doing so.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:39.020]   He's just going on with this establishing that God's purpose is absolute and that nothing
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.540]   can ever frustrate it or make him forgo it.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:49.940]   In other words, he demonstrates in these three chapters the eternal and glorious consistency
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:58.100]   of God, the consistency of God with himself, his own nature, and his own great and glorious
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.020]   purpose, his sovereignty over all.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.300]   Now, I think I can prove that I'm right in what I'm saying.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.220]   And I do so by showing you how he winds up the whole section.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.100]   This is how he finishes it in chapter 11, verses 33 to 36.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:21.740]   Having done what I'm telling you, this great theodicy, he stops and he says, "Oh, the depth
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:29.380]   of the riches, birth of the wisdom and knowledge of God, it's a bigger subject than predestination.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.300]   How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.660]   For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor, or who has first
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.860]   given to him, and it shall be reconvinced unto him again.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:47.420]   For of him and through him and to him are all things, to whom be glory forever.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.420]   Amen."
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.540]   That's altogether bigger than predestination.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.740]   Predestination is only a part of it.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:23:00.220]   And for any man to exalt predestination into the supreme position is almost to be guilty
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.220]   of blasphemy.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.860]   It's the person, the character, the being of God.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.900]   Predestination is merely one of the ways in which God works out his great purpose.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.660]   So we mustn't put this in the center as the big thing.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.660]   It isn't.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.420]   It's God himself in the glory of his person and character.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:25.740]   The climax at the end of chapter 11, at the very end of the section, I think is my final
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:34.540]   justification for suggesting that this section is primarily and essentially a theodicy.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.500]   Very well.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.540]   Having said that, I can now introduce you to the subsidiary themes in the section.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.460]   That's the one big theme.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.420]   But now there are a number of subsidiary themes, of course.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.020]   I've often compared this man's method before, haven't I, to a musical composer.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.620]   Well, here it is again, you see.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.540]   You must get hold of the great central theme, then the subsidiary, the leitmotifs, if you
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   like.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.100]   And how they're all worked in, and then he ends with the great theme itself.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.980]   Now then, what are the subsidiary themes?
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.980]   Well, here they are.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:19.940]   The particularly tragic case of the Jews as rejecters of Christ.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.260]   There's no greater tragedy than that.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.780]   And it was especially a tragedy to Paul himself, who was a Jew, and he doesn't forget to tell
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.940]   us that and to repeat it.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.420]   So we are going to deal with that.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:39.380]   We'll see him handling this whole tragedy of the Jews, rejecting his own Messiah.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.980]   That's a subsidiary theme here.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.140]   He gives us the causes of it, puts them very plainly before us.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.820]   That's number one.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:25:00.700]   Two, God's freedom in his absolute sovereignty in the matter of election, and his right to
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.260]   call whom he wills, whether Jew or Gentile.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.860]   I put it like that, you notice.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.660]   God's freedom in election.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.780]   That's the thing Paul deals with here, not with the election.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.780]   We've already dealt with that in chapter 8.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.780]   I kept you there, didn't I?
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.500]   I told you not to be in too much of a hurry to go to chapter 9.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.500]   It's in chapter 8.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.620]   He rarely deals with predestination.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.820]   All he does here is to show God's freedom in election, which is a different thing.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.860]   But that's the theme here, the subsidiary theme of God's absolute freedom in his utter
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:42.540]   absolute sovereignty to choose whom he wills, whether Jew or Gentile.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:50.060]   Then the third subsidiary theme is this one.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:26:01.780]   The vindication of this Christian teaching concerning salvation for any individual, for
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:09.060]   Gentile as well as Jew, in the light of the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.380]   Now this is the most important subsidiary theme.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.740]   You will find, as I'll show you, that the apostle keeps on doing that.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.420]   He was very sensitive on this point, and rightly so.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.460]   He was a Jew and a Pharisee and an expert in the Old Testament, and this charge always
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.860]   touched him on the quick, as it were.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   They said, "You're denying the Old Testament teaching."
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.940]   I'm not, says Paul.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.860]   I can prove to you that everything I'm teaching is there in the Old Testament.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:42.580]   So he justifies his teaching, his presentation of the Christian doctrine of salvation, in
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.620]   terms of the Old Testament teaching, and shows that the new, far from being a contradiction
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.100]   of the old, is the fulfilling of the old and the outcome of the old, something that was
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.500]   foretold in the old.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:01.580]   We use language used later by Saint Augustine.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:09.540]   The New Testament is latent in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is patent in the New
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.540]   Testament.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.740]   That's one of the subsidiary themes in this great section.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.700]   The fourth subsidiary theme is this.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.940]   The terrible danger of misunderstanding doctrine and misusing doctrine, and drawing false conclusions
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   from doctrine.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.940]   What do I mean?
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:34.720]   That was the whole trouble with the Jews.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:42.180]   They were drawing false deductions from the plain teaching of the Old Testament concerning
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.100]   the purpose of God for his people.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.340]   They were drawing false conclusions from it, and that is why they came to reject Christ.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.540]   It's a terrible danger, this.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.460]   So you see, having shown how the Jews were guilty of drawing false deductions from God's
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:07.820]   glorious doctrine, he then turns to the Gentiles and he says, "You be careful also.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.420]   If the natural branches made that mistake, you were not immune from it.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.420]   You be careful."
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:18.860]   You see, these doctrines are glorious, but at the same time, they're very dangerous.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.700]   There is this great doctrine of assurance and the final perseverance of the saints.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.860]   How many a man has argued like this from it?
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.820]   He says, "I'm a child of God, therefore it doesn't matter what I do.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.380]   Because I'm a child of God, my glorification is certain.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.380]   I can do as I like.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.380]   I'm bound to get there."
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.140]   Antinomianism.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.000]   It was rampant in the early church.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.020]   It has to be dealt with repeatedly.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.780]   People have been very guilty of it since then.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.780]   Head knowledge, you see, which makes you ignore your heart and everything else.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.420]   You say, "I'm all right, and I'm more or less at liberty to do what I please."
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.340]   Antinomianism, the greatest curse conceivable.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.420]   Now then, in this section we shall find the apostle warning us against this, the abuse
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.580]   of doctrine.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:07.060]   Drawing false deductions from God's glorious truth, even to the damnation of the soul.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.100]   That's what he's dealing with.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   He shows it in the case of the Jew, the danger in the case of the Gentile.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.820]   Subsection 5, or subsidiary theme 5.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:29.500]   He gives a very full explanation of the particular case of the Jews in the purpose of God.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.460]   That's mainly chapter 11, of course.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.380]   But there it is, I've got to put it in the list of subsidiary themes and sections.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.900]   The particular case of the Jew, why this is happening to him now, what's going to happen
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   to him.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.860]   God's purpose relative to the Jew is dealt with in detail.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.460]   And lastly, the sixth subsidiary theme is this one.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.740]   God's eternal purpose in Christ and salvation.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   With respect to the cosmos, it's inscrutable, its glorious character.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.220]   That's a theme that keeps on running right through the entire section.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:20.940]   God's eternal purpose for the whole universe, the whole cosmos.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.780]   Oh, it's inscrutable, I say.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:28.300]   Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:33.740]   How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.900]   And if you and I think or have ever thought that we understand God's mind and purpose,
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.100]   well, I hope this section will make us think again.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.300]   It isn't quite as easy and as neat and as simple as we sometimes tend to think.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:55.700]   If all this doctrine doesn't lead you to wonder and amazement and astonishment and to worship,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.380]   you haven't got it properly, my friend.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.220]   There's something wrong with your understanding of it.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:10.500]   True understanding of doctrine should always lead to adoration, to praise, and utter humbling
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.700]   ourselves in wonder before him.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.340]   Very well.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:23.580]   There then are the themes which serve to bring out this great central theodicy, which is
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.700]   the theme that covers all.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.500]   Now then, all I want to do in the remainder of our time this evening is to give you an
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:35.700]   analysis of the whole section, so that we'll be able to keep it in mind as we're working
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.300]   out in its different parts and detail.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:44.420]   Here again, one cannot but be fascinated by the Apostle's Method.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.940]   It's the most interesting section from the standpoint of structure.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:55.140]   It gives us a great insight into the great Apostle's mind.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:00.740]   Now I'm going to divide my analysis into two sections, general and detailed.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.740]   What I mean is this.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   The general point is a brief one.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:10.420]   It's very interesting to notice that he does the same thing as regards structure in the
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:17.020]   three chapters, and it justifies, therefore, the division of this matter into the chapters.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.380]   Paul didn't divide it into chapters, as you remember.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.580]   The division into chapters didn't come until about the 16th century.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.940]   But whoever did it, did it very well.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.820]   I want to try and show you that, because he saw that the Apostle does the same thing in
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.820]   the three chapters.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.980]   What is this same thing that he does?
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.020]   Well, the first thing he does is this.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:44.660]   In each of the three, he identifies himself with the Jew, and he is very careful and courteous,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.780]   and very loving in his treatment of the case of the Jews.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.340]   You'll find that in the three chapters.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:55.860]   It starts off, here it is, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.220]   me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.540]   heart, for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.460]   For my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh," chapter 10, "brethren, my heart's
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.820]   desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved, for I bear them record
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.460]   that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge," chapter 11, "I say then, have
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.780]   God cast away his people, God forbid, for I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abram,
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.780]   of the tribe of Benjamin."
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:30.020]   He identifies himself with them, they're his fellow countrymen, and he treats them in a
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.140]   very gentle manner.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.060]   That's in the three.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:41.420]   The second thing that's come into the three is elaboration of doctrine.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.540]   We've got it in the three.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.820]   The main doctrine in chapter 9 is the doctrine of predestination and election.
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:53.140]   The main doctrine in chapter 10 is the doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.900]   The main doctrine in chapter 11 is the rejection, the temporary rejection of the Jews.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.260]   So, you see, he starts with the Jews, himself involved, then a statement of doctrine.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:10.780]   The third thing which he does in the three is confirmation of his doctrine from the Scriptures.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.780]   You watch it.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:17.660]   At the end of the three chapters, he quotes the Scriptures of the Old Testament to prove
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.420]   what he has just been saying in his doctrine.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.580]   Now, it's very interesting that he should do that three times over in the three chapters.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.420]   It's a very good method.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.860]   Come to the detail.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   Chapter 9.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:34.380]   Let me just indicate to you the division.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:43.580]   Chapter 9, verses 1 to 3, introduction of the subject in personal terms, as I've just
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.580]   said.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:50.060]   Verses 4 and 5, a description of the peculiar position and case of the Jews.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.220]   It's just a description in verses 4 and 5.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:57.300]   Now then, verse 6, that's the key verse of chapter 9.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:02.660]   "Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect, for they are not all Israel,
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.260]   who are of Israel."
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.260]   That's the key.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   That's the key verse.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   Verse 6.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:17.300]   Chapter, verses 7 to 13, explanation and exposition of the key verse, and of the true meaning
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   of the term "Israel."
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:29.940]   God's word, he proves there, has had effect, and it has done what God meant it to do.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.740]   He only meant it to do a certain thing, and it has done that.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.300]   But you'll only understand that if you understand the true meaning of the term "Israel."
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.780]   That's verses 7 to 13.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:49.180]   Verses 14 to 24, objection to this as unfair.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.980]   You remember, what shall we say then?
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.860]   Is there unrighteousness with God?
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   God forbid.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.620]   Now that's a problem that arises out of what he's been saying in verses 7 to 13.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.100]   Objection to this as unfair.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:06.460]   Answer to this, showing God's right to call whomsoever he wills, even the Gentiles, which
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.660]   he brings out in verse 24.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.300]   Verses 25 to 29.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:18.100]   All this has been foretold in the Old Testament by the prophets.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.340]   It's not a new and a strange doctrine.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.860]   It had been prophesied and predicted.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.260]   That's verses 25 to 29.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.740]   Verses 30 to 33, summing up then of the position so far.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:37.940]   The position as it then was of the Gentiles being in and the Jews remaining outside.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:46.140]   Chapter 10, verses 1 to 3, introduction again of this whole case of the Jews.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.660]   He himself being involved.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.740]   Now then, this is what's interesting to me.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.380]   He gives a further statement concerning their tragic blindness.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.540]   What he's really doing in this chapter is to elaborate what he'd said in his summary
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.820]   at the end of chapter 9.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:12.300]   Chapter 10 is in a sense a minor digression to establish what he said in the summing up
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.180]   in verses 30 to 33 at the end of chapter 9.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.860]   He works it out in detail.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.020]   However, let's go into it in detail.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.380]   Verses 4 to 11, an outline of the true way of salvation.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.140]   He's showing how they'd gone astray.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.740]   They'd got a wrong view of salvation.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   He puts it like this.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.380]   He says, "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:41.140]   They," in verse 3, "being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.540]   their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.540]   They haven't understood this.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.820]   "What haven't they understood, I'll tell you," he says.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.540]   So from verse 4 to verse 11 he tells us.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.500]   It's a statement of the doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.980]   Very well, then.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.700]   He goes on to say in verses 12 to 17, "As it is salvation as the result of justification
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:08.300]   by faith, this is obviously for all, because God is the God of all.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.420]   He's not only the God of the Jews, he's the God of the Gentiles.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.940]   He's the creator of the whole universe.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:19.220]   And therefore, as it is a salvation which comes by faith as the result of hearing, it's
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.340]   as open to the Gentiles as to the Jews."
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.300]   That's what he works out in verses 12 to 17.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.220]   It's a matter of hearing and listening and believing the gospel.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.700]   Some, he says, refuse it.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.660]   That's the trouble with the Jews.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.660]   Others believe it.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.700]   That's mainly the Gentiles.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:45.180]   But again, in verses 18 to 21, he shows how that also had been predicted and prophesied
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.100]   by the Old Testament prophets.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.940]   That brings us to the last chapter, chapter 11.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:56.880]   Here again he starts in verse 1 with his statement concerning God's people, and again brings
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.320]   in himself as one of them.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:08.000]   And then makes this categorical statement that "God hath not cast away his people."
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.760]   Now that's the point.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.960]   God hath not cast away his people.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:21.520]   In verses 2 to 6, he gives us the real key in terms of doctrine to the understanding
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.920]   of this whole matter.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.760]   And the key is again something he's already hinted at, that there is a difference between
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.120]   person and person who comes under the general heading of Israel.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.000]   In other words, he introduces us to this wonderful doctrine, the biblical doctrine of the remnant,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.480]   showing how it applied even in the Old Testament times, and how it still applies.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:56.400]   That Israel as a nation is outside, but the true Israel, the remnant, is inside.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.600]   And how this division is always a matter of grace.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   That's the vital doctrine of verses 2 to 6.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.200]   Then in verse 7, he gives us what I would call again a key verse.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.800]   What then, in the light of this?
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.640]   "Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath obtained it, and
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.600]   the rest were blinded."
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.760]   You see, Israel is divided into two groups.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.280]   The elect in Israel, the rest.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.200]   The rest were blinded, the election have got it.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.160]   That's verse 7.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.840]   And in verses 8 to 24, he works that out.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.240]   That's the meaning of verses 8 to 24.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.400]   He's showing the difference between the elect and the rest, and he deals particularly with
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.640]   the rest.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:50.320]   And what he shows is that all that is true of them now has long since been foretold in
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.040]   the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.600]   He therefore goes on to explain why it has happened.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.960]   He goes on to say that it's only temporary, and he ends by giving a warning to the Gentiles,
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.200]   pointing out that if that could happen to these people, how much more can it happen
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   to them?
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   They mustn't presume, therefore.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.960]   So it's a mixture of doctrine and practical exhortation and application.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:22.600]   And in verses 25 to 32, he sums up the position as it then was in his day and generation,
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:30.840]   and proceeds to give an outline of the carrying out of God's ultimate, original, and grand
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:39.720]   purpose, which includes Gentiles and Jews, and how it is all going to end exactly and
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:47.960]   precisely as God purposed it and planned it, even before the foundation of the world.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:57.840]   And then, as I have said already, in verses 33 to 36, we have that grand final apostrophe,
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:05.400]   that burst of worship and of adoration and of praise, the marvel and the wonder of it
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:14.280]   all, and the ascription unto God and unto him alone, of all the praise and all the honour
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   and all the glory.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:22.360]   Well, now then, we've spent our evening in the general consideration of the point and
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   purport of this great section of Scripture.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.040]   It's a good way to approach it.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.080]   So often people get lost because they haven't got an overall picture.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.840]   We miss the wood because of the trees.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.040]   And those of us who are interested in particular doctrines are particularly liable to this.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.960]   The people who jump at predestination, the people who jump at the Jews and their destiny
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.200]   and all the rest of it, and the prophetic teaching.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:00.040]   How sad it is that they miss the bigger thing, the greater thing, the more glorious thing,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   this wonderful theodicy, the justification of God's ways with respect to man, and the
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:13.800]   harmonization of what God permits with what God purposes, what God allows with what God
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:22.640]   has planned, and the showing of how all things do indeed work together for good and for the
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.760]   ultimate carrying out of God's eternal purpose.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:35.080]   Well, God willing, we will then now proceed to our consideration of the details of this
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.360]   mighty argument.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   Let us pray.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:49.360]   O Lord, our God, we cannot but come before Thee to attempt to express our sense of marvel
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.360]   and of wonder and of praise.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.200]   O Lord, that Thou hast troubled about us at all and about our world.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.280]   For we know that not only are we all sinners by nature, but that the whole world has sinned
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.560]   against Thee.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:10.880]   And yet Thou didst have this great and eternal purpose before the very dawn of history and
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.720]   of time and before the very creation itself.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:23.440]   O God, we can but humble ourselves at Thy footstool and offer up our unworthy praise
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.440]   and adoration.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:32.640]   Open our eyes, we humbly pray Thee, to see more and more the wonders of Thy grace, the
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:39.040]   riches of Thy grace, the perfection of Thine eternal plan.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:47.080]   O God, by Thy Spirit we pray Thee, enable us so to see these things that we shall see
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:56.160]   our own smallness and nothingness and shall be lost before Thee in wonder, love and praise.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:04.080]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.520]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:19.160]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.200]   Amen.
