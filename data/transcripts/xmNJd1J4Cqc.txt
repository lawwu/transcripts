[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   - So a lot of athletes that I know of,
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.120]   you know, once they retire,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.840]   they kind of have sometimes like a identity crisis
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.180]   or a midlife crisis.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.080]   Did you at all deal with that?
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.080]   And kind of how did you work your way through,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.480]   you know, that time going from, you know, stardom
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160]   to kind of being away from the spotlight?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.600]   Was it hard for you at all?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.200]   - There's no doubt it's an adjustment, right?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.040]   I was fortunate.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840]   I got to play football for a long time.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.300]   Look, you're always gonna miss your teammates.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.040]   And around playoff time, Super Bowl time,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.640]   you always miss it a little bit then.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.560]   I was just grateful for the time that I had.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080]   So I guess in the second chapter,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.200]   I didn't really look for that.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.560]   You know, I didn't miss, you know,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.400]   being on the field because I was grateful
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.320]   for the time that I got to do it.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   Our kids had just maybe turned five years old at the time.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.740]   So they're getting into school.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.880]   That was a nice kind of timing
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.000]   to kind of be able to sort of dive into their lives
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.300]   and everything.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.600]   And so it's been a pretty good transition.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.840]   (hip hop music)
