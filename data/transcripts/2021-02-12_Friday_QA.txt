[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:35.780]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.540]   skills, insight, and encouragement that you need
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.700]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.220]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.180]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.020]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.940]   Today is Friday, February 12th, 2021.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.020]   And today we have a live Q&A show.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.780]   A live Q&A show wherein I open up the phones,
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.600]   you call in, talk about anything that you want.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.460]   Questions, comments, anything that you like.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.140]   I haven't done these show in a couple of weeks
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.340]   'cause it's been hard to arrange the internet.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.980]   But today I'm sitting here at my desk,
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.660]   got an internet connection, so we're able to get it going.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.340]   These shows work just like call and talk radio.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.320]   And if you would like to gain access to these shows,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.820]   to call in and discuss some topic that's on your mind,
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.860]   ask a question, talk about your situation,
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.260]   it's probably one of the best ways to,
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.180]   and cheapest ways to talk to me personally.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.460]   Just go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.540]   search on Patreon for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.100]   There you'll find all of the information
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.420]   as to how you can join me on one of these shows.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.300]   Broadcasting today from beautiful Bogota, Colombia.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.580]   And so it's fun looking out my window at Bogota.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.900]   I know that many of you right now
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.780]   are looking for places to go,
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.180]   and you're frustrated that you can't travel,
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.180]   especially most of the audience of the United States
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.140]   is, sorry, most of the audience
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.260]   of Radical Personal Finance is in the United States.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.900]   So there is a little bit of a difficulty
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.100]   if you're going back to the United States
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.280]   as to now you have to have a negative PCR test for that.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.500]   But if you're looking for a place to go,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.620]   I strongly recommend that you consider going to Colombia.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.380]   I've been coming to Colombia for many years,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780]   and I really, really like Colombia.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.480]   Bogota is a wonderful city,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.940]   right up high at a high elevation, lovely weather,
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.780]   really, really beautiful.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.100]   And Colombia is one of those places
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.660]   that's had an absolute transformation over the years.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.820]   I just picked up a new book yesterday
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.820]   called "Un Mensaje Optimista para un Mundo en Crisis,"
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.620]   a message of optimism for a world in crisis.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.420]   And it was written by Juan Manuel Santos,
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.860]   the last, the ex-president of Colombia.
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.820]   And it's really fascinating.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.060]   It's basically just an argument from him
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.340]   as to how things have gotten so much better
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.380]   in Colombia over the last 30 years.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.560]   And so if your impression or your picture of Colombia
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.020]   is that it's stuck in kind of the 1980s drug wars
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.420]   and dealing with FARC and all of that,
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.020]   most of that is in the past.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.900]   Not to say there's not still things that are different
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.380]   or things that are troubled.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.740]   Of course there are, not everywhere we live, right?
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.540]   Every country has problems,
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.380]   but it's really a wonderful place,
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.540]   and I would encourage you to check it out if you wanted to.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.420]   Hopefully, as we get back to,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.040]   coronavirus starts to become more predictable
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.720]   around the world as countries open their borders,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.180]   hopefully we'll be able to get back and do more traveling
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.820]   as we go into the next part of this year.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.560]   We begin today with Jeff in Florida.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.400]   Jeff, welcome to the show.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.860]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.780]   - Thanks, Joshua.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.900]   I am considering a new job opportunity,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.540]   and both where I'm at and the new one
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.300]   are pretty equal in terms of intangible,
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.760]   but vastly different in compensation structure.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.980]   I'd love to hear how you would think
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.700]   through the two different compensation models
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.620]   of private versus government.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.060]   I could talk about all FARC numbers if you'd like,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.980]   or we could just talk about tax advantaged accounts
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.740]   and retirement benefits.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.020]   What would be best for you to talk it through?
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.340]   - Start with the nature of the job,
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.140]   and then give us a little bit about the numbers
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.700]   and the packages that they're offering to you.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880]   - Sure, so the nature of the job
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.940]   is kind of a nonprofit administration.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.080]   The work is something I've been in for a long time,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.740]   so I know it well and I'm comfortable in both roles.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.540]   For perspective, my partner and I
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.180]   were both about six to seven years away from our FIRE goal.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.140]   I know it's a big if,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.460]   but if historical averages are present,
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.420]   and pretty decent stability in both positions.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.780]   As far as kind of the government job
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.220]   is the one I'm in right now, a little lower stress,
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.800]   maybe a little less stable,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.340]   but a really good team that we're taking part of.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.760]   The private sector one is a little more stable,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.960]   maybe slightly more stress,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   but I've been there before, so I know it well.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   And I'm uncertain of the team dynamics since I've left.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.960]   So the offers that are out there are,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.440]   the government job is this kind of step ladder,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.500]   position as normal.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.800]   It's about a hundred, I'll use round numbers,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.160]   about a hundred K compensation
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.760]   between the 401k or 403d,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.360]   but the 401k, the 457, the HSA,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   we're maxing them all out.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.320]   There's 8K into kind of a 401a plan,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.480]   but there's some strings attached
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.260]   about how that has to be invested and taken out.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.400]   It is matched by about another 8K if I vest,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.840]   no social security contributions.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.680]   And so between my partner and I
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.200]   we're saving about 80K annually on about 160K of expenses,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.520]   or salary and match.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.820]   Benefits are really great,
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.440]   eight weeks of vacation and holidays,
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.600]   four weeks of sick leave,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.400]   which multiple people with families
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.320]   have said they've taken them all.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   But you have a little less control over your,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.340]   less savings, less control over your retirement funds.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.640]   But eventually in retirement,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.560]   you get health insurance covered
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.640]   at about 5% off per year of work.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.280]   So after 20 years, you'd be free.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   I'd probably make it to where health insurance
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.840]   is about 65% off.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.680]   - Okay.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.840]   - The private sector role,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.520]   the compensation is a little better,
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.840]   would be around 130K.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.720]   There's a 401k with a 2% match, HSA.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.040]   There's a pension, it's not COLA adjusted,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.320]   but it is really well funded.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.420]   So I'm pretty confident in their security.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.920]   And the pension is basically 2.5% of your cumulative salary
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.680]   while you've worked there per year.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.120]   And then, if we were maxing all of those out
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.840]   and saving the rest to taxable,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.120]   it would mean we'd have about 40K going into taxable annually
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.960]   and about 90K saved between me and my partner
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.160]   on about 190K of salaries and matches.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.380]   The soft benefits, five weeks vacation,
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.000]   one week of holidays, or four weeks vacation,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.240]   one week of holidays, five weeks time off.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.160]   About two weeks of sick leave,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.260]   not totally sure how much people use that.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.120]   And in that one, there's just more savings,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   more control over the savings.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.660]   You were tax advantaged accounts to kind of play with
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.080]   and, but you do have the pension
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.080]   and would be paying into social security again.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.480]   But I would need to obtain healthcare in retirement
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.320]   for a family, either through the marketplace
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.520]   or just paying at cost.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.440]   And I'd probably be there for about five more years
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   and then part-time for another five.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.360]   So those are the two things.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.120]   The commutes are about the same.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.760]   The bosses, I have strong relationships with both.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.160]   Work-life balance, probably a little better
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.120]   with the government job
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.600]   and the opportunity for future positions.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.240]   Probably a little better with the private job.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.600]   So--
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   - Do you have children?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.400]   - And just to, we do, two kids.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.240]   - And how old?
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   - One is a little over two
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.720]   and the other one is a little under one.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.880]   - And on your current plan, if things go as you,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   as they are expected to go,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.240]   and if you do become financially independent in 67 years,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   do you see yourself stopping employment
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.460]   at that point in time?
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.400]   - Yeah, we would, we're, our family's very interested
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.760]   in long-term travel, kind of slow travel.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.480]   You know, Columbia sounds lovely, I hear.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.640]   And so that'd be one option.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.560]   Also just, we've considered the possibility
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.840]   of potentially kind of negotiating down to where,
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.520]   and it'd be very easy in the roles I'm in
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.480]   to negotiate towards only working
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.600]   while the kids are in school
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   and being more present outside of that
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.880]   and kind of using the time off
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.920]   or going 50% three quarters time
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   and having summers largely available.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.120]   But the long-term travel is kind of the big one
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.360]   or downshifting into some careers
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.920]   that are maybe more combinations of life passions
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.200]   as well as some extra side income.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.580]   - Do you see yourself as an aggressive career builder?
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.920]   Meaning if you took the private sector job,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.280]   would you see yourself going and applying
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   for another bigger private sector job
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.460]   two and a half years from now
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.840]   where you'd be making $200,000 a year or 250
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.800]   because of your excellent results
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   at this current opportunity?
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.320]   - Probably not at one point in my life.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.960]   That's definitely kind of how I got
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.320]   into the role that I'm in now.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   But with the family coming on board,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.680]   priorities have shifted much more
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.240]   towards being present to the family.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.680]   And also just the relationships I built,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.640]   as I mentioned, I'd be returning to the nonprofit.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.000]   So I have some really strong relationships
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.280]   and in many ways there's been a long-term plan
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.760]   for me to be there.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   It would be that I'd stick around for a while
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.760]   both out of gratitude and loyalty
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.600]   and also personal family circumstance.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.760]   - Based upon what you're describing,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.720]   I think to me the favor,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.160]   the weight falls on the government job
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.080]   as being probably a better option for you.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.520]   And here is what I'm thinking
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.200]   and as far as how I get there.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.440]   First of all, it sounds like both of these jobs
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.560]   are a good fit for you.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.160]   If one was clearly not a good fit for you,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.600]   if you were gonna go crazy
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   and just be bored out of your mind in the government job,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.960]   but in the private sector job, you would love it.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.280]   Well, then that would be obvious.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.960]   But it sounds like both of these are a good fit.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.200]   You said you have a good relationship
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.820]   with both of your potential bosses, et cetera.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.440]   You can't, in my mind, it seems inarguable
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.720]   that government jobs are generally going
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.840]   to be far less stress and require less of you
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.420]   in terms of mental commitment and mental stress.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.980]   When you work for the government,
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.560]   you have a certain set of expectations.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.720]   But because of the nature of bureaucracy,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.840]   it's very hard for you to be fired
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.400]   and it's very hard for the government
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.160]   to impose upon you lots of excessive demands.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   So you're expected to be there at nine o'clock,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.280]   great, you're there at nine o'clock,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.680]   but you can leave at five o'clock.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.400]   And if the work's not done in a government position,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.520]   you just simply say, well, we're the government, right?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.000]   They have to accept what we say,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.560]   the work will get done next week.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.440]   And this leads to a very clear ability for you
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   to segment your work life and your personal life.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.200]   In the private sector, that's much less common, right?
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.020]   In the private sector, there's much more of an expectation
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.520]   that whatever it takes, we get the work done.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.400]   And this would be why most of us
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.800]   who work in the private sector, we tend to work more.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.600]   We tend to feel more pressure
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.720]   and there's the pressure of the free market upon us
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.320]   to cause us to perform.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.960]   That pressure is probably a little bit,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.580]   that pressure is less intense in the not-for-profit sector,
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.920]   but I think there's still a difference.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.440]   And when you compare the benefits across the board,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.060]   especially the benefits that are important to you
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.160]   as an early retiree, to me,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.600]   the government job sounds a whole lot better.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   It's not a bad compensation rate.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.880]   You have access to a number of different plans
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.280]   that will help you with everything.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.880]   The eight weeks of vacation and holiday leave,
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.560]   to me, is probably a much more livable thing
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.840]   for you long-term.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.220]   If you've got eight weeks of vacation per year,
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.680]   plus four weeks of sick leave,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.800]   then with having young children,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.060]   that means that you can do almost anything
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.480]   that you wanna do and still keep working.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.360]   So to me, I think the pressure for you
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.920]   to actually quit working in six or seven years
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.720]   would be much lower in that kind of system.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.860]   I mean, I like to travel for long-term.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.920]   Two months of travel per year is a lot of travel.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.520]   It's a lot of travel.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.080]   So that kind of job is probably much more livable for you
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.800]   for an extended period of time,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.740]   and that might mean that you might choose
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.080]   not to quit working in six years or seven years.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.520]   Might mean that you're comfortable enough
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.200]   that you do it for 10 years or 15 years
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   or something like that.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.840]   That's gonna be a cushy, cushy job.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.040]   And as long as the work is a decent fit for you,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.240]   you can go to work, you can work your expected hours,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.760]   you can deliver as your bosses expect,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.360]   you can go home with a clear conscience
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.120]   and just not worry about it.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.360]   And then from the perspective of early retirement,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.840]   the discounted health insurance
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.100]   is a very, very valuable perk.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.300]   It's one of the most difficult things to handle
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.000]   in the US-American system for early retirees.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.800]   And so, especially given that you see yourself
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.240]   as the kind of person who would actually stop working
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.600]   in six or seven years,
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.280]   I think having some discount
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.200]   on the health insurance system would be good.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   And then finally, my final comment is this.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.280]   Going from the government sector into the private sector
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.440]   or into the not-for-profit sector,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.680]   I think is generally gonna be an easier transition
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.160]   than going from the private sector
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.480]   into the government sector.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.760]   I can't prove that, it just feels that way to me.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.280]   And especially when I think about doing things
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.520]   like part-time work,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.080]   if you work for the government for the next six years
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.400]   and then you decide to stop working full-time,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.760]   but you wanna pick up a part-time job,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.280]   you'll have your contacts
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.520]   and your connections inside the government,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.240]   and that will be very employable
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.080]   to somebody in the private market.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.880]   You can be a lobbyist of sorts,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.480]   or you can be a consultant.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.840]   And so those kinds of things
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.400]   would lend themselves very well to a part-time job
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.860]   in the private sector
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.920]   because of the strength of your government resume.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.360]   So from what you're describing,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.920]   those are my reasons I think the weight falls
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.560]   in favor of the government job from what you're saying.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.120]   - Great, thank you.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.240]   Yeah, it's been helpful to think through that.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.520]   And the big thing for me,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.800]   I agree with your assessment,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.520]   is kind of wondering about the benefits
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.000]   of taxable funds invested
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   versus manipulating various tax-advantaged funds.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.800]   But it feels like I have some flexibility with both.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.560]   - Remember that your investment portfolio,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.240]   your investment choices are not entirely tied
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   to the system.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   So I don't think there's that.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.360]   From what you described,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.720]   there is some benefit to the pension,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.240]   but in that kind of pension program,
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.480]   if you want to create that kind of pension program yourself,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.720]   you can.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.240]   That's gonna be a commercial annuity
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.800]   that's funding that particular pension program,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.760]   and it's just gonna be an overall part of your compensation.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.320]   When you're, the health insurance,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.160]   that's a genuinely valuable business,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.720]   but you can still do most of the other stuff.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.040]   You don't have to have an HSA at work
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.840]   to be able to contribute to an HSA.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.080]   You just need a high-deductible health plan.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.320]   You can still do lots of other investing.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.040]   And with having a salary,
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.160]   you could buy five rental houses in the next five years
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.000]   if you wanted to,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.460]   just by leveraging your stable government salary
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.680]   to borrow money, buy a house, move into it,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.080]   do the old nomad strategy for five years,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.320]   and now you have a giant real estate portfolio.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.960]   So I think you can handle the money in an intelligent way.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.480]   To me, the lifestyle that you described
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.240]   of having eight weeks of paid vacation
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.320]   plus four weeks of sick leave,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.880]   that's gonna pretty much open up to you
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.440]   the vast majority of travel
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.560]   or anything that you wanna do while you're still working.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.440]   And when you also have that compounded with the fact
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.800]   that this is a nine-to-five job,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   or whatever the hours are that you're expected to work,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.220]   the point is that it's constrained to those hours,
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.600]   then you won't have a significant amount of work stress
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   with that kind of position.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.760]   You go to work, you do your job when you're there,
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.380]   you leave, if the children are sick,
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.520]   you say, "The children are sick," and you stay home.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.720]   And because of the nature of a government job,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.260]   you can do that without it messing everything up
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   and without feeling like I'm letting the whole team down
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.300]   and whatnot, which is gonna be some of the pressure
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.260]   that you'll feel in the private sector.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.120]   - Right there.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.880]   I appreciate the assessment.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.720]   - My pleasure.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.280]   - And hopefully you'll know great wisdom
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.640]   to figure out which one is best for you.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.560]   All right, let's go to Adam in Philadelphia.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.380]   Adam, welcome to the show.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.080]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.240]   - Hi, Josh.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   I hope you're doing well.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.320]   I have two questions.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.360]   I'll start with the first,
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.880]   and we can circle back to the second later.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.640]   My question has to do with taxes
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.440]   for someone with multiple citizenships,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.480]   that someone would be me.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.520]   I'm 22 years old, single.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.140]   I was born in the US to Hungarian parents,
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.400]   but I grew up in Canada.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.560]   Three citizenships, American, Hungarian, Canadian.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.840]   I went to school in Canada,
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.200]   did all my summer jobs in Canada.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.360]   I have Canadian bank accounts,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.680]   Canadian TFSA, RRSP, the whole nine.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.640]   As of January of this year, I've moved to the US.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   I'm working for a big Fortune 500 company here.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.040]   I've never paid US taxes.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.800]   I've never even filed US taxes.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.080]   I'm aware that this is something
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.560]   that I should have been doing since I started working,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.680]   although I never have.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.040]   And so I'm concerned that the IRS
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.280]   might be lurking behind the corner,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.480]   and I was hoping for your advice on how to get compliant.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.720]   I know this is something that you mentioned earlier.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.880]   - You said you're 22?
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.720]   - Yes, sir.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.880]   - Okay, so in your situation, I think it's fairly simple.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   What you need to look for is the IRS has a program.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.160]   I cannot remember the name of it right now,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.280]   and I can't search for it right at the second,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   but I'll tell you how to find it.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   So do a web search for US citizens tax compliance,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.960]   and find a tax lawyer who specializes in helping US,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:28.160]   here we go, I found it,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.440]   relief procedures for certain,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.880]   I'm looking at the IRS website,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.760]   relief procedures for certain former citizens.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.720]   No, that's not it.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.640]   So browse around on the IRS website, irs.gov,
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.680]   and find the section where they talk about the programs
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   that they have for people bringing themselves
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.760]   into tax compliance.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.800]   And again, I'm sorry, I don't remember the name of it.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   But there are, I'm finding lots of resources
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.360]   for expat tax professionals, et cetera,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.760]   and there are lawyers who specialize in this.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.400]   And so what you will do is you will contact the IRS,
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.120]   and you will say, I'm 22 years old,
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.600]   I didn't know that I was supposed to be filing taxes,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.120]   I have a limited work history,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.440]   and I'd like to bring myself into compliance.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.520]   They have a number of amnesty programs
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.120]   that you can participate in.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.440]   And those amnesty programs will allow you
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.320]   to file tax returns for the previous years
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.660]   when you were not compliant,
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.520]   and then to be free of your legal burden
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.480]   of having been non-compliant.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.860]   And in your situation,
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.360]   this should be a relatively easy and simple thing.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.560]   You probably weren't making much money,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   you're 22 years old, et cetera.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   And you'll go ahead, so you'll create tax returns
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.120]   for the years in which you were liable to file them,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.400]   for the years in which your income
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.840]   has exceeded the filing threshold
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.560]   of whatever it is, $7,000, $10,000-ish,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.520]   which probably isn't very many years.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.440]   You'll create those tax returns,
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   but you will be eligible
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.520]   for the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.760]   because you were living outside the United States,
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.920]   and thus you will owe no tax.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.480]   So your only costs will simply be any legal fees
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.160]   that you would incur to have a lawyer and accountant
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.680]   help you with filing for that amnesty program.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.600]   And that's what I would do.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.400]   So if you have the money to go ahead and start paying,
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   I can't imagine your situation,
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.800]   it would be more than a couple thousand dollars
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.680]   of legal fees, but I would go ahead.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.560]   You may be able to do it yourself, I don't know.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.400]   I wouldn't.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.680]   I would wait until I had the money
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.600]   and go ahead and use an attorney as the go-between
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.800]   and find an attorney who has done,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   who has helped people to bring people into tax compliance.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.960]   But that's how you do it,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.840]   is you just simply, you'll file the returns
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.440]   for the years that you didn't file.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.120]   So you'll grab whatever information you have
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:55.000]   from your previous work,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.840]   from your Canadian tax returns,
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.040]   wherever you previously filed,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.920]   and then you'll go ahead and file those returns.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.280]   But because you were outside of the country
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.560]   and assuming that you weren't making
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.640]   hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.000]   you won't actually owe any tax.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.240]   You have to bring yourself into compliance that way.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.800]   - Perfect, and then I guess the follow-up to that,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.000]   and maybe it's better for the tax lawyers,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.840]   but going forward, is there anything special I need to do
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.400]   to ensure that the Canadian Revenue Agency
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.880]   doesn't come after me when I'm working in the US,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.240]   being paid in US dollars?
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.000]   - Yeah, so this is not that difficult.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.440]   But the biggest thing you want to do
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.560]   is become Canadian non-tax resident
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.840]   in order to eliminate your filing requirements.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.080]   So, Canada and the United States
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.840]   have an excellent tax treaty,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.440]   and working in the United States
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.880]   and living in the United States,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.540]   you can minimize your taxes through that tax treaty.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.480]   However, since you're now living in the United States,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.500]   unless you have some compelling reason
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.640]   to maintain your residential ties with Canada,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.040]   you would just simply want
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.000]   to become Canadian non-tax resident.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.720]   So, the non-residence comes down to the basic facts of life,
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.280]   the fact that you're living now in the United States,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.680]   not in Canada.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.060]   You don't have any significant residential ties.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.280]   You're staying, most of the time, in the United States.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.800]   What you should look at is just simply look and say,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.140]   do I have any other significant connections to Canada?
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.440]   So, do I have my RRSP?
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.000]   What should I do with that?
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.280]   And the other things, and look at them.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   Do you think that your time in the United States
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.160]   is gonna be for a long time,
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.040]   or is it a fairly short time?
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:39.880]   What do you think?
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.360]   - So, the work contract I'm on now
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.160]   is gonna take me for about three and a half years.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.680]   I'll probably bounce around a couple different states
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.920]   while I'm there, and given all three of my citizenships,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.360]   I also might spend some time in Europe.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.480]   I'm not sure if I'll ever come back to Canada,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.360]   although I'm 22 years old and single,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.240]   so everything's kind of, I'm open
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.560]   to just about anything at this point.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.720]   - How much money do you have saved in,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.020]   how much money do you have saved
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.120]   in your retirement plans in Canada right now?
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.960]   - Very little.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.320]   I have a couple grand in the TFSA,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.160]   and then I have $150 in the RRSP
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.920]   that was just put in there to open it,
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.520]   and for me to feel financially responsible at 16
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.760]   that I'm saving for retirement,
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.080]   but not much has been put in there.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.840]   If I were in your shoes, I would go ahead
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.400]   and just simply cash those assets out
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.700]   and sever all of my financial ties with Canada.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.540]   I don't think it's strictly necessary.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.400]   If you had a lot of money in those accounts,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.420]   I wouldn't say it's necessary,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.860]   but right now, the cost for you of ending those plans
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.160]   will be next to nothing, assuming,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.440]   I have the impression that your income
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.160]   is probably not super high, being 22 years old,
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.560]   and just kind of just starting on your work life,
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.920]   so I would just go ahead and cash those out
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.300]   and end my financial connections with Canada.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.080]   That way, in the future, you can maintain the benefits.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.480]   You can always move to Canada,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.640]   but by becoming fully Canadian non-tax resident
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.320]   and having no ties to the country,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.960]   you don't own any real estate there,
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.840]   I would just go ahead and end my retirement plans there.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.000]   If you wanna keep one bank account, that's probably okay.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.760]   If you were wealthy, I would say no bank accounts,
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.200]   no credit cards, but since you're just
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.520]   getting started, it's probably fine
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.600]   for you to have a bank account there.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.800]   If it were me, I would go ahead and just fully extricate
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.280]   myself from the Canadian tax system.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.860]   You're gonna be in the US tax system,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.200]   but that way, you're only dealing with one system,
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.120]   and then if, in the future, you wanna go to Canada,
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.260]   you can always go to Canada,
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.520]   become resident and tax resident again,
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.440]   but this way, your tax obligations will be simple,
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.280]   and as a US citizen now, you would have
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.840]   the ability to travel, you would have the ability
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   to do everything with just the US American system,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.800]   and because of the way that the US American system works,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.040]   you can keep your entire financial infrastructure
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.280]   in the United States, you have good banking,
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.320]   better banking, lower cost, lower cost investing
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.540]   in the United States than in Canada,
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.480]   and so you can keep your entire infrastructure
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.960]   in the United States and/or choose some other countries
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.560]   that you don't have citizenship in
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.760]   to expand your banking into, but then,
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.880]   if you're outside of the United States,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.400]   then you could qualify for the relevant,
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.140]   you know, the foreign earned income exclusion, et cetera,
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.720]   for the United States, so if it were me,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.240]   I would extricate myself from the CRA.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   I think the IRS is probably easier to work with
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.920]   than the CRA, and certainly, the United States
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.580]   is probably most Canadians' best tax haven.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.800]   There's a really good book that I recommend
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.840]   by Robert Keats, which is called
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   "Why the United States is," I can't remember
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.840]   the exact title of it, but it's
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.960]   "A Canadian's Best Tax Haven, the United States,"
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.800]   and he makes a strong argument that for most Canadians,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.600]   the very best, most useful tax haven
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.760]   that they can move their life to
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.480]   in the beginning is the United States,
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.780]   so that's what I would do.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.840]   - Perfect, that sounds great for now.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   I'll stay on the call if you have time for me at the end.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.320]   Great, if not, then we'll talk later.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.660]   - Okay, great. - Thank you so much.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.500]   - All right, move on to Trey in Texas.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.340]   Trey, welcome to the show.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.520]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.000]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.640]   I wanted to ask you about inflation
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.560]   and how concerned I should be
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.740]   about inflation in the United States.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.760]   Obviously, we're creating a lot of money.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.720]   I saw a stat the other day.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.780]   I don't know if it's true or not,
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:30.440]   but it was 40% of the US dollars that are in existence
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.360]   right now have been created in the last 12 months.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.040]   I don't know if it's that extreme or not, but it's a lot.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.680]   So I've got a couple of hundred thousand dollars in cash
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   that I was saving to buy some property,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.160]   multifamily property sometime in the next one to five years
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.960]   or just whenever the right deal presents itself.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   Do you have any suggestions on how to protect that
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.860]   in the meantime?
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.240]   - Is the cash in a bank account?
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.660]   - Yes, sir, mostly.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.660]   - So my first suggestion, and this is across the board,
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.560]   is that everybody be prepared
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.820]   and have what I call a tunnel set up
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.500]   to be able to protect their assets.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.320]   So the previous caller was from Canada.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.440]   So what I routinely recommend to people
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.120]   is that I think everybody should have
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.360]   at least one offshore bank account.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.840]   And I usually recommend to most US Americans
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   who aren't accustomed and comfortable
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.000]   getting on an airplane and flying
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.480]   to the other side of the world often,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.240]   go to Canada and open a bank account.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.560]   It's easy to do.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.120]   You don't need any kind of residency in Canada.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.800]   You don't need anything except to be able
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.000]   to physically go there to open the account.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.920]   And that's obviously a problem right now
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.600]   because the Canadian border is closed
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.280]   and they have extremely strict
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.260]   and stringent quarantine requirements now,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.400]   even for Canadian citizens returning to Canada.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.440]   So it is a problem right now.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.360]   But as soon as you can, go to Canada or to some other place,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.520]   we'll cut to that in a moment,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.480]   and simply open a bank account.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.640]   Now, when you do that, what do I recommend?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.120]   Well, I tell people go and open a US dollar bank account
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.520]   and open a Canadian dollar bank account.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.680]   Why?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.400]   I don't think that you should,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   if you're saving money to buy assets in the United States,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.080]   then I think you should keep your money in US dollars.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.980]   Right now, the US dollar has weakened significantly
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.360]   over the past few months,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.440]   and it's probably going to continue to weaken.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.280]   Many analysts believe that it's gonna continue to weaken,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.160]   especially with the monetary creation
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.200]   that we see right now.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.560]   And so I expect the US dollar to continue to weaken.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.600]   But when you are living and working
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.840]   and investing in a dollar economy,
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.900]   that's not necessarily a problem.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.080]   And I don't think that most people
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.720]   should all of a sudden become Forex traders
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.520]   trying to predict, well, if I go ahead
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.040]   and move my US dollars into Swiss francs today,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.200]   then I'll go ahead and convert them out of Swiss francs
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.920]   three months from now to buy my real estate.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.280]   Maybe some people can do it.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.280]   I think it's a little bit too complex for most people.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.200]   But what I recommend is very simple.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.840]   If you will open a tunnel account
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.280]   with an offshore bank account,
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.080]   and open one in US dollars,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.860]   and open an account in Canadian dollars,
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.320]   now you have the ability to get your money out
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.160]   if you need to.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.200]   So how does this work?
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   Six months ago, when we were right
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   in the midst of, I guess it was eight months ago or so,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.880]   in about March and April of 2020,
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.000]   when everything was looking pretty black,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.700]   stock markets were dumping off,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.480]   we didn't know how severe the coronavirus pandemic would be,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   we didn't know what exactly the economic fallout would be,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   the US budget is cratering, et cetera,
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.560]   I got extremely nervous about banking stability.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.560]   And I got extremely nervous about the US dollar stability.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.600]   I don't, I believe that the US dollar is very strong
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.160]   and that it's very unlikely
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.980]   that we're going to face kind of a novel,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.840]   the kind of thing that you would write in a novel
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.520]   about a hyperinflation environment.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.200]   I think it's very unlikely.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.800]   But I acknowledge that it's possible.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.060]   And so I'm looking for ways that I can protect myself
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.120]   with minimal risk.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.540]   And so what I advised clients to do at that time
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.520]   was move money from the United States,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   move money from your US dollar account
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.920]   to a US dollar account with an offshore bank.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.000]   In keeping your money in US dollars,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.040]   you're not taking any currency risk.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.440]   You're not making a bet on currency,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.800]   you're just keeping your money in US dollars.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.680]   You're just moving it from a US bank into an offshore bank.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.400]   Now, if you do start to see
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.520]   significant levels of inflation,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.080]   your money is already outside of the country,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.820]   which can help you to protect
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.720]   against likely capital controls.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.860]   When governments face economic instability,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.260]   they start to impose significant capital controls
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.300]   and currency controls.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.620]   They make it illegal for you to change your money
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.540]   out of the failing currency into a foreign currency.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.700]   So you're protected from that
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.540]   by moving your money into an offshore bank.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.100]   And now the transaction can be easily accomplished.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.100]   If you have $200,000 in US dollars at your Canadian bank,
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.120]   then you can just simply,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.640]   with one click of a button on the website,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.120]   move your $200,000 from your US bank,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.280]   your US dollar account to your Canadian dollar account
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.840]   at the current exchange rate,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.440]   thus freezing your exposure to US dollars.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.080]   So that's the simplest, lowest risk plan
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.280]   that I've ever come up with.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.600]   Create an account offshore,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   create a tunnel account for US dollars,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.800]   and you have to have it set up in advance.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.760]   You have to have it set up
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.920]   so that you can wire money back and forth.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.600]   And you should go ahead and wire money back and forth
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.120]   so that your banks get used to the fact
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.800]   that you transfer money back and forth.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.840]   But you don't have to take any currency risk.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.800]   You just simply need to have the US dollar account offshore,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   and then you can go ahead
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.680]   and convert it to a foreign currency.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.480]   For this scenario, almost any foreign currency is fine.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   It really doesn't matter significantly what currency it is.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.020]   Obviously, there are good reasons to choose
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.820]   one of the stronger currencies,
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.520]   Euro account, Swiss franc account,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.920]   Canadian account, et cetera.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.100]   The point is, however,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.360]   you wanna have your money outside of the country,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   and you wanna be able with a click of the button
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   on your computer to convert it to a foreign currency
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.200]   that's not going to be experiencing as much inflation.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.440]   And then from there, if the facts in the future warrant,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.800]   and you recognize, all right,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.280]   I'm moving into Canadian dollars right now
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.760]   'cause there's massive inflation in the United States,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.000]   but I don't wanna stay in Canadian dollars
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.360]   because there might be Canadian inflation in Canada then.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.840]   Well, at least you're out of the country.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.540]   You can go ahead and now move into a Euro account
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.800]   or whatever seems to be the appropriate basket of currencies
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.420]   for you to hold at the time.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.440]   That's my best solution.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.420]   I acknowledge the fact that that's difficult right now
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.220]   if you don't already have those offshore accounts set up.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.260]   This is why I emphasize that the time to plan for disaster
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.500]   is long before the disaster ever happened.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.100]   Almost two years ago now,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.980]   I launched my "How to Survive and Thrive
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.500]   During the Coming Economic Crisis" course,
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.460]   and I emphasized this stuff is easy to do now.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   Two years ago, you could easily drive
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.260]   across the Canadian border
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.140]   and be welcomed into Canada and do that.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.580]   Today, you cannot get in.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.420]   So if it's not set up now,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.860]   you need to either find a country
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.180]   that you can bank in right now and set up an account there.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.780]   This is more difficult than you might imagine
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.940]   because many countries do not have a system
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.060]   where they simply allow tourists to come in and bank.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   Canada does.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.620]   There are other countries that do,
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.540]   but many, many countries require you
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.180]   to have a residence permit
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.100]   or have some significant ties to the country.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.140]   Many countries get nervous about people coming in
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.140]   and wanting to have bank accounts
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.060]   if they don't have ties to the country.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.220]   So you can try another offshore jurisdiction,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.940]   or what I would just say is
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.700]   I wouldn't worry too much about it.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:08.100]   While I think that that kind of planning is important,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.340]   I'm still not in the hardcore,
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.740]   I don't see significant signs of inflation.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.540]   I do see the Federal Reserve creating money,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.020]   but compared to where things could be,
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.900]   I don't think it's that big of a risk right now.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.500]   So your kind of other backup plan,
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.820]   if you don't do go the offshore banking route,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.260]   is just simply keep your eye on the markets
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.660]   and then think about what kind of commodities
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:38.460]   could I move into if I needed to.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.580]   So let's say that I did start to see
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.540]   significant levels of inflation.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.500]   What could I do with that?
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.340]   What would I buy?
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.340]   Would I buy, you would generally buy some kind of hard asset.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.500]   A monetary asset is ideal, but would you buy Bitcoin?
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.460]   Would you buy gold?
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.340]   Would you buy tools?
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.060]   There are lots of things that you could buy
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.220]   to protect your money if you got into that system.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.220]   I don't think the hyperinflationary scenario is likely.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.460]   I think in the future,
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.500]   some kind of mass inflation scenario,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.180]   like a 1970s, 8%, 10%,
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.500]   I think that kind of thing is possible.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.780]   Probable, I don't know, right?
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.380]   Possible to probable somewhere in that range.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.060]   But I think that in that scale,
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.340]   I don't think that that level of inflation
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.620]   is the kind of level where you would just
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.020]   all of a sudden go out and buy gold, right?
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.940]   I think that that's a doable level of inflation
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.580]   that you would press forward with your business activities,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.180]   kind of as expected.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.540]   So that's my answer, Trey.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.100]   - That sounds great.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.500]   If you don't mind, I'd also like to hang on the call,
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.620]   and if you have time to circle back,
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.460]   I'll ask another one,
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.180]   but your answer was awesome for the inflation,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.020]   so I appreciate it.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.260]   - Cool, I'll put you on the list,
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.460]   and let's see what we got time.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.660]   John of Pennsylvania, welcome to the show.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.220]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.540]   - Hey, Joshua, thanks for taking the call.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.380]   - My pleasure.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.220]   - I was considering taking a road trip cross-country.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   I'm in the US,
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.780]   only in the spring and summer.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.460]   Since we've done so much road travel and camper travel,
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.740]   I was actually considering just doing this in hotels
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.260]   and whatnot, since I'm not set up with a pop-up
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.300]   or anything like that yet.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.740]   I was just curious of your advice on kind of
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:28.380]   both pacing, duration, places to go that were your favorite
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.260]   in the middle of the country,
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.460]   so-called flyover states,
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.460]   you know, to kind of take our time.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.020]   The only thing I know we're looking to not do
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.940]   is pack and unpack into a hotel every single day,
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.620]   so depending on the full duration of the trip
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.900]   and how far we want to go,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.500]   maybe a few days at least in each hotel,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.100]   but I'm really not sure about long-term travel trade-offs,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.580]   and if there's any advice you have on that
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.180]   or any thoughts you have on that I could use.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.300]   You have, I think, two children, right?
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.340]   And how old are they?
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.060]   - Yeah, two children.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.740]   The boys are five and seven.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.240]   - Five and seven, okay.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.860]   So I'll give you my thoughts on this
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.180]   from having done both of the above, all of the above.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.180]   I generally, from a financial analysis perspective,
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.500]   I don't believe that RV camping saves most people money.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.980]   If you're going on trips for two weeks of annual vacation,
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.900]   three weeks of annual vacation,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.060]   many people buy a camper and they think that,
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.060]   well, if I have this camper,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.700]   I'm gonna save lots of money
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.380]   going camping for two weeks a year.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.500]   It doesn't happen, in my opinion,
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.180]   because campers experience such massive depreciation
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.140]   and there's so many expenses associated with camping
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.060]   of buying a vehicle that can tow a trailer,
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.460]   buying a trailer, buying all the stuff for it,
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.180]   fixing the thing when it's broken,
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.700]   paying the campground expenses, et cetera,
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.720]   that I don't argue to people
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   that camping is a financially efficient thing to do
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.180]   if they're going on two or three weeks of trips a year.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.780]   I think that if you're gonna travel for two or three weeks,
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.820]   you can go to nice resorts if you like that and do it.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.840]   What I do argue is that camping with children
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.980]   is, in my opinion, a really, really ideal way
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.180]   for a family to travel.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.380]   I don't like going to hotels with my children
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.420]   because there's generally nothing to do
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.780]   in the hotel room that's productive.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.740]   And so you go to a hotel room
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.600]   with a five-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.860]   you go, even if it's a nice hotel,
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.460]   you have the amenities of the hotel,
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.660]   hopefully they have a pool,
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:47.600]   maybe they have some kind of other games and things to do,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.440]   and then you have your room.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.540]   And what do you have to do in a room?
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.900]   Well, you have a TV,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.020]   you have their books,
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.540]   you have their games, their digital games,
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.000]   their tablets or whatever you're doing,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.300]   but there's not much to do.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.820]   There's not a lot of things where children can play.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.180]   And so you can't generally allow your children
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.920]   just to go play unsupervised in the hotel.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.820]   And so I find traveling in hotels
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.020]   with children pretty stressful.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.940]   It's not stressful if you go to a resort
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.240]   and you have a lot of activities there.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.500]   But just kind of a standard hotel,
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.640]   I find it pretty stressful
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.560]   because you've got this little itty-bitty room,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:28.300]   you've got one or two chairs, it's no fun.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.660]   Now, when I compare that to camping in RV parks,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.940]   national parks, state parks, et cetera,
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.500]   I find the situation totally different.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.420]   Because if I take a camper into a state park
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.180]   or an RV park or something like that,
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.220]   then now I've got a big, beautiful outside
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.380]   where it's expected that my children can run around
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.860]   and generally speaking,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.100]   with a five-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.620]   generally speaking,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.700]   most campgrounds are contained enough
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.780]   where you could feel confident
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.460]   about sending them to the playground.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.680]   Or they can feel confident about having,
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.220]   riding around the camping loop.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.340]   If you bring a couple of bikes, some scooters,
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.380]   some bicycles, you can send your children outside
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.180]   and they can play very happily and very safely outside
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.220]   for two hours straight,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.860]   just riding their bicycles around the loop
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.460]   and poking around in the woods
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.940]   and catching spiders and whatever it is that children do.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.860]   And there's often other children in the campground,
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.980]   which means that often they can have the chance
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.140]   to play with other children
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.660]   in a more, an easier way than hotels.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.340]   And so I would be willing to spend more money
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.020]   going and camping
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.060]   because it makes for a better environment for me.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.740]   You don't just have to sit down in front of the TV
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.420]   and turn on a movie to figure out what to do
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.360]   and how to keep these children
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.860]   from going crazy in the hotel room
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.960]   when they're full of boundless energy.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.460]   You can just say, "Go outside,
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.900]   I'll call you when it's time for dinner."
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.300]   And then you look out the window,
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.900]   you poke, you peek your nose around,
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.860]   you set some boundaries
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.980]   and generally I think they have more fun.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.020]   In addition, camping often has lots of work
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.460]   associated with it that children can help with.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.820]   So the work of setting up a fire, right?
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.740]   It's really fun for children to have a fire.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.020]   And so now all of a sudden,
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.460]   you have a really healthy evening's entertainment
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.460]   where you, at 5.30, you get some firewood,
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.300]   you build the fire.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   Of course, that's hard to do 'cause the wood is wet,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.660]   so it takes you 50 minutes to get a fire going,
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.460]   but you teach your children how to build a fire,
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.260]   then they can happily sit and watch the fire
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.140]   and poke it and burn sticks in the fire.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.220]   Then you have dinner,
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.060]   then you have marshmallows and s'mores,
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.540]   and then y'all just sit around the fire
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.100]   and stare at it and talk to each other.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.020]   And so it creates this really healthy environment
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.860]   where you have time with your children,
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.900]   time to spend with them, time to talk to them,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.580]   instead of sitting around a little itty-bitty table
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.300]   in a hotel room wondering what do we do now, right?
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.340]   It's just very different in that sense.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.740]   Similarly, there's other work.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.380]   Again, the work is you can say to the children,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.380]   "Go into the woods there and collect dead sticks
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.060]   "on the ground so that we can burn them."
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.260]   Well, there's an hour and a half to keep them busy
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.220]   while you and your wife make dinner.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.660]   You can say, "Let's wash dishes," right?
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.820]   "We gotta wash the dishes."
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.660]   So you can easily put the dish pans on the picnic table.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.260]   Now all of the things that are annoying at home
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.820]   when they start having water fights
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.020]   and blowing bubbles and everything,
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.540]   well, you got time and it's not a big deal
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.340]   if the water spills on the picnic table.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:29.340]   So I prefer camping because of the lifestyle.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.500]   The other thing of the lifestyle that I really appreciate
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.820]   is the lack of stress,
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.180]   and especially the lack of financial stress.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.240]   In the United States, hotels are generally very expensive,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.580]   even for mediocre hotels.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.540]   So you can drive across the country,
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.500]   and when you're driving somewhere,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.180]   you're kind of stuck to what's available in a certain place,
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.420]   and you don't know where you're going to be.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.820]   And so I drove across the country last year,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.100]   and I was with a friend of mine,
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.500]   and we're driving across the country,
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.380]   and we're just two adult men driving across the country,
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.820]   and we're driving hard
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.340]   'cause we were making progress across, we had a goal,
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.440]   but we had to pull in, and I'm finding myself stuck
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.640]   paying $100 a night for this dirty motel
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.060]   in the middle of Texas because that's what's there,
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.520]   and I don't want to drive for another two hours
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.840]   to try to find something else.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.180]   And so you're kind of stuck with what's available,
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.480]   and it really bugs me to pay $105 a night
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   for a dirty hotel in the middle of Texas.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.960]   I don't like staying in those places,
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.880]   and I feel like I'm wasting money.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.820]   And so now with children now, it becomes even worse
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.040]   because at least my friend and I, we're both adults,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   we can keep going, but you can't press your children
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.840]   that hard when you're road tripping.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.880]   You get to the point where they're done,
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.880]   and you want to get out of the car and do something.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.140]   And so you pull up to some random hotel somewhere
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.080]   that's gonna cost you 100 bucks for a junky room
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.600]   that you don't really want to touch anything in it
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.820]   because that's where you happen to be,
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.800]   and now there's nothing to do.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.960]   There's some tiny little swimming pool out back
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.240]   that's too cold to swim in,
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.400]   or there's too many drunk people,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.920]   really you don't want to take your children
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.420]   to that environment right now.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.320]   And so I find that stressful.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   I find it stressful to be stuck paying
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.080]   whatever is available.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.640]   However, when I have a camper,
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.200]   I find myself totally at peace
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.800]   'cause if I have a camper, not a pop-up,
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.000]   but a camper where we can sleep in,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.320]   then now I know that I can pull over anywhere,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.620]   and I can be totally fine.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.180]   If the children are done,
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.200]   I'll just pull over into a rest area,
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.840]   and we'll sleep in the rest area.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.960]   Now, there may not be that great amenities,
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.800]   but there's usually some woods,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.120]   and I can take them and find a playground,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.960]   or we can go and throw a Frisbee in the woods
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.240]   in the grass while mom gets dinner ready
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.080]   or something like that.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.840]   If we're in a bad part of town,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.000]   we just drive to a Walmart,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.200]   stay in the Walmart parking lot,
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.100]   and once they're in their beds,
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.600]   then everything is normal.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.180]   And then because they have their stuff,
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.960]   they have their bed, they have their books,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.200]   they have their things,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.680]   it's actually easier to keep them contained and settled.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.240]   We're not moving into a new hotel room
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.840]   and you just have what's in your backpack or the suitcase.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.160]   You have your bed, go, go, go away and read a book.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.840]   And so you can get some peace.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.040]   So I love the lifestyle of traveling in a camper
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.320]   with children, and it makes me really enjoy traveling
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.220]   because it's just so low, I find it extremely low stress.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:27.200]   I would pay more if it cost me more to have a camper
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   because I find it with children
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.500]   a very low stress way to travel.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.800]   Now, I don't think it actually has to cost more.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.600]   And if you're traveling for an extensive period of time,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.920]   then it does save you a lot of money.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.480]   And so I think back to my hotel example.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.740]   I think that although you can find a $39 red roof inn
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.600]   in the middle of Georgia, right off of I-75 or something,
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.960]   you can find those things out there.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.160]   Most of the time, in my experience,
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.720]   I budget for something like $100 for a hotel,
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.680]   just a standard, we're sleeping here hotel,
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.160]   not a resort, in the United States, I mean.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.080]   But I'm not gonna be surprised by $129.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.320]   That's gonna be a standard cost.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.000]   That goes pretty far if you're gonna be on the road
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.480]   for six weeks.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.360]   And it goes pretty far in terms of the costs of an RV,
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.440]   a little trailer, a drivable motor home, things like that.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.840]   So for the lifestyle reasons, I would pay more,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.280]   but I don't think you have to pay more.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.520]   I think that the RV is, for traveling with children,
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.240]   is a cheaper thing to do
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.080]   because you can control your expenses
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.760]   based upon where you stay.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.560]   If you wanna go and you wanna pay $200 a night
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.600]   to camp at Disney's Fort Wilderness
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   or to camp at a Jellystone RV park and pay $100 a night,
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.980]   that's available and you'll love it, right?
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.800]   You'll love the amenities of that.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.520]   But if you don't wanna spend any money tonight
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.600]   because you're just trying to drive across a place
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.280]   where you need to drive, the ability to pull over
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.720]   and spend the night at a rest area and pay nothing for that
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   and not have to go and eat, that's the other thing,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.120]   is preparing food is also something I find
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.840]   extremely stressful traveling without amenities.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.320]   I don't like eating at restaurants
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.020]   'cause generally you have too much food
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.720]   and it's very hard to eat healthy food
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.880]   in many of those situations.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.080]   And then the cost adds up.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.700]   When you're buying four meals at a time, three meals a day.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.680]   So you can do stuff out of a cooler and whatnot,
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   but it's so much nicer to have your own fridge,
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.520]   your own things.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.320]   So I'm trying to sell the lifestyle
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.680]   because I've experienced it.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.120]   If I were gonna do any kind of significant trip
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.080]   more than a week or two,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.720]   and if I'm gonna travel across the country with children,
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.860]   I'm gonna buy some kind of RV
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.040]   and use some kind of RV for that.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.400]   The best, if you want a no-brainer solution,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.120]   what I would tell you is if you don't have an RV,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.040]   go to Cruise America and buy one,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.760]   try a rent, rent it if you wanna try,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.160]   but buy a Cruise America former rental.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.040]   And with two children, you can easily get away
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.760]   with their 25 foot or the smaller one that they have,
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.320]   I think it's 23 foot actually.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.360]   They have a 28 foot one that they sell
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.240]   and a 23 foot one that they sell.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.680]   And it's gonna be something like $30,000,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.440]   but it'll give you a good solid class C
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.860]   that allows you to drive in it,
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.460]   has all the stuff that you need.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.600]   As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the simplest ways
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.440]   for people just to get an RV that's gonna work
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.120]   and that's gonna need what they need.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.140]   But I would personally choose the RV
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.680]   because of the lifestyle of traveling with children
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.920]   across the United States.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.440]   - Okay, yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.820]   That's great advice.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:34.000]   You wouldn't have concerns about buying a rental RV
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.280]   as far as, had a lot of drivers
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.760]   and been beat up and all that stuff.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.120]   I mean, I guess one of the reasons
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.400]   I had concerned going hotels,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.100]   I remember hearing your discussion about,
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.700]   RVs do cost a little bit more,
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.440]   but I understand your argument for,
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   I kind of sympathize with all those arguments
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   and having a slower pace and giving things to kids,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.880]   things to do.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.520]   One thing I had said I didn't wanna do is,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.020]   buy a whole new car, truck to pull a pop up or a trailer.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.040]   So, having the trailer is one cost,
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.640]   but having a whole new car that we don't need
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.480]   was another cost.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.040]   But I guess I can think about buying smart
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.280]   and reselling it when I get back and all that stuff.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.120]   But the cruise America thing is something
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.880]   I'll have to look into off the,
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.440]   once they're buying one of their old ones,
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.560]   if you think that's a good route.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.200]   - Yeah, so it's an unlimited conversation.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.960]   So I have, so I'm, to be clear,
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.920]   what I'm saying to you is regarding traveling with children.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.000]   Now, I've given the exact opposite to couples
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.080]   who were older, who didn't have young children.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.560]   And I would give the different advice,
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.760]   possibly to people who didn't, who had older children.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.840]   Right, if there was somebody who had older children,
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.760]   and maybe they were gonna do a mixture, right?
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.080]   They were gonna go ahead and have a tent
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.380]   that they were gonna use, set up tents in a national park,
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:57.160]   and also stay in hotels,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.120]   then I think that can work really well, right?
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.160]   I wouldn't be scared about that.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.640]   If I got a 12 year old and a 14 year old,
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.000]   we could load up in tents and it'd be great
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.340]   because they can do the work and they're useful.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.640]   But a five year old and a seven year old
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.280]   are very minimally useful.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.720]   And so that kind of stuff just creates a ton of work
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.720]   for you and your wife.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.000]   For an older couple who can go to a nice hotel room
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.620]   and enjoy just simply being in the hotel room,
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.840]   and they're not running around,
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.200]   needing to get their wiggles out.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.360]   And the fact whether they go to the pool or not,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.280]   like now all of a sudden,
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.920]   and then they're often comparing it to saying,
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.460]   well, either I buy a $100,000 RV,
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.800]   or we travel for six weeks a year in hotel rooms.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.040]   I think you can make a good argument
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.060]   for the hotel rooms in that situation.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.440]   But I don't enjoy being in hotel rooms with my children,
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.400]   unless it's a place where it has a resort
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.760]   and it has lots of activities,
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.920]   which is not kind of what you're describing
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.560]   traveling across the country.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.520]   So on the RV setup,
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.720]   if you're willing to deal with the hassle,
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.040]   I don't think they have to cost that much.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.280]   Your cheapest thing to do is buy a travel trailer.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.000]   And you can go down all day long and get a travel trailer
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.600]   for a used travel trailer in good condition for 15 grand.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.120]   Something in a 25 foot range, 20 with two children,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.760]   you can get away with 20 footer,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.120]   something like 20, 25 foot,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.200]   you can get those all day long for 15 grand
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.660]   that are five to nine years old.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.340]   Your maximum depreciation,
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.920]   if you kept it for a year or two,
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.480]   let's say you lose three grand,
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.280]   four grand, something like that.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.880]   That's not that much.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.340]   And I don't think you have to if you can buy smart.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.440]   If you stick with a trailer in that size range,
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.560]   something that's a 5,000 pound trailer,
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.940]   an eight, 7,000 pound trailer,
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.240]   which there's tons of them in that range.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.320]   Then if you need a car,
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   just go get a $5,000 F-150, something like that.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.800]   You can do an SUV with that size of trailer.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.440]   I wouldn't do a pilot, I would do a bigger,
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.280]   but an expedition can work, something like that.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.320]   And so I would just grab a $5,000 F-150
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.080]   and a 10 or $15,000 25 foot or 20 foot trailer,
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.040]   depending on how big you want.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.280]   And I think you're good.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.040]   And so let's say you use it for a year or two
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.120]   and you sell it,
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.920]   you'll sell the F-150 for,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.800]   if you pay eight grand for it, you'll sell it for seven.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.880]   If you buy the trailer for 12,
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.240]   you'll put $1,000, $2,000 into kipping it up
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.120]   and then you'll sell it for 10.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.360]   So when I had my rig, I did the whole thing
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.580]   and I came out basically even.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.720]   And so I think all the same principles apply.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.280]   Now, if you do the Cruise America route
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.160]   where you buy one of their rental RVs,
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.960]   I'm not concerned about buying one of their rental RVs
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.800]   because while I do believe that people have used them
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.020]   and used them hard,
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:52.320]   vehicles are made to be used.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.400]   So somebody drove their RV at 70 miles an hour
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.360]   or 75 miles an hour across the Arizona desert.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.040]   I mean, they're not, no one's joyriding an RV.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.920]   No one's spinning donuts in the parking lot.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   They're just driving fast
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.440]   and maybe pushing the gas pedal down.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.240]   The cars are built to handle that.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.640]   And then those rental RVs are built to be tough.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.440]   They're custom built for Cruise America.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.920]   They're built to be tough and they're used.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.520]   They're well used, but they're adequate.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   And so I would look at that as,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.000]   if you wanna get into a drivable RV
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.420]   where you're inside of it, it's your class C,
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:32.720]   basically it's, I can pay 30 grand for this RV
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.680]   that's a rental, it's got a hundred thousand miles on it.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.200]   It's built tough, but it's five years old.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.040]   It's got a good roof.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.520]   It's got a generator, it's got all the stuff that works.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.960]   I can probably go and sell it because it's a rental.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.320]   It's not gonna have a strong resale.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.720]   So maybe I can sell it for 23 or 24
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.120]   at some point in the future.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.860]   That's different than going and paying 65
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.160]   for a five-year-old class C.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.360]   So if you can find a good class C
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.600]   that's being sold for cheaper,
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.680]   I think you can come out better ahead
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.000]   because it doesn't have the baggage of the rental RV.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.560]   But if you want something that's just fast,
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.720]   that's a fair deal,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.980]   that you're gonna lose five grand in depreciation,
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.560]   I think the rental RV is something worth considering.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.240]   - Okay, yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.320]   That's great stuff.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.720]   And I fully agree, I mean,
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.720]   especially for keeping the kids busy and all that stuff,
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.880]   we plan to do at least a little bit of car camping,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.920]   but we may consider that, but yeah,
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.520]   just keeping them busy with the fire,
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.120]   basically what I do in the backyard anyway,
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.320]   is just want to extend that across the country.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.760]   So I think it's a good plan.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.120]   - If you're willing to do the tent,
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.320]   and with a five-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.240]   it'd be fun for them.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.160]   I think the biggest thing is
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.600]   how much work is it for your wife?
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.960]   If you're willing to do the tent,
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.060]   then I think a mixture of the two
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.480]   can also be something that you should consider.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.400]   So when I was growing up, we did this a lot.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.860]   We had a pop-up camper,
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.240]   but we didn't all fit in the pop-up camper,
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.520]   so we also had a tent.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.760]   And so what my parents would do,
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.960]   we would travel across the country.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.140]   We never traveled full-time.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.040]   Our longest trips were three and a half weeks, right?
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.080]   We went from Florida to Maine
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.360]   or from Florida to Montana, things like that.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.760]   But, and we did it in three and a half weeks, which is fast.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   But what we would do is we would go to a national park
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.160]   or a state park, and we would set up at that national park
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.120]   and that state park for several days.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.380]   And when you have a tent and you're setting things up,
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.400]   that works fine.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   And then in between, if we were in a city
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.600]   or we were just traveling, then we would stay at a hotel.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.020]   And so there were many times where we're leaving Colorado
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.640]   and we got to get to Florida in two and a half days.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.760]   Well, we're not stopping and setting up the tent
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.240]   or trying to find a nice park.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   We're just staying at one of those hotels.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   And so if you don't want to own an RV
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.360]   or you don't want to own one yet,
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.980]   then I think you could handle that.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.420]   It's just really hard to do that
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.760]   for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.680]   So if you've got enough friends that you can stay with
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.120]   or family, and that could just be one thing,
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.600]   then yeah, you don't have to buy another car,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.400]   get a nice tent, get some nice cots or whatever it is
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.200]   that makes your family comfortable.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.320]   And then just don't go too fast.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.740]   If you set up a tent and you stay somewhere
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.100]   for two or three nights, and then you travel from there,
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.260]   you do the hikes, et cetera,
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.180]   I think that's a good way to do it.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.580]   And with a five-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.080]   I think they could handle that.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:15.620]   I've got babies, and so tent camping with babies
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.700]   is a much bigger hassle 'cause they're just dirty
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.140]   all the time and it's frustrating.
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.940]   But you don't have babies anymore.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.140]   Well, thank you very much.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:28.380]   That gives me so much to kind of go on and plan out
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:31.160]   and consider the cost of all the options.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.720]   I got some homework now, so thank you.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.160]   - My pleasure.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.000]   My pleasure.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.080]   I didn't mean to cut you off, but I did.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.360]   All right, we go to Lucas in New Jersey.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.200]   Lucas, welcome to the show.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.160]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.280]   - Hey, Josh, can you hear me okay?
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.980]   - Yes, sir, sounds good.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.820]   - Okay, great.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.720]   Hey, so I had a question about HSAs.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.400]   So I'm engaged to be married.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.720]   I have two HSAs to my name from two different employers,
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.280]   and I know already that I take them with me.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.420]   That has happened, but they're still
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:05.000]   with two separate accounts.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.820]   What's the C word that you would use to describe those?
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.720]   I can't think of it.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.880]   - Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   - Anyway. - Go ahead.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.920]   - Anyway, so two separate HSAs, and my fiance has one.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.800]   And we were talking about it,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.760]   and just wanted to get some guidance
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.680]   on what we should be doing with these HSAs.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.240]   Is there any reason or ability
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.320]   that we would want to roll those into one?
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.920]   What benefits might I lose?
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.000]   And more importantly, when we do eventually get married,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   is the reimbursement length of an HSA
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.960]   only go back as far as the original account holder?
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   Because obviously, well, not obviously,
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.320]   but I'm a couple years older,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.080]   and so my HSAs tend to go back further.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.640]   So would we want to keep those
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.720]   so that we can eventually submit reimbursements
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.000]   against for them for older receipts?
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.920]   I'm trying to piecemeal how to optimize multiple HSAs
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.480]   for different age holders.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.920]   - Understood.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.760]   Are you using your HSAs in a normal way,
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.440]   as in you're putting money in them,
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.880]   and you're using them for expenses?
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.760]   Or are you using them in the aggressive,
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.600]   mad scientist, using HSA to fund your early retirement way?
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.440]   - More along the mad scientist idea
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.720]   of submitting expenses 20 years from now
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.040]   once the interest has accrued.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.240]   - Okay, got it.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.840]   So I think that you,
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.480]   I don't think you can roll over an account
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.960]   from your HSA into your wife's HSA after you're married.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.120]   I don't think that can work.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.040]   - Okay.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.480]   - If you set up a joint account,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.680]   I'm not sure you can transfer it into that.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.720]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   I don't know.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.560]   That would be, I think,
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.480]   what I would do is I would call the custodian,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.200]   I think that was the C word you were looking for.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.040]   - That is.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   - I would call the custodian and ask them that question.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:16.840]   They should know those laws enough
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.040]   to answer the question.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.920]   I don't know the answer to it.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.440]   What I would think I would do is if she has an HSA
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.160]   and I have an HSA,
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.520]   I don't see any real benefit to commingling them.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.920]   So I would just probably leave those accounts there
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.080]   as long as they're not having high expenses
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.640]   associated with maintaining those accounts.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.600]   I'd probably leave them alone
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.680]   and I would just start a new joint HSA
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.400]   because of that issue of rolling money over.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.360]   I don't know.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.280]   My guess would be that you can't roll it into her account,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.160]   but you probably could roll it into a joint account
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.040]   and then and co-mingle it later,
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.400]   but you have to ask the custodian.
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.280]   I don't know the answer.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.520]   With receipt question,
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.180]   I think this is one of those areas
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.520]   where there's the letter of the law
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.320]   and then there's what's practical.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.600]   So on the letter of the law,
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.760]   it would go back to,
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.880]   yeah, you would have your oldest account.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.000]   And so that would also would be a good reason
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.200]   if you're doing the hardcore, mad scientist,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.520]   use your HSA as a retirement account plan,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.920]   then I think keeping the original account
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.680]   with that initial inception date
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.840]   would be what you needed to do
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.760]   'cause that would give you the maximum timeline.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.520]   But I honestly think that a lot of that stuff
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.900]   will just come out in the wash.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.080]   I haven't heard stories of the IRS auditing people
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.760]   because they submitted their receipts on their HSAs.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   Now, maybe if you accumulate $200,000 in your HSA
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.120]   and then you turn 55 years old,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.340]   and then one year you submit $100,000 of receipts
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.880]   from the 1980s,
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.420]   or that was too extreme.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.440]   You're in the year 2045
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.920]   and you submit $100,000 of receipts from the year 2012,
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.140]   maybe that would get audited.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.200]   But I think a lot of that stuff
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.480]   would just come out in the wash.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.260]   Here's the receipt, here's the account,
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.960]   and how are they gonna find the records on that stuff?
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.980]   So in summary, I don't know the specific answer
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.640]   of moving it to a joint account.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.880]   My guess is yes, but ask the custodian,
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.640]   and I would probably just keep the old account
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.080]   with the initial inception date
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.980]   unless there was some compelling reason
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.440]   to move it into a joint account,
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.920]   such as lower expenses on maintaining the account,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920]   something like that.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.040]   - Okay, great, thanks.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.680]   I will talk to the custodian,
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.720]   and thank you also for the recommendation
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.640]   of The Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.040]   I've gotten it started and it's going real well so far.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:47.880]   - It's a great book.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.700]   It's one of those things
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.160]   that I think every business owner
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.560]   should have on their nightstand,
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.200]   or on the corner of their desk,
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.280]   or on the little stand next to their toilet or something,
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.280]   where they could just pick it up
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.000]   and flip through a chapter
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.440]   and then think about it with regard to their business.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.400]   I'm glad that you're finding value in it.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.240]   - Thanks a lot.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.960]   - All right, we move to, who was it?
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.760]   Uh-oh, our other's dropped off.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.800]   So Luke's listening, we'll go to Trey.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.720]   We'll go back to Trey, I think.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.400]   Trey, you had another question, go ahead.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.280]   - Yes, sir, it's another travel question.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.120]   - All right.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.160]   - It seems popular today.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:26.160]   So we are expecting our first child in August,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.480]   and I just kind of want to sanity check.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.960]   My wife works for the VA, she's a pharmacist,
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   and the federal employees have 12 weeks
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.520]   of maternity leave paid,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.120]   and then you can use up to another four weeks of sick leave.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.640]   So she's gonna be off for 16 weeks.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.720]   And I've, on your recommendation, actually,
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.160]   moved into a work-from-home scenario with my employer
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.000]   that I thought would have never been attainable
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.920]   until everything that's transpired over the last 12 months.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.400]   And so I've got that flexibility,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.480]   and I never having a baby,
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.680]   certainly never having traveled with a baby,
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.920]   would I be crazy to pick a couple of places
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.960]   and stay for maybe a month at a time in nice Airbnbs
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.640]   and just kind of use that as an opportunity
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   to explore some different areas with a newborn,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.280]   or is that just too wild?
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.240]   - I think it's very probably too wild.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.540]   I think that would be really hard on your wife.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.220]   (sighs)
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.140]   The first time around for a new mother,
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.660]   it's hard to learn to be a new mother.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.500]   It's hard.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.580]   It's a brand new set of skills.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.460]   One of the things that I have some standard speeches
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.540]   that I always give to any of our friends
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.540]   who are expecting their first baby,
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:54.540]   and one of the aspects of that is we talk about birthing.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.260]   Here's what you should know.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.100]   Here's our advice.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.980]   Here's some things, the resources that we found helpful.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.740]   Here's some ways that you can think about
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.820]   the kind of birth experience that you wanna have, et cetera,
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.300]   but one of the things that I always try to emphasize
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.300]   is that what I was underprepared for
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.220]   when I was a first-time father
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:18.220]   was the fact that the birth was only one thing
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.180]   that we needed to prepare for,
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.420]   but the time after birth was much more difficult
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.360]   than I expected.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.920]   We planned a lot for the birth,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.320]   and we were ready for what happened after the birth,
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.600]   for the new baby,
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.720]   but it was harder than I thought it would be.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.200]   So things like breastfeeding, right?
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.880]   Assuming that your wife would intend to breastfeed her baby,
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.300]   it's hard for most new mothers
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.000]   to learn how to breastfeed a baby.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.640]   It's a whole set of skills
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.440]   that they've never experienced previously
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.360]   and probably don't know,
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.800]   and so it's,
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.560]   even if you have the world's,
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.400]   so first of all,
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.140]   even if you have the world's greatest
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.520]   and smoothest childbirth,
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.600]   you have a natural vaginal birth,
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.020]   everything goes great,
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:08.840]   you have a glowing story of how smooth and easy it was,
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.120]   you still have to remember,
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.440]   and it's very important for you as a husband,
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.080]   you have to remember that childbirth
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.160]   is a traumatic medical event.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.320]   It is a serious traumatic medical event
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.000]   when everything goes well,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.680]   and so you need to,
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.400]   it's very important that you plan,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.040]   in the first couple of weeks,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.720]   to do everything for your wife
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.520]   and to make sure that she is well cared for,
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.120]   because one of the things that,
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.800]   especially, again, first time moms can happen,
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.120]   is they're like, "Well, I feel great, right?
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.720]   "We had a great experience, here's the baby,
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.760]   "I feel great,"
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.200]   and then they push it too hard.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.880]   They do too much physical activity,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.600]   and because the wounds of childbirth are internal,
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.640]   it's hard to see, right?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.360]   You don't think of your wife as being sick
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.560]   because, well, she looks fine,
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.160]   she's happy, she's full of endorphins,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.680]   like, everything's good.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.400]   No, she still needs to be in bed,
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.800]   she still needs to rest,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.880]   she needs time to simply rest.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.960]   Then she needs time to get to know the baby.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.320]   She needs time to just snuggle and enjoy the baby,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.600]   and the baby needs that
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.960]   in order to build the proper emotional bonds,
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.200]   and so you want her to be in a very comfortable place,
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.720]   to be in a place where she has everything she needs
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.680]   around her,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.720]   and to be able to properly bond with the baby.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.160]   She needs to bond with the baby in the first few weeks,
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.760]   and so moving around a bunch is not a good plan.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.240]   Now, sometimes everything does go easily,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.600]   and I think that for, again, future babies,
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.640]   probably so, right?
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.240]   My wife, having had four babies,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.840]   has more experience now,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.800]   and to me it's very obvious
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.080]   that dealing with a newborn is actually pretty easy, right?
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.600]   So if we had a baby, another baby,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.200]   and that baby was a month old,
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.680]   I mean, with our fourth baby,
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.960]   we traveled when our baby was three weeks old,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.040]   four weeks old, something like that.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.000]   We got on an airplane and we traveled,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.640]   so, and it wasn't a big deal.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.040]   You still have to protect for that first few weeks,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.960]   but you still need to make sure
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.120]   that she has time to learn,
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.440]   and so the skills of breastfeeding,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.280]   the skills of caring for the baby,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.640]   all of those things take time for her to learn.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.520]   In addition, I would just point out
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.200]   that a lot of times babies have weird little problems
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.220]   that take time to figure out.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:17.000]   Our second child was extremely sick as a baby.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.720]   She had GERD and, what's the other one?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.920]   And colic, she had GERD and colic,
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.560]   and so she was just a miserable little baby,
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.680]   and so sometimes you have a miserable baby,
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.720]   and those first few months are brutal,
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.160]   and then the final thing I would point out
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.320]   is that your wife will not want to go and travel
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.800]   and go and see sites
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.060]   when she is taking care of a newborn,
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.000]   just simply because of the amount of round-the-clock care
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.800]   that the newborn requires.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.160]   So babies eat every three hours, every four hours,
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.040]   'cause they have itty-bitty tiny stomachs,
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.600]   and so they need to eat every three or four hours,
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.840]   and that's around the clock,
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.440]   and so her sleep patterns will be messed up,
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.280]   all of that stuff,
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.080]   so you want her to be in the most comfortable place possible.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.540]   You want to make sure that the place that she gives birth
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:09.560]   is where she's totally relaxed, totally confident,
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.200]   and you want to make sure that she has the time
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.600]   and the space to nest with the baby,
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.880]   and that she's just totally comfortable
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.440]   so she can bond with the baby
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.240]   and learn those new skills of motherhood.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.680]   So I would not try to go around a bunch of places.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.040]   Now, would I go somewhere for a birth, like birth tourism?
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.000]   That's hard.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.200]   I think it's really hard for a first-time baby,
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.780]   but I think there are people who do it,
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.280]   but even in that situation, I wouldn't go to many places.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   I would have one place.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.960]   I would set up a really nice environment there,
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.600]   and then just plan to be in that one place
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.260]   so that she can be cared for and protected
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.900]   during those first few weeks of the baby's life.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.640]   - Man, that's great information.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.480]   I appreciate that.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.160]   So probably what we're gonna do then is not plan anything,
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.440]   and since she'll be off for 16 weeks,
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.400]   we'll just see how she feels towards the end of that,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.480]   and then maybe we could pick one place if we wanted to go,
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.200]   and maybe it's just to go visit family for a week or two.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.040]   - Yeah.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.240]   In the past, when we have been expecting a baby,
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.560]   I put everything on hold because you just don't know.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.760]   You just don't know, and so you do everything you can
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.000]   to prepare for the optimal circumstances,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.520]   but you don't know.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.040]   You don't know if the childbirth is smooth
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.840]   or the childbirth is very difficult.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.680]   You don't know if the baby is perfectly happy and healthy
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.720]   or if the baby is sick or handicapped in some way.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.120]   You don't know what the baby is gonna experience
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.420]   in that first few months,
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.600]   and then again, it takes time.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.000]   It takes time for you to learn the skills
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.440]   of caring for a new baby,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.240]   and it takes time for her to learn the skills
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.740]   of caring for a new baby, so I would not,
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.840]   I wouldn't make any plans.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.400]   I would keep the schedule wide open.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.200]   I would plan that we're gonna stay at home,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.840]   and we're gonna hang out, and we're gonna be together,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.120]   and we're not gonna go anywhere,
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.200]   and then if at some point,
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.640]   you find that everything is going well,
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.920]   mama's healthy, baby's healthy and happy,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.240]   and you're working things out, then yeah,
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.160]   then you can travel, and so at this point,
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.520]   I consider a newborn a relatively easy baby to travel with.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.760]   It's easier to travel with a newborn
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.960]   than it is with a two-year-old,
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.140]   but that's after some experience of working with newborns.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.760]   - Great, that's what we'll do then.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.600]   Thanks so much.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.000]   - Good deal, all right, we'll go back to Adam,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.840]   and we'll finish up with Adam.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.760]   You said you had another question.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.320]   Adam, go ahead, please.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.540]   - Yes, sir, so similar vein having to do with me
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.360]   moving from Canada to the US.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.760]   I was hoping if you had any advice
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.360]   on how to quickly build my credit in the States.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.320]   I've read a lot of the sort of standard advice,
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.120]   and I plan on following through with most of it.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.440]   I think the unique situation that I'm in
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.880]   is that I do have very good credit,
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.800]   at least for a 22-year-old, good credit in Canada,
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   excuse me, and I was hoping that maybe
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.140]   I could leverage that some way.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.400]   I have an existing account with American Express,
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.200]   and so I know they have both a Canadian and a US subsidiary,
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.280]   likewise with my Canadian bank.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.440]   Any words of wisdom in this area?
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.200]   - Those are good ideas.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.820]   I've never done this personally,
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.560]   moved from Canada to the United States,
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.680]   and I've not worked with someone, nor have I researched it.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.560]   So my advice is simply from a generalized knowledge,
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.360]   but I think I would start with both of those ideas.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   I would call American Express, and I would explain to them,
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.200]   I would apply for a new American Express card
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.520]   under my US Social Security number.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.840]   I don't know the best way to do it.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.600]   I would call them and talk to an agent,
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.880]   explain the situation to them,
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.320]   and maybe have them do it manually.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.520]   It would be hard, I think, to fill it in on the website
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.200]   in an appropriate way, but since you already have
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.240]   an American Express card in Canada,
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.900]   I would go ahead and apply for one of the blue cash
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.200]   or something like that that's easy to get
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.440]   with American Express under your US Social Security number.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.360]   And then the same thing, if your Canadian bank
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.880]   has an American subsidiary or partner,
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.200]   then I would talk to that, and I would explain again
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.040]   the situation, and just simply apply
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.720]   under your US Social Security number.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.520]   Those two things, I would guess, would probably work.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.840]   If it doesn't work, then I would say,
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.720]   just simply start the standard process
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   of the standard advice.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.880]   If necessary, start with a secured credit card,
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.080]   nothing wrong with that, and then just simply be aggressive
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.000]   about gathering new credit cards
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.720]   and applying for new credit cards in the United States.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.920]   And you can do it very quickly.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.240]   A few months of a secured credit card,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.600]   I mean, starting with zero, do some research
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.120]   on some of the credit cards that are designed
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   for new borrowers, some of the credit cards
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.440]   that are targeted at college students.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.120]   Open an account with a bank, a new account
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.360]   with a US American bank, and get their credit card.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.760]   Open an account with a credit union
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.960]   and get their credit card, and in four or six months,
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.360]   something like that, you could get any credit card
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.200]   that you want.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.800]   And then just follow the advice that I teach
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.200]   in the credit card course about systematically
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.720]   expanding your credit lines,
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.760]   systematically building your portfolio,
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.320]   and keeping your credit score high,
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.120]   and then making sure you have the infrastructure there
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.360]   for that, and yeah, you can do it very quickly.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   In addition, you should consider for maximum credit score,
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:38.260]   then you might consider going ahead in the beginning,
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.860]   borrowing some money with some line of credit
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.220]   other than a credit card.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:44.420]   So take out a small car loan,
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.160]   take out a small student loan, something like that,
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.220]   a couple thousand dollars is sufficient,
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   that will massively increase your credit score very quickly,
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.520]   and then make getting credit cards very easy.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.000]   - Great, that's perfect.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.360]   I'm working through your career
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.480]   and income planning course now,
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.240]   and I think the credit card is gonna be the next one up.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.360]   Thank you very much. - Good, awesome, my pleasure.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.060]   All right, that rounds out our calls for today.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.980]   Thank you all for calling in.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.080]   A bunch of good questions, let me see
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.480]   what closing comments I have for you today.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.000]   I think the closing comments that I would just
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   simply focus on is in what I said
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.200]   with regard to how you need to plan ahead.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.460]   I think that was probably some of the more important ones,
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.240]   but just simply planning ahead.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.800]   Notice that the inflation concerns,
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.280]   there are inflation concerns.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.360]   The caller is correct on what he said
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.560]   about the amount of money that is being created
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.840]   right now in the United States.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.240]   It's bad.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.240]   We've just reached a record where the total national debt
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.760]   equals the total annual budget in the United States.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.600]   It's bad, and it's gonna get worse.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.600]   So again, I'm not a catastrophist or an extremist.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.560]   I'm not predicting impending doom.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.960]   One of the things that I have become convinced of
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.480]   is that the Mad Max scenario,
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.440]   everything falls apart super fast, it's just not realistic.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.040]   Last night I was watching some videos
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.400]   from a Venezuelan YouTuber,
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.280]   and I think his name is Juan Guerrero, something like that.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.000]   And he was in Caracas in Venezuela,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   and here you are observing, it was in Spanish,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   so if you speak Spanish, go and watch it.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.320]   But what you see in a total financial collapse
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.800]   is the fact that everything looks pretty normal.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.580]   There's tremendous problems on all sides,
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.160]   but it doesn't look like Bosnia,
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   at least not in a place like Venezuela.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.420]   It doesn't look like Bosnia.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:53.760]   There's tremendous danger, tremendous physical conflict,
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.400]   lots and lots of violence,
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.800]   but it doesn't look like Bosnia.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.080]   It looks much more like a wacky, messed up system.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.760]   So I have spent a lot of time over the years
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.460]   trying to caution people about how difficult things can be
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.880]   and about the fact that we all need to prepare
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.640]   for things to be difficult.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.560]   And I believe that that is absolutely true.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.800]   We do need to prepare for things to be difficult,
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.420]   and we need to be protected against those things happening.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   But it's not Mad Max, it's not.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:28.600]   So set up your infrastructure in advance,
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.840]   and then you'll have the best,
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.880]   those are the best solutions that I have
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.040]   for those scenarios.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.200]   I'd love to talk to you next week.
