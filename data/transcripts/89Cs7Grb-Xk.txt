[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   Is it biblically acceptable for a mother to hold a full-time job outside of the
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520]   home? This was a question asked of Pastor John a few years back, and this is what
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:24.320]   he had to say. It can be. In fact, I would say outside of the home is a complex
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.240]   statement. It was a complex, I mean, it was complex early on when the farm, I mean
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.560]   only after the Industrial Revolution, was home and work separated, by and large.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.360]   Everywhere there's an agrarian kind of culture, home and work are just together.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440]   If all the kids are weaving the baskets that you sell to make a living, are you
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.080]   home? If the garden around the house is what supports the family and
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.600]   husband's out there building a barn and you're doing this, are you home? So all
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.840]   that to say the very question is ambiguous and it is today, right? A wife
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.400]   can have a full-time job, my niece has a full-time job, her office is in her home.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.520]   She works for a company three states away. So having said it can be, I want to
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.720]   discourage it, okay? I just want to discourage it because mothering and
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:38.720]   homemaking are huge and glorious jobs. What children need at age 1, 5, 6, 14, 18,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.800]   what they need is simply amazing and what it calls forth from a woman's
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.480]   creativity and a woman's heart and a woman's mind personally for each one of
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.200]   these little ones that are coming along or just the home, a home here where
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.280]   ministry can happen and you're not enslaved by anybody's clock. You can say
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.040]   I'm gonna work my tail off for King Jesus but I don't want anybody to pay me for it.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040]   I'm gonna do it right here in this neighborhood with my husband's
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.540]   connections and my connections. We're gonna lavish grace on people's lives. So
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.840]   I'm calling for ministry full-time when I say don't work full-time if you got a
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.040]   family. Turn your family into ministry. Turn your family into a global dream for
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   what this family might become or what this man might be and what we might be
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.280]   together as we are a home. So those are the kind of dreams I want to offer to
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   the younger women that are coming along, that they don't think like, "Oh,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.800]   if I don't get a career and make lots of money and be equal with man and pay and
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   time and everything, they somehow sold out to something small or something that
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.280]   doesn't require intellectual capabilities." It is a great and glorious
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.400]   calling to be a mother and a homemaker and a wife and a neighborhood make-it-
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.240]   happen kind of person and a church minister and who knows what all God
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.160]   might be pleased to do. That was Pastor John Piper. Thank you for listening to
