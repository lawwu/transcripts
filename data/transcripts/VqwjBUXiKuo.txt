[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   Brett, a listener who lives in Warner Robins, Georgia, writes in to ask, "Pastor
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.960]   John, do Christians and Muslims worship the same deity?" I was on a panel a few
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.520]   years ago at the Evangelical Theological Society with a Muslim and another
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.920]   believer, and we each gave presentations, and that was a very eye-opening
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   experience, because the way most people pose this question is almost a defeater.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.640]   If you get into a conversation where they want you to start listing the
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.960]   attributes of Yahweh, or the attributes of your Christian God, and they list the
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   attributes of their God, you wind up with things like sovereignty, wisdom, eternal,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.760]   infinite, just, and here's Allah, they say, with all those, and here's your God with
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.160]   all those, and they say, "Look, it's the same," and the case is closed. That's not a very
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.360]   biblical way to go about it. Here's what I did in my presentation, and when the
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.320]   Muslim stood up after me, he said, "Well, I didn't know you were going to be so
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.800]   Christological." He almost had nothing to say, and here's what I said. I said, "The
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:40.080]   best way to tell if you, sir, and I are worshiping God is to ask Jesus what the
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.320]   test is for the true worship of God," and Jesus said, "If you reject me, if you
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.280]   reject me as the crucified one," and Muslims do reject Him as crucified, "If
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.200]   you reject me as the risen one," and they do reject Him as the risen one, "If you
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.920]   reject me as the one who atones for sins through the shedding of my blood," and
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.240]   they do reject Him for that, so there's no question that Muslims reject the
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.320]   Jesus of the New Testament. They have their own Jesus, but the Jesus that's
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   presented as the Gospel in the New Testament, they explicitly and admittedly
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:26.800]   reject, and Jesus says, "You don't know God if you reject me." So John 8, 7 or 19,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   they said to Him, "Where is your Father?" and Jesus said, "You know neither me nor
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.480]   my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also." If you knew me, John 8, 19,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.720]   "You would know my Father also," but they don't know Him, and therefore they don't
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.080]   know the Father. He's talking to the Pharisees of all people. I mean, if
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   that's true of the Pharisees who claim to know the Father of the Old Testament,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.120]   then how much more true of Muslims. Or He said, "You don't love God,"
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   because He said, "You don't have the love of the Father within you. I have come in
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.880]   my Father's name, and you do not receive me." So He's coming in the Father's name,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.200]   they don't receive Him, therefore He says, "You don't have the love of God
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.120]   within you." Or He says in John 8, 42, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.720]   I came from God, and I'm here." So you don't have Him as your Father. Or in
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.160]   1 John 2, 23, "No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.840]   has the Father also." So they don't have the Father. Or John 6, 45, "Everyone who
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.960]   has heard and learned from God comes to me, but they don't come to Him, and
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.160]   therefore they haven't heard and learned from the Father." So you get all these
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.960]   passages where Jesus and 1 John say that the litmus test, the proof of
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.040]   whether anybody has a relationship with God, is truly worshiping God, is whether
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.000]   or not they truly embrace Jesus. So if you just list it out, they don't know God,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.940]   they don't love God, they don't honor God, they don't have God as their Father, they
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.400]   don't have Him at all, those are all texts where Jesus said, "If you don't have
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.200]   me, you don't know God. If you don't have me, you don't love God. If you don't have
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.720]   me, you don't honor God. If you don't have me, God is not your Father." From which I
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.400]   conclude, I don't care how many attributes line up between your God and
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.920]   my God, Jesus says you can't be worshiping the Father if you're
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.360]   rejecting Him. And that's the approach I think we should take with all Muslims.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.840]   We should befriend all the Muslims in our lives, and there are many, at least in my
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.600]   neighborhood, there are many people who you can befriend like that. And we tell
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.560]   them the unsearchable riches of Christ, and we especially go to the Gospel where
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.480]   the glory of God is revealed in the death and the resurrection of Christ.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.160]   Thank you, Pastor John. The panel mentioned at the beginning of this
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.280]   podcast was recorded at the Evangelical Theological Society meeting on November
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.440]   18th, 2009, and it can be found online at DesiringGod.org. There you can search
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.000]   for the resource by its title, "Evangelicals and a Common Word." That's
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.520]   "Evangelicals and a Common Word." I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
