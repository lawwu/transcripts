[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.360]   But doing it through the Patreon page gives me a convenient way to just meter the flow
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.220]   just a little bit and make sure I don't have too many calls.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.800]   We begin today with Tim.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   Tim, welcome to the show.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   Can you hear me?
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   Sounds good.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   Good.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:47.240]   I just changed jobs and I'm moving my retirement to what I think would be the best option,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.160]   the pension versus a 401(k).
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.760]   I first wanted to know whether it's more valuable to move it to the 401(k) versus to an IRA.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.160]   And then whether it's worth it to pull the funds out as an indirect 60-day rollover to
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   leverage the market downturn or whether it's too high risk.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   All right.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.760]   So let's deal with the first one first because it's fairly simple and fairly straightforward.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   Generally speaking, when you leave an old company, generally speaking, you will want
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   to move your money from the old 401(k) into a traditional IRA that you control in the
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.200]   open market.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.040]   There is one exception to that, one reason not to.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   Two reasons.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.240]   Let me go with two, maybe three.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.860]   We'll see when I get there and the answer whether it's two or three.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.600]   But the primary reason why you choose to move your 401(k) from the old company into your
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.140]   own independently controlled traditional IRA is because you then open up the world of investing
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.360]   to work with any custodian and to work with basically any investment option that you are
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.480]   personally interested in.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.720]   This means that you can go to the best custodian out there.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040]   You're not limited to the custodian that previously had your funds.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.240]   And it means that you can invest in anything that you can set up, even to the point of
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   setting up a self-directed IRA, which would allow you to invest in all kinds of exotic
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.840]   assets, all kinds of interesting things.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.160]   Now, most people, of course, shouldn't do that.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.120]   That'd be unwise for most people, but that's the reason why.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   This can sometimes, so the big benefit is investment flexibility.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.000]   Sometimes you can also save a decent amount of money with costs.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.320]   Some people have old 401(k)s that have fairly high embedded expenses.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.040]   And so by going to your own independent IRA, you can carefully reduce your costs.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.720]   Why wouldn't you do that?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.520]   Well, number one would be the big one is that in some states you will lose a significant
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   amount of asset protection benefits on your funds by making that move.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   401(k)s or any other type of qualified plans are exempt from the claims of creditors under
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.280]   federal bankruptcy laws.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.960]   That means that if someone sues you, unless it's a super creditor, such as the IRS or
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.480]   a divorcing spouse who can indeed access a 401(k), unless it's a super creditor, somebody
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.720]   who's suing you for money will not be able to attach or get your 401(k) money.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.860]   In addition, a 401(k) is protected in bankruptcy court.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.880]   So if you're ever forced into bankruptcy, then the money that's in your 401(k) is protected
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.800]   under federal bankruptcy law.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.960]   IRAs, however, are not qualified accounts.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.800]   And because they are not qualified accounts, they are not governed by the same legislation
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400]   that protects a 401(k).
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.020]   The taxation is not any different.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.200]   Qualified account does not mean that the taxation is any different.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.600]   There are no tax consequences for doing the rollover.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.200]   It's taxed identically.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.080]   The key thing is simply that because they're not qualified accounts, you rely on state
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   law to answer whether or not those assets are protected from creditors and whether or
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.880]   not those assets are protected in bankruptcy court.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   Some states have applied the same level of protection to IRAs as exist in 401(k)s.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360]   So for example, I'm from the state of Florida.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.800]   Florida has legislation stating IRAs, Roth IRAs, all of these are exempt accounts and
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.840]   protected from the claims of creditors, the same as a 401(k).
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.720]   However, there are many other states, I don't remember the exact number, but at least a
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.560]   third to a half of states in the United States that don't protect IRAs to the same degree
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.640]   which have minor exemptions for IRAs from the claims of creditors.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.000]   And so those states need to be careful.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.400]   Now if you are living in a state where you get good protection from an IRA, I think it's
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.640]   a minor point and you should just go ahead and move it to an IRA.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.040]   In addition, if you don't have any reason to think that this might be super important,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.640]   meaning that you're not facing creditors, you're not facing an impending lawsuit, etc.,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.180]   then you would still want to, you would just go ahead and put it in an IRA because chances
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.720]   are it's not a necessary part of it.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.520]   However, if I were facing or knew that I could face some kind of adverse action in the future,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.560]   either get sued, be forced into bankruptcy, etc., I myself would choose to make sure that
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.240]   I maintain the umbrella of the qualified account, the 401(k), as part of my overall asset protection
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.560]   scheme, especially if I wound up moving among states and thus being subject to different
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.920]   states' laws.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.820]   So I don't think it's a big deal for most people, but it is a big deal for the few people
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.400]   for whom it applies, which is why I'm always careful to mention it.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   The second reason why you wouldn't take your money out of the 401(k) would be if you have
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.040]   a superior option at that 401(k).
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.360]   So contrary to what I said earlier about moving your money to an IRA and getting lower expenses,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.760]   sometimes 401(k)s can be very, very inexpensive, depending on how we use it.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.920]   For example, if you work for the government and you have access to the government plan,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   well, you get great funds at a great price, you get access to the guaranteed fund, you
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.960]   have wonderful options that you don't have in the private market.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.400]   Years ago I used to have a pension that was this way, and so I could roll it out, but
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.180]   if I rolled it out, I lost the ability to invest in the better funds that were available
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.960]   to me in my pension.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.560]   In addition, sometimes you're working for a company that just has a wonderfully inexpensive
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.800]   401(k) plan and it has just the options you need.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.000]   And so you want to keep an eye on expenses, you want to keep an eye on fund choice, etc.,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.840]   because sometimes you may have a fund choice that's been negotiated for you in the 401(k)
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.680]   and you can't beat it in the open market.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.200]   For most people I think that's not true, but in some cases it is true.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.260]   And then the third reason, which I'll just mention in passing, is that if you are anticipating
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.600]   early retirement, you can actually, if you separate from service and you have money in
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:27.000]   a 401(k), you can withdraw your money without any tax penalties starting at the age of 55
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200]   rather than waiting for 59 and a half.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:37.720]   And at that point in time, so that gives you an extra 4 and a half years of no penalty
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.240]   to withdraw your funds.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.480]   And so some are pursuing early retirement and that would be a good reason to keep your
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.420]   money at the 401(k) so that you can separate from service at 55, start making distributions
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.320]   and be able to continue on.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.860]   I guess one more point I would add actually would be sometimes a company will have a provision
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.320]   for a 401(k) loan.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.000]   I'm struggling to remember, I don't think that would generally be allowed if you've
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   separated from service.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   But another good reason to have your money in a 401(k) is that you can take a 401(k)
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.080]   loan under some plan documents whereas you can't generally take a loan against an IRA
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.760]   without doing the goofy 60-day rollover thing that we're about to talk about.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.120]   So those are my comments on reasons to consider keeping a 401(k).
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.560]   Most people go ahead and move it to an IRA but keep those reasons in mind.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.800]   So hopefully I've explained that.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.360]   Now explain to me your question about doing a 60-day rollover and how you're hoping to
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.600]   use it to save money.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   Sure.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:10:04.680]   So I have the ability to take the funds out of one account and then wait 60 days maximum
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.560]   to put them into the new retirement fund.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.760]   And given the way that the market has been trending, I'm wondering whether it's even
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:21.000]   worth it to take the risk of say keeping it out there for 45 days and then putting it
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.400]   in the account and sort of sidestepping the losses that seem to be pretty apparent over
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.140]   the next month or two.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.960]   You think the market is going to go down in the next month or two?
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.640]   Yes.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:44.560]   So I would just say to answer that question, you would need to disconnect the two issues.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.640]   Number one, there are sometimes reasons to do the 60-day transfer.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:11:00.600]   And basically the reason is if you need access to the money for a very short-term bridge
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:08.680]   loan of some kind, you can use a scheme where you close the money out of one account, take
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.960]   possession of the check from the investment company, use the money, and then before the
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.640]   60-day period ends, get it into a second account.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.480]   It is risky, but there have been times, I've suggested it in a couple of situations, where
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.440]   you just need a source of bridge financing and you need quick access to money, you can
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   use that law to your favor.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.800]   It's risky, as I stated, it's risky, but that can in some cases be something that you want
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   to do.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.720]   However, in the scenario you're proposing, I don't see any reason why you need to do
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   that.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.880]   If you want to make a market bet, just simply put the money into a cash account at whatever
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   fund provider you're going to use and then sit back and make your market bet.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.760]   So if you believe that stocks are going to go down a month and a half from now, or for
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.520]   the next month or two, fine, just put the money into a cash account and don't take the
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.200]   risk of failing that transfer in time, such meaning that you have an unintended IRA distribution.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.520]   You don't need to do the 60-day game in order for you to take action on your stock market
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.200]   prediction.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:34.360]   The only piece that has me a little concerned about keeping the money out would be if you…
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:41.480]   I think there's something where they withhold a certain amount, like 20% of the total amount
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.800]   until the end of the year, so you need to front the cash to do something like that.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   Correct.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   Correct.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.840]   So the key is, it's always simpler just to do a custodian to custodian transfer.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.200]   And simplicity is good.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.040]   So I would encourage you, I don't see any reason in what you described why you should
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.920]   play the 60-day game or why you should take possession of the funds directly.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.240]   Open the new account with your investment provider, get the transfer instructions, then
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.880]   simply take those transfer instructions to the 401k custodian and have them do a direct
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.440]   custodian to custodian transfer.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.880]   But simply direct that money into a cash account and then you can invest it when you believe
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.240]   that it's the right time to invest.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   Okay.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   Okay.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Well, incidentally, we're closing on a house in mid-July, so it is possible that we may
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.840]   or could actually use those funds.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:44.280]   If that were to be the case, I mean, I think I talked to both the old retirement and the
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.880]   new and they said there's no time limit within what you need to make your transfer,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.720]   that you can take them out at any time.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.960]   If I were to leverage those funds, is that something that you could actually use for
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.480]   that purpose?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   Could it be used?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480]   Yes.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.160]   Do you need to use it?
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.960]   That would be my question.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.600]   Why would you need to do that?
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.960]   What would you need the cash for in order to close on the house?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.000]   What do you need the money for?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   If something came up either with interest rates or where we just simply didn't have
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   enough cash to close but could easily make that up in the following months.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.280]   So yes, it is an option.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.680]   I would rather you do a 401k loan, if you can do that after having separated from service,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.720]   then do the 60-day rollover option.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.280]   Rollover, yes.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.000]   If you need the money, then you can take the money out, you will have possession of it
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.960]   and if you can get it into the next plan before the 60-day expires, then there are no adverse
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.760]   tax effects.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.840]   However, they are going to deduct the 20% taxes if you do that and so you have to plan
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:04.640]   that in as well and make up the taxes in order for you to meet the rollover.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.280]   So I would prefer you do a 401k loan if you can do that, but if you get down to the end
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.180]   of the day and we've got to close on this two weeks from now and I need an extra little
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.380]   bit of money and you can see that that could work, then yes, it is a nice option to have
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.000]   in your back pocket.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.760]   I would repeat, before I would do it, number one, I would do a personal loan from a friend
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.880]   or a relative.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.400]   I would do a 0% credit card loan.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.320]   I would exhaust almost every other form of financing before I would do this because number
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:42.560]   one, them withholding the taxes by taking the transfer directly to you is inconvenient
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.120]   and there is often a lot of risk that you don't get it done.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.880]   60 days sounds like a long time.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.080]   60 days is not really that long and so I would use myself every other form of financing that
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.920]   was available to me before I would do this one.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.960]   I just think it's riskier and if you have a sizable 401k, it can be a significant penalty
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.000]   if you don't get it exactly right.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Okay.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Makes sense?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.560]   It all makes sense.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   Good stuff.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   Great questions.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   Wonderful.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   We move on to Adam.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   There we go.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   Adam, welcome to the show.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Hi, Josh.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   Thanks for taking the call.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:25.880]   I'm a digital nomad, an American citizen, an EU citizen living in Europe, kind of down
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:31.320]   bouncing around and my girlfriend will soon be finishing school and joining me in the
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:37.920]   digital nomad life and I had a couple of questions about what might be the best way to set up
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.360]   her financial architecture.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.120]   I have myself set up but I kind of want to get her together.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:53.320]   Her plan is when she finishes is to set up a freelance design business and essentially
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.760]   what we do is travel between different EU countries and never stay anywhere long enough
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.480]   to become a tax resident.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.120]   She is a EU citizen as well or she will be in a few months.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:12.360]   She's from outside of Europe and is looking to sever her connections to her very tax unfriendly
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.000]   native land.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.760]   She's kind of like a free agent and can set up shop wherever she wants.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:26.240]   I guess my question is what would be the most advantageous way to set up a business inside
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   of Europe?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.520]   A lot of people say Estonia or Malta.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.320]   How should we approach this question?
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.800]   I guess if you need more information I can give you.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.620]   I don't want to rant for too long.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:42.560]   Which country is she a citizen of and which country is she moving from?
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:54.000]   She's moving from Argentina and she is going to be an Italian citizen but she has no meaningful
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.360]   connection to Italy aside from a grandparent which is how she got the passport.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.560]   You said she was trying to move out of her high tax country.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   Did you mean Argentina?
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.960]   Okay.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.320]   So this is good.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.360]   So she is an Argentinian citizen.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.280]   She's claiming Italian citizenship by descent and she's in that process and she's planning
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:26.000]   to join you in the European Union living a digital nomad lifestyle after she finishes
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   her studies.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Correct.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Correct.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Okay.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.560]   And the idea is she'll have the Italian passport but she has no bank accounts in Europe or
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.240]   anything so she can sort of pick her country where she wants to set up shop and we're just
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.000]   bouncing around the EU essentially.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   You are an American citizen and also an EU citizen.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   So yeah.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.880]   There's another wrinkle with me which is that I have a salaried position in the United
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.600]   Kingdom and I can't get out of that.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.800]   I draw a salary there and then I use the tax credit to pay for my US taxes or to cover
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.360]   what would be my US tax obligation.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.520]   But I don't go to the UK.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.320]   I just draw a salary there and have a checking account and that's really it for me there.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.880]   Do you maintain your financial infrastructure in the United States?
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   Correct.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.080]   I mean I contribute to a Roth every year.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:32.000]   Essentially I use American credit cards because the remittance fee is less than the difference
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.440]   in the rewards that I get from my American credit card.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   So everything for me runs through the US except for the UK checking account where I get my
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   salary.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   Right.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   Okay.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:49.320]   And so you don't have, although you, so you enter the European Union using your EU passport
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.520]   but you don't declare an EU tax residency currently.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.920]   You just simply maintain your American tax residency and you float around.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   Exactly.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.120]   So this is one of those gray areas of international planning.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:13.200]   And it's gray because there, it's a gray area which means that you can choose various ways
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.520]   to structure this.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.720]   Let me think of how to begin.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.320]   So first, the good news for your girlfriend.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.520]   Let's just deal with her first.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.880]   The good news is this.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.720]   If she leaves Argentina, I'm not familiar with what would be necessary of reporting
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   for the Argentinian government to end things.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.960]   But she should research what is necessary for the Argentinian government for her to
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.520]   say I'm leaving Argentina, I'm moving abroad, and I'm no longer going to be a resident or
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.720]   a tax resident of Argentina.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   Given the fact that...
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   So I can speak to that really quickly.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Go ahead.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Please, yeah, please do.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Educate me.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.680]   So she's, you know, she's a few years younger than me.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.040]   She's worked before but it was always informal, kind of under the table, you know, like Argentina
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   or Italy is often the case.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Of course, of course.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.320]   So I don't think she's formally paid taxes there.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.000]   So the idea is I think she'll get her passport by the end of this year and would not begin
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.520]   working in Europe to avoid any entanglements with Argentina until January 1st, you know,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.460]   the new calendar year which is also the new tax year for Argentina, and then just be free
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.400]   and clear and put that country in her rear view, you know, aside from visiting family
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.000]   once a year or whatever it is.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Right, good.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.920]   So you're making the point that I was going to make is that if she's in university, there's
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.040]   a good chance she's not generating any meaningful income, she's not... she doesn't have a high
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.280]   target on her back.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.840]   She can most likely just leave and, you know, renew her passport for convenience before
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.320]   she leaves, of course, get the maximum duration passport and she can just simply leave.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.260]   Regardless, though, many countries...
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.120]   So there are only some countries in the world that have a formal exit requirement.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.020]   So a country like Canada has a formal exit requirement.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.960]   If you want to leave, you need to file an exit tax return with the CRA, you need to
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.560]   end your ties with Canada, etc.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:13.240]   Argentina would be much less bureaucratic from that regard and fewer requirements for
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   her.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.680]   So when she finishes her studies, I would say most likely she can just simply finish
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.240]   her studies, take her diploma, get on an airplane and go wherever she wants.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.000]   And of course, the Argentinian passport is a very useful passport, gives her... it's
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.360]   a great... it's a very useful passport.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:36.760]   So then, with regard to the Italian government, her claim to Italian citizenship does not
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.800]   in and of itself generate any liability with the Italian government or with the European
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.340]   Union generally.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:49.680]   So the basic function is that that's just simply her claim by descent.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   Now if she moved to Italy, she could become a tax resident, but you're seeking to avoid
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   that.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.040]   And the thing that you're doing right is what you want to do is you want to avoid tax
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   residence.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.840]   It's more about where you're not a tax resident than necessarily where you are a tax resident.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:11.040]   So this is where you have to be very careful, especially with several countries in the European
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   Union.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.400]   Several countries in the European Union are very well organized and they have rules and
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:22.520]   they will, if you spend substantial amounts of time in that country, they can and will
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.280]   say, "Listen, you're a tax resident."
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.520]   And so it's more a matter of not becoming a tax resident of a country that you don't
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:34.280]   want to be a tax resident of than it is of where specifically are you a tax resident.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:40.640]   So as an Italian, once she has her Italian passport, she could simply join you and of
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.260]   course she could join you on her Argentinian passport, but once she has her Italian passport,
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.480]   she could join you.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.680]   And generally speaking, I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:54.640]   As long as you're not, I don't think she needs to declare a tax residency in Europe necessarily,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.400]   as long as she's not becoming a tax resident of any one particular country.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   So she, because of the simplicity of having an EU passport, she doesn't have the same
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.660]   visa controls that others have, but you'll just want to make sure that you don't become
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.960]   a tax resident of any particular country in Europe.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.680]   What's wrong with that plan?
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.160]   Well basically it's a matter of what infrastructure do I need?
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:27.800]   So if I'm going to go and start a business, where is that business going to be based?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.320]   If you base the business in the European Union with some kind of formal structure, now that's
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.440]   going to start to create a tie.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.400]   And you can choose a country that you're not a resident of, but is that really necessary?
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:47.440]   And so, and then the other wrinkle is that increasingly the place where you need to declare
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.280]   tax residency is often now with banking.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.080]   Banking has become so difficult to deal with in the modern world, and that's where, they
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.040]   say, where are you a tax resident of?
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.420]   And that's where it's convenient to be able to report, here's where I'm a tax resident.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:09.800]   So I could give some specific, I'm trying to think of how much to say here in a public
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.440]   format.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:21.000]   I'll say this, so number one, make sure that you're not generating a claim to tax residency
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.120]   based upon your actions.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.600]   So don't buy a car in Germany and spend nine months a year in Germany.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.960]   Make sure that if you pass through Germany, that you're genuinely passing through.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.480]   There are a few problematic countries in the EU that you'll just want to be careful that
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.440]   you don't trigger those countries' problems.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.040]   From what you're describing, if she were making quite a lot of money or had a large and established
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:55.000]   business, then I think there are several really good options in Europe for people who want
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.080]   to establish a formal tax residency so that they have the proper cover.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:07.840]   And that's important, I believe, for somebody who is, who has a substantial income or a
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.280]   substantial business.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.080]   But I think from what you're describing, I'm imagining her doing kind of a digital nomad
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.520]   thing, starting a couple of businesses, maybe some of them hit, but I'm not imagining she's
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.600]   going to make $5 million this next year.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.960]   Do you think, am I right in my perception there?
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   >>Toby: Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   >>Dave: Yeah.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   >>Toby: If I can interject for a second.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.400]   So I myself, I've been doing the digital nomad thing in Europe.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.640]   She studied in Europe, it's how we met each other, for about two and a half, three years
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   now.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.040]   We're in like eight different countries and I've kind of gotten a pretty good grip on
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.600]   not becoming a tax resident wherever I go, follow the rules, make sure it's up to six
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.160]   months or up to three months, whatever.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.260]   So I'm not so much worried about that aspect because she's kind of just happy to go and
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.280]   explore Europe with me.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.560]   The real question is, and the other sort of irony, I mean, we're going, we intend to get
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.760]   married at some point in the near future, the next year or two.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.800]   And her income is less important.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.400]   I will be sort of the breadwinner.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.600]   So I'm just thinking of if she does have this freelance business, we don't know how big
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   it will grow, right?
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.440]   Or what it will look like, but we figure the money needs to go somewhere and we don't want
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.080]   to send it to Argentina, right?
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.560]   Given just what a nightmare that they are, right?
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   >>Dave: Right, of course.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   >>Toby: To deal with.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   So it's just a matter for her of picking which country do you want to set up your bank account
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.720]   and register your business.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.120]   And the idea may possibly be to not even touch the money from her business because I believe
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.840]   in a country like Estonia, for my initial reason, for example, you don't have to pay
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.200]   tax from the business.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.880]   >>Dave: Yeah.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.520]   I wouldn't do, you're breaking up a little bit, so I'm just going to talk for a second
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.120]   while your phone reconnects.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.960]   I don't see any benefit in your case for Estonia.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.400]   I would use the US.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.800]   I think the US is perfect for this, especially with her not being an American.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   >>Toby: For her?
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   >>Dave: Yeah, for her.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   The US is perfect for this.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.000]   So she can set up banking in the United States.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.840]   You'll have to be careful with what banks, but the United States is a world-class banking
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.720]   destination, very good banks.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.800]   Of course, there are many other countries and not all, not, not, not, there's so many
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.960]   US people in the United States trying to go abroad.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.040]   I think the United States is a great place for her to bank.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.920]   I think the United States is a great place for her to run her business.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.360]   I think the United States is a great place for her to keep money.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:45.200]   And so if she's looking for one simple solution, I think the United States can be a really,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.280]   really good solution for her.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.920]   I think that from a business perspective, she may not need any kind of business, any
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:02.280]   kind of complex business structure, but a US single member LLC and owned by an offshore
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.840]   company gives her the ability to run all of her stuff in the United States, access US
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.440]   banking, access US merchant payment processing, et cetera, that won't generate any tax nexus
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.360]   for her with the US as long as she's thoughtful and careful.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.920]   Even she can invest in the United States, right?
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   Non-US persons can invest in the US stock market.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.320]   No, no taxes.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.120]   And so I think the United States would be a good place for her to begin with that.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.840]   Otherwise, while she's in Argentina, I think that there are some good options potentially
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.400]   in Uruguay that would go across the border there.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.040]   It's a standard destination.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.240]   And if she needs to start, she should start while she has a simple story to tell, that
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.460]   I'm an Argentinian living in Argentina, et cetera.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.680]   She should see if she can access that.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.960]   And then, of course, as her wealth grows, she can access many of the banking options
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.800]   in Europe.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.600]   I think the big thing that you have to help her with is that even in your case, digital
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.160]   nomad, you need to have a clear story that makes sense where she has what phone number
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:11.840]   do I have, what address do I have, where do I receive mail, what's my story that I tell?
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.200]   Because the world is not friendly to nomads who don't have a clear story, who don't have
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.000]   good contact information.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   And so I would begin now by just having her develop that and build that.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.320]   But I think the United States should be your primary place to look first.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   >>Tom: Right.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.560]   And you're saying she could build that out in the US, for example.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.880]   For example, use the American address that I still use of a relative or something like
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.480]   that for what she's doing, or a PO box.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   >>Aaron: Absolutely.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   >>Tom: Thanks.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   OK.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480]   So I'll look into that.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   I hadn't thought about the US.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   I guess from what I had heard from talking to people in Europe, they said, well, if she
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   has European clients, she may need to set up shop in Europe.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.600]   But I'm not sure if that's correct or not.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.160]   The follow-up question I have related to this is, when we do get married, the intention
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.600]   is to sort of merge our finances.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:13.240]   Are there issues for me, for example, as an American citizen, giving her a credit card
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.120]   on my account, like in her name, but through my account, even though she's not a US citizen?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   Are there any frictions or problems with integrating her into my financial life when it comes to
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   that?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.160]   >>Aaron: If you're very, very wealthy and you're facing estate taxes, it is complicated
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:41.880]   to have an American married to a non-American, because you don't have an unlimited transfer
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.360]   of money between spouses for the purposes of estate tax planning.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.640]   Assuming that you're not yet that wealthy, the answer is basically no.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.880]   And in fact, it opens up a significant number of benefits to you in your business endeavors.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:06.240]   I of course would not, I myself would not base a marriage decision based upon the citizenship
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.680]   papers that someone does or doesn't hold, obviously.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.720]   But as a planner, if you come to me and you say, "I'm an American who's not married to
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.520]   an American," it opens, I would encourage, and I like living outside the United States,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   right?
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.120]   Because many people who marry an American, they would love to live in the United States
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.560]   because of the many lifestyle benefits.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.960]   But if you are an American not married to an American, sorry, married to someone who's
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.360]   not an American, then I would beg you, don't just automatically go and create ties with
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.440]   the United States.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.160]   Because you can use your marriage, if you have your finances joined and you join your
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.440]   business efforts, you can use your marriage very efficiently.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.720]   A couple of opportunities that opens up.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:54.360]   Number one, an American who owns a business and who works for a company is liable to the
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.320]   US government on all of his income from around the world.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.800]   Now, of course, there are some useful tax exemptions for living outside the United States.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:10.520]   You can lower your taxes substantially to the US by living outside of the US.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:17.680]   But someone who's not an American can genuinely eliminate all of her taxes.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.080]   I'll talk to your girlfriend.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.320]   She can genuinely, legally eliminate all of her taxes and never create that tax nexus
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.080]   with the United States.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:34.440]   So the reason I'm suggesting that the United States be an option is simply that it sounds
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.040]   like she's going to take a little while to figure out how to make money with her business.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.120]   However, if she is more established or if you become more established, you and she can
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.000]   build a large business.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.160]   And in that case, I would take it to one of the tax-free, the genuine tax-free jurisdictions.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:00.880]   And so you can use the various tax havens of the world and you can legitimately set
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:09.640]   up a completely zero-tax lifestyle, even earning $100 million a year if the business fits that
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.120]   model where you don't generate local income tax requirements due to physical presence,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   etc.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.960]   So let's say that she sets up an online business making $100 million a year.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.740]   She can go and she can take her business to Hong Kong, Dubai.
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.760]   She could take it to one of the Caribbean countries, but Hong Kong and Dubai both excellent.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   Let's say it was Hong Kong, right?
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.300]   She's a Hong Kong corporation.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.920]   She won't pay any taxes in Hong Kong.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.080]   She can do her banking in Singapore.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.100]   She can set up her tax residency if she needs to, which would be convenient.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.140]   She can set it up easily.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:47.520]   She can go to Greece, would be a good solution, or a zero-tax or a territorial tax jurisdiction.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.760]   And so you can set up a genuinely tax-free lifestyle and she can live that way as a non-American.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:01.560]   You as an American, you do not pay tax on money that's transferred to you by your rich
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.860]   spouse because you're married.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.600]   And so if she has a business that she earns lots of money, then she can earn the money.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.240]   The money can stay in a tax haven and you don't have to pay tax on the income simply
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.380]   because it's a spousal transfer.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:21.440]   So that can help you both to enjoy a high marital lifestyle without your necessarily
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.200]   paying American taxes.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.320]   That's something that's not open to those of us who are Americans married to Americans.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.160]   In addition, you can then ask...
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   Go ahead.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   Oh, sorry.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.680]   Just on this subject now, let's say we get married.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.400]   I don't know, we'd probably do it in Europe or Argentina or something.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.760]   When I'm filing my taxes, do I still file them as a single person or am I able to...
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   Or should I say that I'm in my American taxes, that is?
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.120]   Does the US recognize my marriage if it's outside of the US?
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.760]   The US does recognize your marriage if it's outside of the United States.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:03.840]   The tax filing designation that you choose, you don't owe...
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   I'm trying to remember if you have to file as single if you're married or if you have
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.520]   to file as married filing separately or if you have to file as single.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:18.160]   I would assume, although I haven't done it myself being married to an American, I would
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.200]   assume that you would just simply file married filing separately.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.820]   But the point is that your wife, if she does not become a US person, meaning she doesn't
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.120]   become a US green card holder or other permanent...
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.960]   She doesn't become a permanent resident, she doesn't become a US citizen and/or she doesn't
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:40.480]   become a US person for tax purposes, triggering something like the substantial presence test
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.720]   or getting some kind of residency visa in the United States that would subject her to
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.200]   taxes or creating some kind of tax nexus with the United States.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.920]   If she doesn't become a US person, then no, there's no requirement that she file or report
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.680]   any of her income to the United States.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:02.080]   She doesn't automatically have a tax agreement with the United States simply by being married
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.880]   to an American, nor do you have to report her income as a non-American on your American
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.040]   tax return.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.360]   You simply need to continue to file tax returns for your income personally.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.040]   Got it, got it.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.000]   The last question, a real quick one, is just...
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.520]   I'm going to Google all this, of course, do my own research, but I don't know if you have
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.680]   a book or blog recommendation for setting up a business in the US if you're not a citizen
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.480]   or any particular further reading recommendations you might have on this subject.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.920]   You'll find plenty with a web search.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.320]   That's what the whole industry in the United States does.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.000]   Whether it's a big corporation or whether it's a small, there's plenty of options available
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.540]   and there's plenty of business agents that will help with those details.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.160]   If you're outside the United States, no doubt you get served ads all the time for companies
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.720]   that offer to help you set up an international tax ID number, an ITIN.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   There's plenty of information available.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.760]   I don't have a specific book, but there's plenty of information available.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.840]   I would say that you can do it, you can figure it out yourself.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.320]   It's pretty simple, it's totally legal.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.840]   The US does very well at this.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.920]   The other thing I was going to point out really quickly is that it's also beneficial to you
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.800]   being married to a non-American because if your assets grow, there are some really cool
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.720]   things you can do in the world of international trusts that Americans cannot participate in.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:39.800]   Because Americans have to report and pay taxes on any trusts that they are trustees of or
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:47.400]   that they control around the world, then for most Americans, there's no tax benefits for
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.980]   doing international trust planning.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.360]   But if you have a non-American spouse, then you can use international trusts to hold your
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   assets.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.040]   So a non-American spouse or family member can be the trustee on those accounts, and
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.760]   then the Americans then only have to pay tax on income that they receive from the trust.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:13.360]   So the point is, it's actually a pretty big benefit to mixing those two together if you
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.160]   don't want to live in the United States, meaning that you can use the American and the non-American
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.680]   status to your advantage.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   >> Steve: Oh, this is great.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   The only hard part is going to be making a hundred million dollars.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.680]   >> Josh: Exactly.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   >> Steve: This all sounds excellent.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.320]   So once we get to that part, maybe I'll call you back.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.960]   Well, I think maybe at that point I won't need the Patreon.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   I'll hire some spouse employers.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   >> Josh: Exactly.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   >> Steve: Until then, I appreciate it, Josh.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   Thanks so much.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   >> Josh: My pleasure.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   All right, we move on to, let's go to 219 Area Code.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.760]   Oh, I already got you.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   That was Tim.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.320]   Sorry, Tim, I forgot to hang up on you.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   Let's go to, it was Trey.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   Trey, welcome to the show.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.320]   How can I serve you today?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   Trey, you're up.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   >> Trey: Sorry about that, Josh.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   Hey, I wanted to ask.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   So we, my wife is a professional and has devoted a lot of time to her schooling.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.720]   We got one kid who is just about to turn a year old, but she's not really ready to, you
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   know, stay home.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.880]   She doesn't really want to do that yet, if at all.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.920]   But what we are doing is I got a remote job and she also, it looks like she's about to
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   get a remote job where she can have basically the same position that she has right now,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   which she loves doing, loves the job.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.200]   But yeah, so it's going to open up a lot more opportunity for us.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.280]   The thing that I was wondering though is obviously, you know, two professionals working at home
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   doesn't mean that you don't need childcare.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   >> Josh: Of course not.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   >> Trey: Especially with a one year old.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:47.860]   And so I was kind of, since this is radical personal finance, I had kind of a radical
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.440]   idea, especially for somebody who's not really wealthy.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.680]   I wanted to know if you had any knowledge about the use of au pairs.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.080]   It's kind of like live in help so that, you know, we'd still be at the house and we could
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.640]   check in with them all the time, but they would have a designated sort of caregiver
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   during the day.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   >> Josh Yeah.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.400]   Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful thing to do.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.900]   And so if both you and your wife are generating income, then you should certainly be able
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.900]   to afford it.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.640]   I think it's one of the best things that you can do.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:25.300]   I think that the reason is that you, so let me back up.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.240]   In a perfect world, what would we do?
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.520]   In a perfect world, we would have with children, especially babies, which is what you have,
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:41.460]   we would have one on one attention all the time so that there is a loving adult who's
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.360]   there for the child at all times.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.420]   That would be a perfect world.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:53.920]   And then expanding from that, we would recognize that there are benefits to having, there are
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   benefits to having social contact, right, child playing with others, having friends,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.920]   etc.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.400]   And so it wouldn't always be just a child and an adult, but it would be a child with
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   friends.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:12.140]   And then usually the most important relationship to nurture is generally going to be between
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.780]   the mother and the baby.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.800]   And then also the father and the baby.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.160]   So clearly the mother's bond is more important at an early age, especially for a baby.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:29.120]   A baby and a mother have a very close connection that goes beyond even, I mean, it includes
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.440]   just tremendous levels of personal biology, right?
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.920]   The mother literally, after bearing a child, carries the baby's blood in her, it's my understanding,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.600]   for the rest of her life.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.360]   A mother's body responds to the baby's needs.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.280]   For example, a breastfeeding mother will, a mother's body will change the makeup and
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:53.120]   the chemical composition of the breast milk in response to what the baby's body needs.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:43:00.000]   The smell of the baby invokes a response in the mother that affects her body to change
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   breast milk.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.840]   And so a breastfed baby is something that obviously you need the mother to do.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:14.400]   Now going back off of that, if we say this is not the choice that seems appropriate for
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:22.840]   us right now, then we say how can we get as close to that as is possible and can we bring
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.880]   in other benefits?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:33.200]   So let's say that your wife died and you were left with a child and your wife was dead.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.240]   Well, if that happened to me, I would want my children to have the same close relationship
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.760]   of care and so of course I would want to provide that.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.680]   If I couldn't provide that, then I would look and say how could I hire someone to provide
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   that?
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.600]   So if you think about wealthy families throughout history, how have they done this?
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.240]   Well traditionally it's with a governess.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.680]   You have a governess.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:03.760]   And so you have a full-time employee who cares for your child or for your children.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.320]   And when you think about British literature and the British culture, this is a very, very
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   common thing.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.600]   You have a mother that they have plenty of money.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.320]   The mother doesn't want to be kind of a full-time on-demand mother all the time.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.960]   She has other things that she's doing and so she has a governess.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.560]   You go to a very wealthy family in the United States, generally you'll see that they have
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.160]   some kind of live-in servant who cares for the children, who provides for the children,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   etc. and the mother and father are not involved in that daily activity.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.480]   So the benefits of this are that you get a much closer relationship with the child with
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:42.160]   a loving adult and you get the child's needs met.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   So why don't people do that in every situation?
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:54.840]   Well, it's obvious that because of the high cost of maintaining a one-on-one relationship,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:01.240]   then it's just not feasible for anybody except those who are genuinely wealthy.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.000]   So thus you have the emergence of daycare.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.040]   Daycare is a special—it takes advantage of the division of labor.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:14.280]   It says, "How can we find a caregiver who can provide good care for children, but how
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.680]   can we get the ratio up high enough that this can be feasible for most people?"
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.240]   If you recognize that the amount—so let's say you have a mother and a father who are
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.440]   working and earning a median wage each of them.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.760]   Well, it doesn't make any sense for a mother and a father to each earn a median wage.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   Let's say it's $55,000 a year.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.020]   So you have a household income of $110,000.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.640]   It doesn't make any sense for the mother and the father to keep going and earning that
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:49.240]   $55,000 per year pre-tax if they have to turn around and make a $55,000 non-tax-advantaged
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   expense on paying someone else a salary to care for their child.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.800]   It just doesn't make a lot of sense, which is why, in addition to all of the personal
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.520]   reasons, from a financial perspective, you say, "Okay, well, mother will stay home.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   Sometimes father will stay home, and we'll take care of the children."
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   So a daycare seeks to expand that.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.240]   And so you can have different levels, right?
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.880]   If you've looked, I'm sure you have, looked at daycare, you'll have very expensive daycare,
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   you'll have very inexpensive daycare.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880]   What are the factors?
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.660]   Well, one factor is the child's, the class size to adult supervisor.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.860]   If you have 30 children and to one adult, you clearly can get the cost down, but now
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.600]   you wonder, "Can the care be provided be as good as I want?"
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.380]   It's better to have five children to one adult, generally speaking, than 30 to one.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.580]   Another thing can be facilities.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   Is there a better facility?
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.240]   Well, that has to be paid for.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.200]   Other things would include, are there other opportunities, right?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.340]   Maybe I want to enroll my child in a Chinese daycare because now my child can learn Chinese
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.340]   from an infant.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.520]   That's a great, great reason to use a Chinese daycare instead of providing your own English-speaking
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.660]   au pair.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.960]   But when you put this all down, if you have money, I think a lot of times you're going
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:10.140]   to wind up in the situation where you say, "I'd like to have somebody in my home so that
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.000]   way it's not like my children are away from my home."
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.320]   Obviously, even with recent events, that can inspire certain levels of concern to know
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.400]   that your children are in another place that may not be as safe as your home.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.740]   In my home means I can supervise, even if it's out the window from the work office that
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:34.460]   we built in the backyard, at least I can supervise, I can see, I can build more contact with my
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.100]   family because my children are at home.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.300]   So I can be there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.780]   They can nap in their own beds.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.580]   With the exception of social contact, playmates, etc., and with the exception of some special
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:54.540]   education that you can provide, certainly you want your children cared for in your home
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:00.460]   by a full-time caregiver during the hours that you are needed for work.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.660]   And I think it's a great idea.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.780]   And so back to the au pair, yes, you can hire from all around the world, you can hire au
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.780]   pair.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:11.380]   Au pair is just the normal kind of European word for nanny, basically.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.720]   And you can hire people from around the world.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   There are plenty of job boards.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   I've looked at them.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:22.960]   I've looked at them primarily for the purposes of language acquisition to say, "If I'm going
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.020]   to hire an au pair or a nanny and I want someone to care for that, well, if I'm going to teach
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.900]   my children English, I'd just as soon have a Spanish-speaking au pair or nanny or a French-speaking
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.740]   au pair or nanny, etc."
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.960]   So I've looked at it a lot from that perspective.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.980]   And I think that if you can do it and if you have the house space where it works, where
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.740]   you can have a live-in house help, I think it's a wonderful thing to do.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.820]   And it will give you the opportunity for you and your wife to maintain your jobs, your
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.320]   income, and yet have the highest level of confidence that you're providing, the very
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.060]   best childcare that you can.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.660]   And I think there are good arguments being made that in some cases, children are actually
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.660]   better with that.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.660]   Right?
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.620]   If mom and dad—this is the argument many people make about childcare generally, and
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:14.260]   I think in some cases it is true—that if mom and dad are fresh, if mom and dad aren't
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:20.500]   all the time providing for all of the daily needs, then they can have a better, or at
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:25.100]   least different and sometimes just happier relationship with their children where they're
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:31.780]   less worn out, they're less frazzled from providing for those basic needs.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:40.180]   And so it's a little longer than I intended, but yeah, I think it's great and worth pursuing.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.780]   >>Trevor: Great.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.060]   Yeah, I'm glad you said that.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:51.700]   I wonder, from my preliminary research, we can absolutely afford it, but I kind of was
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.900]   looking at it as a way to try to get the best of both worlds.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.020]   Like I said, my wife really enjoys her career.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.140]   She spent a lot of time in education and in the health pursuit.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:06.260]   And I'm just trying to do what's best for everybody.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.660]   >>Steve: Of course.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.620]   I think it is absolutely an excellent option.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.300]   And you're kind of caught in a situation like that, right?
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.460]   As a husband, if your wife says, "This is something that's important to me.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.940]   I really enjoy my career.
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.900]   It's something that is an important part of my life.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.940]   I want to keep it.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:29.300]   And I don't want to take the sacrifices that are required for me to walk away from a career
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.700]   to provide childcare."
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.900]   And then you look at your own career, you look at your own things, and you say, "This
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.520]   is important to me, and I don't want to walk away from this to provide childcare."
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.420]   And if there's no way that you can make those two things work together, you're going to
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.500]   need some help with childcare.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:53.420]   And so in that situation, I think that absolutely the best thing to do in the early years is
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:51:03.580]   to provide as close to a full-time parent experience as you can.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:10.500]   And having either very close help of a regular babysitter who's a trusted nanny who's there
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:19.620]   every single day, or having a live-in nanny au pair servant is the best way to do it.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:25.580]   And I would just say that go ahead and use it as an opportunity to look for ways to help
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   your children.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:32.340]   So, like, for example, I wouldn't—unless there was somebody that you just loved, loved,
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:39.640]   loved, because they were a wonderful childcare provider, I would not necessarily look for
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   an English speaker.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.140]   I would look for someone who speaks another language.
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.180]   Why not?
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:50.500]   I would look for somebody who has skills that are going to add to the family.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:57.540]   I have a maid who comes to my house right now five days a week.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:04.060]   She cleans, she does some of the cooking, she helps with some childcare, and it really
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.260]   does add a lot.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:12.240]   And so it allows me to help, it allows me to make sure that my family has—that we
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.200]   have what we need.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.120]   My wife is less burdened because she's freed up from a lot of those other things that freeze
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.020]   her to focus on higher-level activities.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:27.400]   That frees her up and keeps her from being stressed out and tired with all of the—with
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.160]   work, etc.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.160]   And it—but yet allows me to feel really confident because my children are still in
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:40.500]   a totally safe, totally cared-for environment where they're in my home, right?
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.860]   They're on my property.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.060]   I know where they are.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.540]   I'm not worried about the influences that they're under.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.820]   They're not—they didn't just get stuck in a daycare where they flip on the TV and just
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.700]   watch movies all day.
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:58.380]   I can provide the very best of both worlds because I have the financial resources, and
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.380]   you do too.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.380]   So it's a wonderful decision.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.900]   And if it works out for the wife and if you can find someone excellent, I think it's
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:05.900]   great.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   All right.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   Thanks so much, Joshua.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.060]   And it's interesting that you brought up the language thing too because that had crossed
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.060]   my mind.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.900]   I thought, "Well, maybe we can get even more out of this than just some help."
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.260]   So I appreciate your insight.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.260]   Right.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:21.260]   And I think there are, depending—so depending on the rates, there are very highly qualified
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:24.260]   people who aren't just bodies.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:28.900]   So let's say that you were—I don't know your financial condition, but let's say you're
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.100]   making $50 million a year.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:34.740]   You wouldn't just go and hire some 18-year-old girl.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.820]   You would go and you would hire a very highly qualified, very competent governess for your
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.980]   home.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:46.780]   And so we might joke at Mary Poppins movies or—but that's what you're looking for.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.860]   You're looking for a very highly qualified professional, professional childcare provider,
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:57.560]   somebody who is going to provide the environment for your child.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.740]   And so what I would say is in the beginning, you're looking for, of course, childcare.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.260]   Childcare is a special skill that some people are really skilled at.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.800]   Some people are really good at.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.500]   And those people have the ability to provide—they're patient.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.540]   They're good at working with babies, good at working with children.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.060]   And I would look for people who are going to do what you want done for your children.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:27.380]   If I'm hiring an au pair, right, during those hours, we're not going to just put on cartoons
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.700]   and play it for the children.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.980]   We're going to be reading to the children.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.660]   We're going to be playing with the children.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:36.260]   And this is so important in the baby years because in those first few years, that's where
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.060]   you're having vocabulary development.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.380]   That's where you're having kind of worldview shaping, etc.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:46.260]   As your child grows older, if you continue with this, then I think that's where you can
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.660]   start to bring in specialized tutors.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:53.180]   And so I've said this before when talking about homeschooling, but if I come to a place
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:57.020]   where I can't run my business effectively with homeschooling, if my wife can't pursue
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:02.460]   her lifestyle with homeschooling, I'll bring in a professional tutor.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:08.220]   I'll bring in somebody who is responsible and tutors my children in our home.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.980]   And I'm always going to look at the options that are available, right?
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:16.620]   Once you get to school age, now all of a sudden you have a much bigger world that's tailored
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.520]   where you can use the division of labor and the benefits of that to give the best things
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.700]   to your child.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.020]   But even in those early years, look for somebody with capacity, look for somebody with professional
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.260]   qualifications.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.660]   And look for something excellent.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.980]   Make it something really, really positive and good in your family.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.980]   Great.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.980]   Will do.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.500]   And just selfishly, the thing that I would be most excited about is my day is pretty
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   flexible.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   So I love it when he's at the house, even if I'm working, because I can just go check
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   in and I can't really do that at daycare.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:56.380]   And especially if you have a, so I'll just, I'll finish with this, like, here's how my
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:00.460]   day works right now and how I'm currently dealing with these things.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.460]   I work from home.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.180]   I work a pretty good, healthy work week.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:10.220]   Most of my work, though, doesn't necessarily require perfect silence and very little of
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.220]   it is scheduled.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:16.020]   I work hard to keep my schedule free of, I don't like appointments on my schedule.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.020]   So I have a good bit of flexibility.
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.220]   So I get up in the morning.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.820]   I usually will work early in the morning.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.620]   I read a lot early in the morning.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:23.620]   My children wake up.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.900]   I usually am up about by five.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.580]   Children wake up five thirty to six.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.480]   They play a little bit while I read.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.700]   They play.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.700]   And then we have breakfast.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.700]   So I breakfast with them.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:39.700]   Then I go and I work in, it's on our property, but I work in an outbuilding where I have
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.460]   an office and I go out and I start working.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.820]   Right now, my eldest son does homeschool.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:50.500]   And so from eight to twelve, he's in my office at a desk right next to mine.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.820]   That's been hard because it's impacted my day, but it's something that's important to
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.820]   me.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:57:00.260]   He can't focus when I'm doing, when I'm making calls or when I'm doing things.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.820]   And so I have to be careful not to schedule anything that's going to require me to make
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.560]   noise during that time.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.780]   But I get to homeschool him.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.740]   And then my other children are at the house with my wife and with our nanny housekeeper
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.820]   as well.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.140]   And then I go home for lunch.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.580]   I walk across the yard.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.580]   I'm there.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.460]   I have lunch and then I go back to work and I work in the afternoon.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.420]   In the afternoon, I can usually see the children playing outside.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.580]   They're playing in the grass.
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.900]   I can see them.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.680]   Sometimes you hear them in the microphone.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.140]   That's often when I record.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.940]   And then in the evening, I walk home and I'm there for dinner at 530 and I'm with them
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:34.940]   for the evening.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:43.040]   And so my wife doesn't have her own independent income generating career that she pursues,
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.940]   but she could be doing the same thing and we could be getting good results.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.700]   So it is a really gratifying lifestyle.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:54.540]   And then if you have the flexibility to do that, it's really great.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.540]   I love it.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.940]   So as someone who is doing that right now, I strongly encourage you.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:04.340]   I think it's a great option and a really wonderful way for you to make sure that you and your
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:08.480]   wife can maintain the careers that you have while also providing a very, very high level
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.780]   of care for your children, which is awesome.
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   All right.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.860]   Thanks for walking me through your day.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.180]   That's pretty much what I had envisioned too.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:18.740]   It's as cool as it's cool.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.780]   It's what I dreamed years ago and I'm very fortunate to have been able to do it.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:23.780]   Mike in Colorado, welcome to the show.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:28.020]   How can I serve you today?
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.380]   Mike in Colorado, you're up.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.380]   Going once.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.660]   I'll come back to you in a few minutes, Mike.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.700]   Let's go to Austin in Louisiana.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.220]   Austin, welcome to the show.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.780]   How can I serve you today?
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:41.780]   Hey Joshua.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:45.860]   First, I guess I wanted to give a little bit of a testimonial.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.140]   Then I had a question.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.060]   I just wanted to, I had a really good experience last year.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:56.780]   I was actually able to acquire a rental property using some of the lessons that I learned in
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.380]   your credit card course.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:04.220]   And so now I'm at the point where I've actually renovated that property and it's time for
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:09.420]   me to pull my capital out to go on to some new projects.
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:16.860]   I was wondering if you had any thoughts in terms of putting a line of credit on that
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:23.940]   property versus doing a cash out refinance for somebody that's looking to get, I guess
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:28.040]   take on more leveraged debt to grow their portfolio.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.940]   You had preference for one or the other.
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.620]   In that situation, it primarily depends on the terms.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:39.580]   So it's very much going to depend upon what kind of terms can you get for the financing
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.700]   of the property.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:48.740]   Terms of the interest rate, terms of costs of loan inception, closing costs, and then
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.820]   whether, and then what you think you'll be doing on an ongoing basis.
[00:59:53.820 --> 01:00:00.540]   So a line of credit is best used as a form of flexible financing.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:04.820]   You can increase the balance, you can decrease the balance, and it's just a wonderful flexible
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.820]   tool.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:12.100]   Generally going to be, I want to be very careful because I don't have current numbers or even
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.980]   what's been offered to you, but you're going to pay lower terms and you can put it in,
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.980]   take it out anytime.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:24.460]   There's a minor risk with a line of credit that they can reduce your credit line.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.820]   On property this happens less, but you know, like I talked about in the credit card course,
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:34.300]   if you have high credit card balances, then your credit card issuers can turn around and
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.100]   reduce your available credit at any time.
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.460]   And they can do that on a line of credit as well.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:45.900]   This caused a lot of people tremendous heartbreak in 2008 when their lines of credit were reduced
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.100]   massively and they were planning to depend on them.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.780]   So if you do a cash out refi, you avoid that.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.340]   Cash out refi, the problem is what am I going to do with the money?
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.500]   And do I really want this and do I want it at the terms?
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.460]   And so I don't have a strong preference for one or the other.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:01.100]   I would just say that it should be fairly evident once you think about what you want
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:05.340]   to use the money on and once you review the terms of the loan offers that are being made
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.340]   to you.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.340]   Okay.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:14.740]   I guess what I'm looking at is I'm kind of looking to double down on my portfolio.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.780]   I've scaled up to three rental houses in the last year and a half.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:25.660]   So I'm looking to as quickly as I can, you know, scale that up to about six or seven
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.220]   units over the next year to year and a half.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.220]   Right.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.220]   That's kind of what I'm looking at.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.580]   So I'm looking to deploy all the capital that I would be able to get out of the unit.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:39.940]   So how much will they loan you on a cash out refi?
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:48.660]   So I've got all said and done, I'm into the property for about 60 and it'll probably appraise
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:55.060]   for approximately 120 and they're going to give me 75%.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:00.180]   And have you gotten an offer of how much of a line of credit they'll give you either without
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:08.060]   that loan or with a line of credit on top of the first mortgage?
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:14.380]   So I've just looked at doing a line of credit on the appraised value of the house since
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.340]   I own the home free and clear at this point.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.820]   So it's the same terms.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.220]   Well basically they're still willing to give 75% of the appraised value.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   The big difference being obviously the cash out refi is a 30 year term and the line of
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.620]   credit is a five year term.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:40.960]   So I think in that situation, I won't say obvious, but I would think very strongly the
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.980]   weight would be to do a traditional cash out refi because number one, you'll be able to
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.100]   lock in your terms, you'll have a known sum of money that you can use, you'll lock in
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:57.440]   your terms and you'll have a very long amortization period at what's probably going to be a favorable
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.020]   interest rate.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.980]   Obviously we don't know what will happen with interest rates, but the interest rate on your
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:07.220]   line of credit will probably be a floating interest rate, whereas whatever they offer
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.660]   you on this particular 30 year mortgage will be fixed.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.460]   If rates go down, you can refinance and you can reduce your costs.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.180]   If rates go up, you've fixed it and you've stretched out your repayment period to the
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:24.020]   longest period possible, which keeps you in the maximum margin of safety.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:31.180]   So I think from what you're describing, I would do a cash out refi to lock those terms
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:36.420]   in so that I can make maximum use of the money, I can predict my cash flow needs in the future
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.300]   and I can continue to grow my portfolio aggressively.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   Awesome.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.580]   I appreciate the perspective.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580]   My pleasure.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.460]   All right, we move on to Mark.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.460]   Mark welcome to the show.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.460]   How can I serve you today?
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.460]   Hi Joshua.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.500]   Thank you for taking my call.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:04:00.780]   I'm considering a career change into the financial services industry and I've interviewed with
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:08.540]   a firm and I'm also going to be meeting with another one in the near future.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:16.340]   And I'm just trying to get your input as to what I should be looking for to kind of
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:23.020]   compare the two and see overall which would be a better fit.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.940]   So the first thing I would say is probably you shouldn't be doing two interviews, you
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.140]   should probably be doing 10.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.580]   And the reason I say that is remember this, the financial services industry, and of course
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:42.340]   that's a big term, but if you are looking for some kind of sales role, some kind of
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:47.780]   producer role, something where you're going to go out and get customers, which encompasses
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:52.820]   a wide swath of the financial services industry that includes insurance agents, that includes
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   financial advisors, if you're doing something where you're going to be going getting customers,
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   remember that this is something that all of the companies are recruiting for actively.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:10.820]   Now not all firms have as big of a recruiting budget as others, but they're recruiting actively.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:16.580]   And so it's less a matter of there's a limited number of jobs and too many candidates and
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:20.360]   so I just got to get my foot in the door and it's much more a matter of there are plenty
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.820]   of jobs and they're trying to pull the best candidates to them.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.860]   And so one of the best things you can do is before you're actually committed or entrenched
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.620]   in any company is go around and interview widely.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:40.740]   And so usually I give the advice to make a list of all of the different types of financial
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:47.020]   services positions that you know of that either you may or may not be interested in and then
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.620]   go and interview for those.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:54.860]   So for example, I would interview with a life insurance company, I would interview, and
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.580]   I would even do this, I would interview with a big name brand life insurance company and
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.420]   I would find a local independent life insurance agent and interview.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.900]   I would interview with a property and casualty insurance company, I would interview with
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:13.180]   a big name brand property and casualty insurance company and with a local independent PNC company.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:21.740]   I would interview with a big traditional wire house financial planning firm and I would
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.980]   interview with a smaller more local boutique financial planning firm.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:30.900]   I would interview with anybody and I would probably, depending on the direction, I would
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.860]   try to find various flavors of those companies.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.780]   And so if you go around and you interview, then each one of them will make you a different
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   kind of offer.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:46.500]   Say here are the kinds of packages that we offer and you'll find out, hey, company A
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:53.420]   offers a salary of zero dollars but they predict their normal earnings are X.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:58.300]   Or company B, they'll give me a salary of $85,000 but then they'll pay me this.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.880]   And so you get an idea of what their options are.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.700]   And then my question, my secret question, which I'll give you here, is simply this.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:11.380]   What I love to do is ask people, okay, if you weren't with this company, what would
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.460]   you do?
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:18.460]   If you weren't with this, if you weren't, you know, dear Mr. Property and Casualty Agent,
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.940]   you're running here this big firm, you're making $700,000 a year but if you weren't
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.060]   with this company, what would you do?
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.420]   And get an idea of what people say.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.820]   And then use that for your second round and go and pursue interviews with those companies
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.200]   and try to find out what the options are.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.780]   So that's my first piece of advice, not having heard anything about the two particular options
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.820]   you are, is that you can probably answer this by interviewing more widely.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:51.340]   And I think that interviewing widely is something that people don't do enough of.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.580]   And there's no reason not to.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.020]   Okay.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:01.140]   Yeah, I appreciate that input.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:06.780]   As a follow-up, you know, we may potentially be heading into a recession.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:13.180]   What are your thoughts about transitioning into financial services industry during a
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.420]   potential recession?
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.740]   I don't know if you worked during the '08, '09 recession.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:23.580]   I began my career in financial services in the fall of 2008.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:32.580]   I was laid off from my job in about May or June, I think it was May of 2008.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.500]   I spent several months goofing around.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.820]   I went and took a trip across the United States.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.140]   I traveled a good bit.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:43.180]   And I came back and I started getting serious about job hunting after about three months
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.340]   or so.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.780]   I signed my contract in the financial services industry.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:53.380]   I would guess something like September or October of 2008.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:56.580]   Started my licensing and doing my classes, etc.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:02.740]   I remember vividly, because I was driving to Miami every day to go to my insurance license
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:07.060]   class to get my life health and annuities license.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.300]   And I remember vividly listening to NPR.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:17.820]   I would listen every day to NPR and to All Things Considered and also the Marketplace.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:24.220]   I remember driving up every day from Miami to West Palm Beach listening to Marketplace
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:28.580]   every day on NPR with them talking about the bailout package.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.340]   This was TARP and whatnot.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   So then that was my first month in the business was immediately following that.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.100]   But I learned from it.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:49.100]   My entire career was built in a frame of declining interest rates on fixed income investments,
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:55.340]   which is inconvenient when you sell life insurance because life insurance, whole life insurance
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.820]   with cash values is connected to fixed income rates.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.500]   And so every single year the dividend rate, the dividend crediting rate on life insurance
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.820]   policies was going down.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:12.020]   And then we had a great run in the stock market for a time, but various levels of uncertainty.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.780]   So all that to say though that I've been there, done it.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.020]   And in hindsight, I would do it again.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.060]   The thing I've often wondered, which is what you're dealing with right now.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:28.220]   In hindsight, I came to view getting laid off as a blessing because I realized that
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:34.280]   if I had waited until I was ready, I had been planning to leave the job that I got laid
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.140]   off of, I was planning to leave at the end of the year in January of 2009 and go do something
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.140]   else.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.980]   I didn't like the job, didn't want to do it anymore.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.300]   But in hindsight, I don't know if I would have had the courage to go in January of 2009
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.460]   because I would have told myself, oh, there's a recession on, jobs are tight, there's too
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.140]   many unemployed people, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:58.900]   And so I think that it was a blessing in disguise.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:07.640]   I think you can build a career in financial services in any market.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.900]   And there are a couple of important reasons for you to understand why.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:17.040]   Number one, generally in financial services, you are generally serving the wealthy.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.200]   And I believe that serving the wealthy is one of the best things that you can do to
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.640]   be protected against market swings in the economy.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:34.560]   People who are wealthy are not affected in a significant way by short-term fluctuations
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.280]   in the economy large.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.200]   Obviously, there are industries that are affected.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:47.040]   If your entire NFT portfolio fell apart or all of your crypto portfolio completely collapsed
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.900]   in the last month, you may have had a US dollar token value of $60 million and now you're
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   down to $10.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.280]   Well, that's going to affect a lot of people.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.920]   But generally speaking, it's just not that big of a deal for the wealthy to go through
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.400]   fluctuations.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.440]   And so if you're serving the wealthy, the wealthy aren't like, okay, so stock market
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440]   went down 20%.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440]   Big deal, right?
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.480]   It's just not that big of a deal when you're wealthy.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.200]   It seems like a big deal to a lot of people, but it's not that big of a deal.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.040]   And so wealthy people always have money.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.920]   And they're always willing to listen to people who will help them make money.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.280]   And so while you might have fewer clients to some degree, it's just not that big of
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.320]   a deal.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.480]   Number two is if the industry that you're choosing has some kind of opportunity.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.560]   And let me, because I got to carve this out here.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.040]   In some roles in the financial services industry, you will exclusively serve the wealthy.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.840]   So as an example would be, let's say that you're going to try to build a money management
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.560]   business and your account minimums that are set by your firm are a million dollars.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.720]   Well, the guy with a million dollars, if his account value goes down, because there's a
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.600]   recession on and he goes down to 800,000, you could probably still prospect him.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.320]   And there's plenty of other guys with an account value of 1.3 million where their account went
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320]   down.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   It's just not that big of a deal.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.700]   We're not dealing with people who have $20,000 in a Roth IRA if you have million dollar minimums.
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.880]   People with million dollars in their accounts, it's just not going to make that big of a
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.480]   difference in the short term.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.360]   On the other hand, there are certain expressions of the financial services industry where you
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360]   sell more products.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   Right?
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.360]   So when I started, I sold life insurance.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.840]   I sold life insurance, disability insurance, long term care insurance.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:37.400]   Well, a recession is not bad for that business in any way, shape or form.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.560]   Are there people who have, who are losing their jobs?
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.360]   Of course there are.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.720]   But the number of people who are losing their jobs is a few percent of the economy.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.720]   Right?
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.320]   So let me give you some numbers to put this into context.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.440]   There are a few percent of the potential prospects and targets out there.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.280]   So let's say that unemployment goes up by 2%.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.320]   When I was selling life insurance agents, not agents, when I was selling life insurance,
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.560]   we had a pretty intense model.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.360]   So I would see on average about 15 people a week.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.600]   Higher if I could manage it, lower was bad, but 15 people a week.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:25.280]   So that means that over the course, if I'm doing 15 people a week, in order for me to
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:32.740]   see 100 people and offer to sell them life insurance, it takes me 6.67 weeks.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:39.560]   That means that over the course of 6.67 weeks, almost, let's call it 7 weeks, there are 2
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:50.200]   fewer people who can buy life insurance from me out of 100 versus before the recession.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.000]   And what's more important is that I always have the choice to just weed those people
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   out.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.840]   So if I get to someone's kitchen table or they walk in the office and they're totally
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.400]   broke and have no money and they don't have a job because they got laid off in the recession
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.840]   and everything is collapsing, if I can't help them, then I say, "I'm sorry, I can't help
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   you.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.040]   I used to carry around Dave Ramsey books.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.160]   Here, read Dave Ramsey's book.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160]   He can help you.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.480]   I can't, but call me when, I'll call you next year."
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.000]   And so the point is it just doesn't matter.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.260]   2% increase in unemployment doesn't matter.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:29.260]   And then if you start to work in the groups that most of the time we work in as people
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.080]   in the financial services industry, it's just not effective the same way.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.520]   If your normal client is an attorney, maybe a mid-level attorney, and that's your starting
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.680]   client that you're trying to work with or a business owner, just most of the time, these
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:48.560]   professions are insulated from those economic worries.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.560]   So what are the industries you got to be careful of?
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.120]   Well, let's say the mortgage industry.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.080]   Right now the mortgage industry is falling apart because there's been massive business
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:04.580]   done by all kinds of companies due to just a continual flow of refinancing leads.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:10.160]   But if you're either in that now people can't refinance and save a bunch of money, so you're
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.420]   reliant on new mortgage inception in order to sell to, or if you have a business serving
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:19.020]   mortgage brokers, now you've got real trouble right now.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:25.280]   So if you're in the financial service industry in an area where that is facing the general
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.920]   public, then something like a recession can really pull you apart.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.640]   But in most cases, it just doesn't really matter because it's just a couple people who
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.600]   can't buy something from you that could before, and you can control that.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.040]   You can quickly weed that out with activity, with your own hustle.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.440]   There's plenty of money, there's plenty of people, there's plenty of people that need
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.920]   help, there's plenty of people that their business went broke and they want to buy more
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.160]   life insurance because now they don't have as much money as they did.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.960]   There's plenty of people who hate their financial advisor who just lost 30% and they want to
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.120]   try someone new.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.720]   I just don't think it matters.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720]   Okay.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.760]   Well, thank you.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:11.840]   I appreciate your input and I'm looking forward to seeing how things play out.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.840]   Anything else?
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.440]   No, I think that's it.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.080]   Appreciate it.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.440]   And we go to Bradley in California.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   Bradley, welcome to the show.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.440]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:29.120]   I'm calling because I've been making some considerations about changing my career path
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:35.320]   and there's a really small startup that I've been interested in working with for about
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.720]   the last three years now.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.320]   And they've been interested in taking me on to do sales for them and possibly some coaching.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   The problem is essentially to bring me on, I would first need to bring them sales so
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.240]   they can't offer me any kind of salary or anything without first bringing them sales
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.480]   to prove that it's going to be viable for them.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.840]   And I'm really confident that this is going to be a successful growing business and it
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.720]   has been for the last few years.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.760]   Just not enough to expand their staff.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.520]   But to do that, I wouldn't be provided any leads or any marketing.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.360]   So essentially I have to be sales marketing all in one.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.160]   Now again, I do believe in the business and I'm just wondering if it's crazy for me to
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.600]   go out and try to do my own marketing and try and spend my own money to bring business
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.240]   into a company that I don't even work for.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.240]   Right.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.800]   Do you have any experience in sales or marketing?
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.800]   I do.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.700]   Not in marketing, but in sales, yes.
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:46.080]   So you have gone out, found customers, sold those customers and consummated transactions
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.160]   and you've done it for more than a short period of time.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.240]   Only for about three years, but enough to where I feel confident in it.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:02.240]   And I have brought them some business already, but that's more through my personal network.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.920]   But I am confident that this is a product or really it's a service that I could sell.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.020]   Yes.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:14.520]   Is there a way that you could test this on the side while keeping your current job?
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.520]   Yes, there is.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.240]   Then I would do that.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.880]   I don't see any downside.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.480]   If you have some experience in sales, you know how to pick up the phone and go and see
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.020]   someone and sell them the thing that you have to sell them.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.020]   That's important.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.220]   If you believe in the product, that's important.
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:38.120]   And if you have the ability to test it in some way without jumping full on and burning
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.040]   bridges at your current opportunity, then the only downside would be what you said about
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.360]   the need to spend money or the idea of spending money.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.040]   And so we could talk about that separately.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.680]   So setting aside the issue of how much money you would invest into this opportunity, what's
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:01.080]   the downside to testing it on the side until you feel confident enough to take the jump?
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.960]   Well, I guess I should say I did test that for a while.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.120]   There was a way for me to try to bring in sales without paid marketing and I did test
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.120]   that.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.720]   But it didn't prove as fruitful as I thought it might be.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   And I guess the downside of doing that was that was very, because it was all very, you
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.560]   know, it wasn't passive marketing where people were coming to me.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.560]   I was going out.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.600]   It was very active and that took a lot of time away from my family, my primary job.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600]   Of course.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600]   Okay.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.040]   So then it sounds like the key question is actually the money.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.360]   Would it be crazy for me to spend money out of my own pocket to try to test to see if
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.000]   this other thing would work given that I'm spending money out of my own pocket for a
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.920]   company that hasn't actually even hired me?
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.920]   Is that the question?
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:48.920]   Yes.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920]   Okay.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:56.640]   How much money would you need to invest in order for you to feel like you had done some
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.760]   amount of marketing to prove the concept?
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   Right?
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760]   How much are we talking?
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.840]   I don't think it would be substantial.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:11.120]   I think, you know, even something simple like a Google AdWords campaign, maybe somewhere
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.640]   between five to $10,000.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   Okay.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.200]   Nothing, but not going to break me by any means.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.720]   And how much are you earning right now?
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.640]   A hundred thousand plus bonuses.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.920]   So five to $10,000 is something like five to 10% of your annual income, a little bit
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.920]   less if we include bonuses.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.160]   How much is your current net worth?
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   $150,000.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160]   $150,000.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:47.000]   So this is five to 10% also of your, or less, sorry, five to 7% of your net worth.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   Okay.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.200]   And if you invested this money, what's your guess?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.880]   Notice I said guess.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.680]   What's your guess of how much that could generate?
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.960]   If it were successful, what's your guess of how much it could generate for you in terms
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   of commissions?
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:09.000]   Well, I don't know because I guess, you know, that commission rate has been established
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.560]   because this is all very new to them.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.600]   But I do know, you know, for every one client I bring on, that's going to bring them somewhere
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.840]   between $1,500 to $3,500 of revenue.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:29.920]   And you know, not a very time intensive or resource intensive business.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.120]   So the margins are pretty big.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.720]   So I would say pretty good on each client that I would be able to attract.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:40.040]   Now how much I can get from this kind of marketing, I really don't know.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.040]   But even a couple clients would be enough for me to make it well worth my time and to
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.360]   recoup my whole investment.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.560]   Right.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.920]   So and let's say that your dream scenario, let's say that everything was successful,
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:01.360]   the marketing was successful, and you just, this thing went amazingly well and you said
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.560]   I'm all in, you went all in, you went and worked with the company.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.320]   Give me a guess of a dream scenario of how much you could earn as a full time sales and
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.040]   marketing guy with this company.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.880]   I have no doubt that even, you know, bringing in, that was even getting like 10 clients
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   per month, which is very doable and they can easily handle right now.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   It could be a couple hundred thousand dollars per year or more.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:34.800]   So as far as I'm concerned, this is a risk that is very much within your, within the
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.760]   kind of thing that you should do.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.160]   This is five to ten thousand dollars.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:44.540]   If, if you could test it successfully on five to ten thousand dollars, this is a modest
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:48.200]   amount of money compared to both your income and your net worth.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.380]   As you said, it's not nothing, but it's a pretty modest amount of money.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:58.640]   And if on the other side of it, you think that, that potentially there's a business
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.780]   where I could be making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, then it seems like the kind
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.420]   of thing that is definitely worth testing.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:11.300]   If I gave you the offer and I said, listen, if you'll give me today ten thousand dollars,
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.960]   then in say 18 months, I could give you, I could double your income.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.460]   Instead of you making a hundred grand, you could make 200 grand.
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:20.840]   That sounds like a pretty good offer, right?
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.120]   It certainly does.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.720]   So if I, if I could say, invest into me as a career coach, or I'm going to be a personal
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.040]   style coach, I'm going to train you on how, I'm going to be your personal advisor in some
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.500]   manner and you invest at ten thousand dollars into me.
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:40.400]   And then at the light at the other end of the tunnel was, hey, we could potentially
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   double your income.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.800]   That just seems like a pretty good bet to make.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:48.240]   And so I think it's, it's not, it's not your life savings.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.040]   It's a, it's a modest portion.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.360]   So I would just sketch out, okay, how is it going to feel if I lose ten thousand dollars
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.960]   and I don't sell anything?
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.760]   How would that feel?
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.360]   And get clear on that.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.920]   Then once that's clear, then I would go back and I would say, how can I mitigate the risk?
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.340]   And so here are just two ideas, both of them fairly obvious.
[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:15.220]   Idea number one is make sure that in your purchasing of the marketing and whatnot, you
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:20.020]   go slow and you make sure your funnels are working before you really go in and invest
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.100]   big time into it.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.580]   That's the first thing.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:27.300]   Then idea number two is I would go back to the company and say, tell you what, I'll put
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.420]   in five grand, you put in five grand.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.020]   That way we have a full budget and we know we can test it.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.020]   I'll put in five grand of my own money.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.260]   That's how much I believe in it.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.480]   You put in five grand from the company money.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.760]   You match me dollar for dollar and then let's test these ideas that I have for marketing
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.140]   and sales and then see how it goes.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:49.180]   I would think that the company could put up a few thousand dollars, right?
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:52.540]   >> Steven: Certainly, yeah.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:58.960]   >> Tom: If they have a service that's generating that amount of revenue, even if they aren't
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.340]   willing to hire somebody at a hundred thousand dollars a year to work for them, I would think
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.980]   they could pretty easily write a check for five grand to do it.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.460]   I would think that would be a good test for you to say, are they actually going to treat
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.460]   me fair?
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:22.660]   I can imagine and envision a good high quality startup that the founders are just overwhelmed,
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:25.900]   they can't hire anyone, they're not good at managing.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:31.140]   I can imagine them not wanting to hire somebody and make an actual job offer, actual employees,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.140]   etc.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:37.260]   I can't imagine them coming along and saying, "We're not willing to pay five grand to somebody
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:42.420]   who's already sent business our way and somebody who's willing to put up five grand of his
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.620]   own money for an opportunity that's actually not even sketched out in detail yet."
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:50.220]   I can't imagine them not being willing to do that.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.220]   I think that you could get them to put in five grand, you risk five grand, and I think
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:58.140]   it's a great bet to make.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:05.620]   I don't know why I'm so hesitant about it.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.060]   Have you ever done anything like that?
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:12.020]   Have you ever just taken a risk on yourself and your abilities?
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:19.340]   No, I think maybe I've taken more risk on my traditional 9-5 career path, moving companies
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.980]   and industries and things like that.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:25.780]   This is just a little bit outside the purview of what I've done, but I don't know, the upside
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.860]   is too hard to ignore.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.300]   I'm firmly convicted that this is a great business.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.380]   They have a great business.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.100]   I believe in what they do.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:43.820]   I'm 110% in with it and I know if we can get in front of people that it's going to succeed.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.460]   At least that's what I've made up my mind.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:50.340]   Of course, I can't know for sure, but I am very convicted that it has as good of a chance
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.340]   as anything.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.780]   So from listening to you, without knowing anything about the business, I think you need
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.620]   to do it.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.740]   Because one of the things that, the reason I ask the question is, have you done this
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.940]   before?
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:08.100]   What I have observed and learned from my own mistakes, the times that I've been far too
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:14.580]   hesitant is that being willing to take a risk on yourself and invest in yourself is a skill
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.780]   set that has to be honed.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.060]   I spent too much of my life not doing it because I wasn't taught to do it.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:26.460]   I wasn't trained to do it and I didn't understand my mistake.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:32.300]   If you aren't in that accustomed to believing in yourself and following your hunches, following
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.580]   your own convictions, that's something that has to be gotten rid of.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:41.860]   And so if it costs you five grand and it just lights on fire and makes you nothing, but
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:46.620]   you have actually done something that you believed in and I heard what you said, that
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.620]   you believe in this, then I believe for your own self-respect, you need to do it.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:53.620]   Just to say, I believe in this.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:58.100]   Because there's too many opportunities that if we don't cultivate that habit, that skill
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:02.580]   of believing in ourselves, believing in our own discernment, our own judgment and being
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:08.380]   willing to take action on it, no matter how many wonderful opportunities come along, we'll
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.160]   miss them all because we won't ever believe in ourselves.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.360]   But on the flip side, if we cultivate and we believe in ourselves and we say, I see
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:22.120]   this, I'm going to do this thing, even if it turns out to fail, that's the basic skill
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.080]   that we have to do in order to succeed.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.860]   And so I would rather you take this action, lose five grand.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.520]   Six months from now, you find something else.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.600]   Take action, lose five grand.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.920]   Six months from now, do something else.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.000]   Take action, lose 10 grand.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.320]   But then the fourth time around or maybe the 40th time around, the taking action is where
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.680]   you hit something that flows, that works.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.720]   And so I believe this is a skill that you need to practice and prove to yourself that
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   I'm going to be willing to believe.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.760]   And if this is the opportunity that's in front of you, you believe it.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.480]   And having one of the old sales sayings, that sales is a transfer of belief.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.680]   I think that if you believe in the product, you'll be able to transfer that belief to
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680]   other people.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.760]   And I don't think you're going to lose money and I think you should do it for your own
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.160]   self-respect.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.380]   If you believe in something, you've got to put your money where your mouth is, just for
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.160]   your own self-respect as a man.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:18.400]   It's funny that you say that because I think what's been gnawing away at me for I guess
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.240]   this entire time I've been considering it is not the fear of missing out whatever potential
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.800]   money I'm going to make.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:29.320]   It's really been more about violating my own principles of not going after what I really
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320]   want.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320]   Right.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320]   Right.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320]   Well, thank you, Joshua.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   My pleasure.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.520]   And with that, we end today's Q&A call.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.480]   It's a good note to end on.
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:46.140]   I'm not going to repeat the lesson I just shared there or tried to emphasize, but I
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:52.120]   would say that that is worthy of reflection.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.840]   For me, it's been a big growth thing is that as I have started to believe in myself and
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:04.400]   then to take action on my convictions, even when I have been wrong, I have just been proud
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:09.520]   of myself and I've recognized that it changed me to actually believe in my convictions.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.600]   I want that for you.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.600]   I want that for all of us.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:21.160]   I think we're better served as a people who knows how to believe in ourselves and how
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:26.360]   to press forward and take action when we're uncertain.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.920]   If you look at every great success story, you will find that time at which a man or
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:36.720]   a woman had to step up and say, "Yes, I'm going to make this bet.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.920]   I'm going to take this risk.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:41.560]   I'm going to take my shot," whatever it is.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.840]   And if you get knocked down, it's okay.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:52.400]   That's why I love so much the Man in the Arena poem that when you recognize that character
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:57.000]   trait and you see it lacking in yourself and you start taking action on it, all of a sudden,
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.240]   it just changes how you see other people and you don't see people who are failures.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:07.600]   I lost so many opportunities in too much of my life, but some of my life, thinking, "Oh,
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.200]   if other people will see me do something and I fail, then they'll see me as a failure."
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.880]   And I don't see people who fail as failures anymore.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.840]   As I have been more diligent and consistent about taking action on my beliefs, then I've
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.720]   come to admire and respect people who take action on their beliefs.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.160]   We can't guarantee success.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.280]   We can try to control for it.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.000]   We can try to control risk.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.600]   We cannot guarantee success, but what we can do is we can, on a steady basis, we can focus
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.200]   ourselves on taking shots.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.560]   Take enough shots, you hit some balls.
