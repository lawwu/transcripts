[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780]   So the first step in how I allocate money is what I'll call operating cash,
[00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620]   which involves making sure you have one to two months of your regular expenses
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.160]   sitting in cash right in your checking account.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.100]   But this is not an emergency fund.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.220]   This is not a giant amount of money to solve all these problems.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.960]   It's your cash flow buffer for each month to smooth over the gap
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.440]   between the fact that sometimes you have bills that are due before your income hits
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.900]   and you want to make sure you're not having to go borrow money,
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.360]   transfer money when that happens.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.700]   It also means because it's one to two months that there is a small buffer for some urgent thing
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360]   like a high health insurance deductible, a sudden car repair.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.840]   You want to be able to cover those things without having to dip into your savings.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.400]   So this is your pay your bills.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.020]   Don't get caught off guard fund.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.860]   It's simple.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.820]   It's boring, but it's probably the most practical and essential piece of your framework
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.240]   for how you allocate your money.
