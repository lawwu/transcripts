[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, by a long shot, Easter is my favorite holiday of the year.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And on Sunday, we celebrate that by his resurrection,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Jesus Christ decisively ended the terrible reign of heartbreak and sin in this world.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   There is freedom for those of us who trust in him.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And for those believers, Easter is also a promise that Christ will break us free
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   from the trappings of mediocrity in this world.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is a point John Piper developed in the following excerpt from his 2001 Easter sermon
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   on 1 Corinthians 15, verses 12 to 20. Here's what he said.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I'm banking everything in the rest of this sermon on the fact that
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   there's something in every one of you that has tasted moments where you've said,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   "I don't want to be like the run of the mill, living for myself, making a name for myself,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   making lots of money, just shrinking into a little nuclear family with a nice TV
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   or a big sound system with big screens and a lot of games."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   He who dies with the most toys wins. You know in your best moments, it isn't so.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Here's my question. Paul lived such a life of cutting edge, sacrificial, risk-taking, perilous love.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I want to know how he did it.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Let me just acquaint you for a moment with Paul's life.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Verse 30 in this same chapter, Paul says, "I'm in peril every hour."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He's in danger all the time. Why? He explains in the second letter he wrote to Corinth.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   "I am often in danger of death. Five times I received 39 lashes.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   In dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I have been in labor and hardship through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   often without food, in cold and exposure."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And he asks just a few verses earlier than that paragraph in chapter 11 of 2 Corinthians,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   he says to this community, "Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I love you.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You may not know I love you, but God knows I love you. That's why I choose this life."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So here we have a person doing what we, at our highest moments, long to do,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   namely live on the cutting edge of self-sacrificing love,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and not just constantly thinking about maximizing our own private self-indulgent pleasures.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And now the question is, how do you do that?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   How do you live in peril every hour?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   How do you embrace risk and beatings and imprisonments and shipwrecks?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Why do you make choices, Paul, that put you in harm's way over and over again?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   What is it with you?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   His answer is, "Love? But how is that sustained?"
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Now, let's go back to verse 19.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   "If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   If Christ is not raised, and I'm hoping for a resurrection, I'm stupid, living the life I'm living.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   My life is crazy. My life is insane. My life is foolish. It's pitiable. It's nonsense,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   if I'm not going to be raised with Christ someday."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Do you see? Are you, I'll ask you right now, are you living a life which is stupid if you're not raised from the dead?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Wow! What an indictment of the American church.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   What an indictment of the American church.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   How are your choices? They look like everybody else in the world.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   How much is it costing you to love people?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Hardly anything? Hardly any risks? Hardly any dangers?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Hardly any choices that would be called "imprudent"?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And yet your heart, I believe from God Almighty, written on your heart is,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "Oh God, there's got to be more. There's got to be more.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   There's got to be more than this middle American way of prosperity
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that causes people to get just as sick with mental disease as all the sicknesses in the simple, undeveloped places of the world.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There's got to be more than this."
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And Paul says, "There is more. There is so much more in this life and the next."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You know the great obstacle to living the life you dream about and that God has put in your heart as possible?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's 1 Corinthians 15, 32.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "If the dead are not raised, let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   If you believe, tomorrow we die. That's it. Zero. No resurrection.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You will eat and drink. And you won't care about love.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You won't care about people. You won't take any risks in order to make yourself a means to other people's joy
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   because you're going to maximize your own private pleasures because you've only got one life to do it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But if you've got 10,000 ages of years to do it with a Christ who will never let you be bored,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   this little prelude can be spent directing people to that and taking whatever risks it takes
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   to get them there and you there with maximum joy.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So, I'm done and I'm going to make a closing appeal to you to just think and pray and seek God in this.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   If Christ has not been raised, the Christian life ought to look stupid.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Which means that believing in the resurrection of Christ and of ourselves
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   is the key to the highest, noblest, and in the long run, most joyful life.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Jesus, for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   For the joy that was set before Him beyond the resurrection endured the cross.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Same thing with Him as with us.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And if He has been raised, there is a power in the world and in this room and in the gospel
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   that can lift you, both in this life and the next, to a level of significant living
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   that God has written on your heart as beautiful and right and true.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And almost everybody in this room wants it.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   A few of you have checked out so completely right now, you're not even hearing what I say.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I grieve for you, I pray for you, I long for you.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   But some of you, many of you, are feeling what I'm saying, namely,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   yeah, perhaps those dreams were written by God and perhaps the key that unlocks that dream
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   is the Son of God and is the resurrection of the Son of God
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   and is the freedom that comes from believing in the Son and the resurrection,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   my own resurrection.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Maybe that is the key, and I just urge you to press in on Christ.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Come to Christ. Believe in Christ.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   He is the key. He is the answer.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Amen.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Who else will free you from sin and heartbreak and the trappings of mediocrity?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   This clip was taken from John Piper's Easter sermon from 2001
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   in a sermon titled "Pity Not Them Who Rise with Christ."
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You can download the entire message at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Well, we are going to break for the weekend, this sweet and holy weekend,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   to be reminded of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that frees us from the shackles of worldly contentment.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   From Pastor John and from me and for all of us at Desiring God,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   have a wonderful, worship-filled Easter weekend.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   [END]
