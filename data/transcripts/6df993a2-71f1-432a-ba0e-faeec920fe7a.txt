[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.340]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.980]   in the right direction.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.720]   In this episode, I've asked Dr. Jeremiah Chang to join me so we can talk through the
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.740]   subject of embryonic adoption.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.020]   He'll also be featured in the next episode as well, which I dropped together.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.940]   The reason for these episodes and future episodes with Dr. Chang is very simple.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.780]   There have been so many developments within the area of biotechnology and infertility
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.820]   that we have to stop, breathe, and just ask ourselves before we make use of this new technology.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.720]   What does God's word have to say about all of this?
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.820]   In particular, as Christians who profess belief that life begins at conception, and coupled
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.180]   with that, that life intrinsically has immense value, what are the ramifications of holding
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.820]   to such a view?
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.920]   To explore questions such as these, I want to publish a set of episodes that I'm going
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.300]   to refer to as the Imago Dei series.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.440]   The first episode in the Imago Dei series will cover one man's journey through embryonic
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.140]   adoption.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.040]   These convictions that were developed over time through the word and the spirit.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:18.800]   I hope you find this episode edifying.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:46.880]   Dr. Jeremiah Chang, I asked him to come on to this podcast, I'm going to ask him some
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.960]   questions and this episode is going to cover embryonic adoption, but before we get into
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.720]   some of the more technical things, I want to spend a good portion of this episode just
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.780]   talking about Jeremiah's journey because I know even as I say that word, embryonic adoption,
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.760]   a lot of people won't know what that is, what that means.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   We'll get to that a little later, but before we get to some of the minutiae of that, Jeremiah,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.800]   I want to just start off with you just sharing your journey regarding embryonic adoption.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.640]   Kind of start from the beginning because this is directly related to the doctrine of the
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   conception of life.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.360]   If you can kind of take us back to the beginning, the impetus that started to build some of
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.080]   the convictions that you have today that ultimately led to you adopting an embryo amongst other
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   things.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Take us back to the beginning.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   Absolutely.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.000]   This journey sort of started several years ago, back in maybe around 2019.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I came across a video of some people who were evangelizing, preaching the gospel to men
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.400]   and women going into abortion clinics, seeking to murder their own children through abortion.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.840]   At that moment in time, I had not really considered much about abortion.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   I would say I was most definitely as a Christian would identify as pro-life.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.520]   I definitely affirmed that life began at conception, that God created every child at that moment
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.920]   of conception, and so certainly identified as pro-life.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.280]   But when I saw the video of people preaching the gospel, sharing the gospel with desperation,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.080]   knowing that people were going in to commit a sin of such evil nature, a sin of consequences
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.800]   that could not be reversed, it began to dawn on me the gravity of what's going on.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   I think God opened my heart at that point to the reality of what's happening in our
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.960]   culture and mainly the dehumanizing of unborn children that we see.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.280]   What really struck me was just the reality of what's really happening because as I look
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.360]   around where I live, there's several Planned Parenthoods just really locally within a 10-15
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.240]   minute drive, and to know that in each of these Planned Parenthoods, whether through
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.480]   medications or through surgery, they are slaughtering thousands upon thousands of children, image
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.360]   bearers of God.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360]   That struck a chord with me.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.160]   I think God really convicted me because it made me realize that though I profess to be
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.520]   pro-life, though I profess that these children that had not been born were, in fact, created
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.960]   by Him to be His image bearers, that profession really had no weight to it prior to watching
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.320]   that video.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.040]   I hadn't really given much consideration to the reality of abortion.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   To be honest, I didn't really pray much for these children, for these men and women who
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.600]   are seeking to abort their children.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.240]   It seems that just mere profession was happening where I would profess a certain biblical stance
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.440]   but there would be no real manifestation of that.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.040]   I think God really broke me at that point in my life where I saw how I could hold certain
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.600]   beliefs and yet there would be no real application to that belief or manifestation of that belief.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   When I saw what was happening in our culture and even within the professing church community,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:46.120]   there is a tendency to be influenced by the culture around us that we do see unborn children
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.160]   as somewhat less than fully human.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.760]   There certainly is the reality of unborn children being dehumanized.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.220]   That sort of began this journey of just kind of researching more about what the scriptures
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.040]   were saying with regards to this issue.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.880]   What was God's truth?
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.260]   As I began to research more and study the scriptures, God just reaffirmed the reality
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.640]   that every child is created by Him at the moment of conception.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.120]   Then I began to reflect on the ramifications of that.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.560]   If that's true, that every unborn child is truly a child, then what's happening in our
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.440]   society is horrendous.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.680]   Really words can't describe the gravity of what's happening.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   I think God just showed me just the brokenness of this world in a new way that I had not
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:53.240]   yet known and grew in me a love for these children to rescue them, as Proverbs 24, 11
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.320]   talks about, to deliver those who are being taken away to death and those who are staggering
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.560]   to slaughter.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.920]   That sort of propelled me on this journey to glorify God through the proclamation of
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:17.520]   God's truth in this area and then God sort of led us on this journey of how do we practically
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.580]   apply those realities.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.840]   We became exposed to embryo adoption.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.920]   Carrie had introduced me to a book, a memoir of a family who had adopted through multiple
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   avenues.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.600]   They had adopted internationally, domestically, and then through embryo adoption.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.000]   That was our first real exposure to embryo adoption.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.200]   For me, with a science background, I was intrigued by what was happening.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.880]   That technology would even make this possible.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.760]   To be honest, I had not even heard of embryo adoption before.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   I didn't even know it was a reality, a possibility.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.040]   Being intrigued by the science, that's sort of what made me do more research into embryo
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   adoption.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.880]   As I began to do more research, it was very clear that embryo adoption is really just
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.960]   adoption of a child at their earliest stage of development.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.560]   In its simplest form, that's all it is.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:25.320]   It's simply like any other adoption, just adopting a child in their embryonic stage.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.480]   The reality is there are millions of frozen embryos, frozen children.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.080]   Many of them orphaned, many of them abandoned legally by their biological parents and in
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.600]   need of a womb to continue to live and to grow and to develop so that they could live
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.920]   outside the womb.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   God broke us for this reality that millions of His image-bearers are being frozen, abandoned,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.360]   orphaned.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.800]   The practical application for us was to adopt some of them.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.080]   That's what we ended up doing.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.840]   We went through an agency called the National Embryo Donation Center.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.280]   We connected with them and they held very similar beliefs.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:17.920]   We went ahead and back in September of 2021, we ended up transferring three embryos.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:25.360]   Unfortunately, one did not survive, but we are thankful that two did.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.340]   Gary is pregnant with twins and is due soon to deliver.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:38.120]   We did end up, in our batch of adoption, there were six total embryos.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   Unfortunately, two did not survive the thawing process.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.360]   We do have one more embryo that's kept frozen, but that's sort of where the journey has led
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.200]   us thus far.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:05.360]   It's interesting because for many who develop this conviction, a lot of people will end
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.560]   up, say, going to a Planned Parenthood and sharing the gospel at a Planned Parenthood,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.600]   which actually you do.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:19.240]   As today's recording, you actually did today, joined by some other people.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:26.680]   What's interesting about your journey is that, for you, it didn't stop there.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:34.200]   That would have been great, the fact that you are sharing the gospel at a Planned Parenthood.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:44.920]   You are trying to convince these expectant mothers to not abort their unborn child, at
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.720]   the same time sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.640]   But it also developed in you this conviction for embryos.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.040]   What's interesting is that, you didn't mention this, but I want to go ahead and mention this.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.600]   You have two biological children of your own.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.240]   We have Bible study together, and every other week we're at your house and they're here.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.680]   Even when we're not at your house, we see them and they're beautiful.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:23.840]   Carrie has no issues, you have no issues with respect to your bodies.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.680]   You guys could have continued to have children naturally, however, that wasn't enough in
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   the sense that you and Carrie were convicted to do something more.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.560]   That's what led you on this journey.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:46.000]   I'm saying all this because you and I have had many conversations about this before.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.920]   I want to share that because there are people who go into and who begin to look at alternative
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.360]   ways to build a family.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.480]   A lot of times I think God will use certain circumstances to maybe nudge you in certain
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.240]   directions, which is fine, generally speaking is fine.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.920]   But for you and Carrie, that wasn't the case, meaning you guys could have continued to have
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.760]   children naturally.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.080]   That's been something that's sort of been a great light, so to speak.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.920]   It's been a very compelling testimony.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:37.680]   I remember when I first heard about you and Carrie doing this, it was like, "What?"
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   Right?
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.360]   I mean, it was like, "Huh?
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   What?
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   What?
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   Oh yeah, I've heard of that.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   What is that?"
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.080]   And then you kind of investigate and you dig a little deeper into this and you're like,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.760]   "Whoa, there is a lot here."
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.720]   And according to the biblical worldview, we say embryos, but embryo is just describing
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   the stage of development.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   These are people.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   Right, Jeremiah?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   These are people.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.680]   And I think you told me, we're not exactly sure, but the amount of frozen embryos right
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.360]   now, maybe about a million?
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.920]   And I mean, no one keeps track, but certainly most would say up north of a million.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   North of a million.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.080]   And it's relatively expensive, but the technology is getting more efficient and we're making
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.920]   strides in this area.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.160]   There's a lot of money here.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.000]   So typically where there's a lot of money in a certain technology, there's more investment
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   in it.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.200]   So the chances are it could become cheaper in the future, which would mean that there
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.080]   would be more embryos.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.400]   I mean, if you look at the numbers of those using IVF as a reproductive technology, it's
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:51.760]   growing exponentially and whether or not the number of families willing to adopt grows
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:58.680]   with it is hard to tell, but either way, there is definitely a problem of even the reality
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.160]   of these frozen children even existing.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   Right.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.080]   Yeah, so there is this interesting dichotomy that I see with that.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:18.640]   When you look at traditional adoption agencies, the children who are selected to be adopted
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.700]   prior to that, and rightly so, they have rights.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.240]   You can't just starve them, which is a good thing, obviously, which is a good thing.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   But the embryos that we're talking about do not have rights because they're not considered
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   human.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.920]   They're considered chattel, they're considered property.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.160]   So there's a lot that goes with that.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:47.360]   There's a lot that goes with that worldview and that's part of the reason why so many
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.320]   embryos are created.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.880]   They're not viewed as human beings.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   I know this is something that -
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   Absolutely.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.040]   I mean, completely.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.200]   The dehumanizing of unborn children we see most manifestly and obviously in abortion,
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.760]   but you see it with the treatment of embryos in IVF.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.360]   You see it with how they're commodified.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.480]   You see it with how they're viewed when couples go through IVF.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:25.880]   They're simply treated as objects, as a means to an end, but not life, as God says they
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   are.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:36.080]   Yeah, and it's one of those things where we're born in a world where Roe v. Wade, at least
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.320]   today, is still law.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   And so we live in a world where a huge portion of our country doesn't see unborn children
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   as children.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.700]   But then when you do a sonogram or whatever else, you see the features.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.820]   With embryos, there aren't those humanoid features.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.480]   So it's hard for people to just naturally think of them as embryos.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.400]   It takes a lot more convincing.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   Absolutely.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:13.200]   I mean, even for us, on an emotional level, it's difficult.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:20.320]   We always have to fight against, I know Carrie and I, we had to fight against that tendency
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.720]   of just viewing our emotions as a reflection of reality.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.440]   Because sometimes, we saw the pictures of our embryos, of those frozen children we adopted
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.120]   and they were at five days post-conception, so five days of life.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.080]   We saw pictures of them and they don't look like how our toddlers look, they don't look
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.720]   like how our newborns look.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.000]   But the reality is, we all look like that five days post-conception.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.880]   That's just how human beings looked.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:55.840]   And we had to fight against the tendency to allow our emotional connection to dictate
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   reality.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.240]   The reality is what God says, that these are human beings.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:07.280]   Emotionally, it can be difficult, on an emotional level, in a fallen world, to really bond with
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.200]   them and love them as if you would bond and love with a newborn.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.960]   There certainly is that difference there.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   But it's important for us, we always had to reflect that these are children.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.080]   And that certainly was something that we had to continually pray about and ask for repentance
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   at times in the way we even talked about them at times.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.800]   And so it was a constant struggle because they physically don't appear the same way
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.640]   as how we would, maybe how our culture would say human beings ought to appear.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.920]   It's one of those things where if you don't have a biblical worldview, then it's really
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.800]   arbitrary in terms of who gets to dictate when life begins.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.760]   Does it begin at six weeks?
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.600]   Does it begin at eight weeks?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.240]   Does it begin at 12 weeks?
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:10.720]   What's interesting is, it was even Joe Rogan, I think, he said a couple of weeks ago, he's
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.080]   pro-choice, but even he was like, "Look, when a baby starts to look like a human being,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.440]   some of the pro-life people got something right," or something of that nature.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:29.280]   But when it comes to embryos, they don't look like they're not developed enough to even
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.240]   have arms and legs.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.880]   So we don't view them as human beings, but as you've mentioned, we all started off that
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   way.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.920]   They're seeds.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:47.080]   And so if you think about a tree, everything that is necessary for a tree to grow and to
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.200]   have its roots and the trunk, the robustness of a tree, is contained in that seed.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.640]   The seed is not any less a tree than a tree, except it just needs time and nutrients of
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   that nature.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:07.960]   But in a child, in an embryo, there's a unique DNA package, unlike the mom or the dad, but
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.360]   one that has never been seen before, right?
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   Exactly, yes.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.280]   I mean, that's at the moment of conception, that baby has a unique set of DNA that is
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.960]   distinct from the mother or the father.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   And every other human being, obviously.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.520]   And every other human being, absolutely, yes.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.920]   So it's at that moment, they are a distinct entity.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.560]   And so you have to call it something, right?
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.440]   And God says that that's the moment that He created them.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.280]   Yeah, you know, I want to just pause here for a moment, and I know the people listening
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.600]   to this are mostly Christian, but I want to just share some Bible verses here.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   Isaiah 44, 24 says this, "Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and the One who formed you
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.120]   from the womb, I, the Lord, am the Maker of all things, stretching out heavens by Myself,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.080]   and spreading out the earth alone."
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.480]   Jeremiah 1, 5 says this, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.180]   were born, I consecrated you, I've appointed you as a prophet to the nations."
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:18.440]   Psalm 139, 13, and 16 says this, "For you formed My inward parts, you wove Me in My
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.040]   mother's womb.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.080]   I'll give thanks to you, for I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.160]   Wonderful are your works, and My soul knows it very well.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.440]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.600]   depths of the earth.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.720]   Your eyes have seen My unformed substance, and in your book were all written the days
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.520]   that were ordained for Me, when as yet there was not one of them."
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.680]   But the psalmist here, David says here, in the beginning of the psalm, verse 13, beginning
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:55.440]   of verse 13, he says, "For you formed My inward parts, you wove Me in My mother's womb."
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.160]   So this podcast is not meant to be a defense of life at conception, but at the same time
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.140]   it is appropriate to share some of these verses.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.840]   The Bible is absolutely clear.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:14.240]   I don't know of a single, like an actual sound theologian who disagrees that life begins
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.120]   at conception.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   So the issue is not doctrinally, does life begin at conception.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.760]   Doctrinally speaking, life begins at conception.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.480]   The issue is what is the consequence of that.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.280]   That is the issue.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.820]   So I want to talk a little bit more about some of the details regarding your embryonic
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.820]   adoption.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.220]   You mentioned it, but you adopted a family of six embryos.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220]   Yes.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.940]   And I don't even know this because we've talked about this before, but these six embryos
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   are siblings.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.940]   Is that correct?
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.940]   Absolutely yes.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.940]   Genetic siblings.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.940]   They're genetics.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.520]   And they were, just comment on them a little bit more.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   Sure, yeah.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.160]   So they are of Asian descent.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   They're frozen.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.680]   They're frozen for 10 years.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.840]   And so that's always interesting to think about because they've been technically alive
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.040]   for 10 years, just frozen in time.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:21.560]   And so we have six of them and like I was saying earlier, we did transfer three.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.440]   The reason it came out to three was partly because of the grading process and two unfortunately
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.160]   didn't survive the thaw and so one is left.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.480]   And the thing about embryos is that they can be frozen for a long period of time.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:45.180]   And so a lot of people aren't aware that you can freeze them for essentially, as far as
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.320]   we know, an indefinite period.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:56.920]   And our organization sort of got recognized last year or the year before for transferring
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.640]   a 26 year old, I believe, a 26 year old embryo that was frozen.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.240]   And the mother was I think, 27 years old.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.440]   So had they been born at the same time, they would have really been about a year apart.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.640]   But because of the technology, you know, that obviously wasn't the case.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.760]   So these children, you know, like I say, they are dehumanized in the way we see them and
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.000]   the way we treat them and I think you can see that in just the way that how long some
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.680]   of them have been frozen for.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:38.240]   And that's just a result and a consequence of how we as a society have used certain technologies
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.200]   in a fallen world.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:47.440]   Yeah, yeah, you know, you mentioned, I know we're going to get into that we do get into
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:53.800]   this in the next episode, but you did mention that two didn't survive the thawing process.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:00.480]   So when when you adopt a family of six embryos, six people, they're frozen, not because of
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.800]   anything you did, but that's, that's how they survive, they're frozen.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:12.440]   And so in order to implant them, they need to be thawed, they have to be frozen.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.480]   So this thawing process is something that's a must.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:22.800]   And then during this thawing process, two don't survive, so two pass away.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   And that's, that's common, right?
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.480]   That's not some mishap by by the organization that that's just, that's just the state of
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.880]   the technology today that a certain portion of embryos do not survive.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.360]   Yeah, yes, absolutely.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.800]   That's just the reality, unfortunately, that that our technology has provided us thus far.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.320]   I mean, we hope that will get better.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:53.840]   But the reality is that, that in nearly all cases of IVF, embryos, children are frozen
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.920]   at some point, that's just for various reasons that we won't get into now.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.840]   But that is just generally how IVF procedures are done, it does result in the freezing of
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   these children.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.080]   And unfortunately, the reality is that when you freeze them, you will unless you plan
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.920]   to freeze them indefinitely, you will inevitably subject them to the thawing process and many
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.680]   children don't survive that process.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.160]   So that's, that's a concern.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   And we've sort of had a grief, you know, the loss of those two children, right?
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.160]   You know, we'll never get to see what they look like.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:36.360]   But we know, you know, you know, I know, people have different views on this, but but we hold
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.720]   that one day we will, we will be able to see them Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:51.560]   And you know, I think about after they're born, which is probably going to be in less
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.760]   than a week, we don't know, but at least humanly speaking, it's probably going to be less than
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.960]   a week from the time of this recording.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.560]   But they're gonna grow up, they're gonna have questions, right?
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.440]   And you mentioned they were Asian, but they're actually a different ethnic descent than than
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   you and Carrie.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Absolutely.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   Yes.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   Yes.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   They are Korean.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   Yes.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.600]   And so they're gonna grow up in a in a household that loves the Lord, they're gonna grow up
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.480]   in a loving family, and they're going to be taught Scripture, they're going to be encouraged
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.320]   to repent, they're going to grow up in this, this home.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.080]   At the same time, they're going to be asking, right?
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   Where did they come from?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.160]   They're going to be asking about these things.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:44.400]   And I can't help but think that they're going to look at their mom, Carrie.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:54.000]   And at some point, it's going to hit them that their mom saved them from slaughter.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.560]   It's just gonna at some point, it just it just hits you because and that's that's not
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   an exaggeration.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   Right?
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   I mean, that's just a logical consequence.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.400]   And you know, you mentioned, they can be frozen indefinitely, but you mean, humanly speaking,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.800]   because, you know, at some point, something happens, I mean, power can go out, or, you
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.840]   know, Christ comes back, or Yeah, you know, there, you know, and if someone's got to pay
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.200]   for preservation, so let's say you pay for preservation up until the point of, you know,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.120]   your death, I mean, at that point, you stop paying, exactly.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.440]   So they discard the embryo.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.920]   So and again, we talked, we're gonna talk about this, but we don't even like to use
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.280]   that word discard, discard embryos, because they're people.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:46.960]   But the point is that at some point, their life does cease to be and so it's not when
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:53.560]   I say at some point, these children will grow up, they'll look at their mom and realize
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.800]   that their mom saved them from slaughter.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:08.740]   Just the testimony that that gospel testimony of just how God has given us this understanding
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:14.680]   of the value of life and the implications that that arises from it, I think is going
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.400]   to be such a great testimony, you're you're you and your family are kind of like a trailblazer
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:28.240]   of sorts for this, but I say trailblazer because in the short time, relatively short time that
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   you've been open about this and and been talking about this, you have a blog, which I'm going
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.480]   to put in the information section, but you have a blog and carries me to Facebook group
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.560]   and you've you've been writing about this and I invite everyone to go to that blog to
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.640]   read some of your thoughts on this issue.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.360]   But in a short amount of time, I know of at least two couples, which I there I won't name,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.280]   but but they're probably public, they're pretty public about it.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.500]   But I know of at least two other couples who are undergoing this process.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.960]   One other couple, she's already had gone through the implantation process.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.400]   Yeah, you know, we're, we're praying for for that couple.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.760]   So it's already happening.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.160]   God is God is God is using this.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.640]   So you know, when you when you kind of reflect on that, do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:32.120]   Like, just, yeah, yes, I think it's been a great encouragement to know that there are
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:38.080]   other couples being convicted in similar ways, we know that the body is made up of different
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.920]   members, and, you know, everyone is gifted in different ways by the Spirit, and convicted
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.040]   in different ways, too.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:54.200]   And so when a couple comes, and is convicted similarly, and walks with us through the process,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.960]   and we see them walking as well through the same thing.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:05.400]   It's an incredible encouragement that it's it's it's a grace of that God gives through
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.000]   the church.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.720]   It was certainly difficult in the beginning, because we didn't really know whether we were
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:22.360]   like many hearing about embryo adoption and having no idea what it was, what it is about,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.400]   and thinking all these weird thoughts about, you know, that sounds really like fiction.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.840]   That sounds like, just very odd.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.040]   That was us in the beginning.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   And apart from the conviction of God's word, and what he was saying, there were a lot of
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:47.040]   doubts in our minds whether this was even a real act of obedience, whether this was
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:54.280]   a proper application of scriptural truth, because at the time, we didn't really know
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   people going through it.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   I mean, we just read it in a book, you know, and we didn't know if this family in the book
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   was, you know, really had was like minded in many ways.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:10.000]   So we just kind of got exposed to it through it, you know, through Providence, you know,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   but we didn't know.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.200]   And then fortunately, God did bring other people alongside of us, you know, Cary connected
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.400]   with other people who had gone through it.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:24.160]   And then now that our church, there's more and more people, it's become just a tremendous
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   encouragement to us that God would just bring us alongside other people to rescue souls
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:40.040]   for his glory, physically, but but also, you know, I trust in a spiritual sense as he brings
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.120]   people who are not genetically related, these children who are not genetically related,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:52.760]   but he allows families to adopt them into families that love him, and that want to raise
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.800]   children in the discipline instruction of our God, that God will save these children's
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.360]   souls.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.640]   And so it's, it's just a profound thought to think that God would advance his kingdom
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.640]   in this way.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:13.680]   Yeah, it's, it wasn't, I had no idea this was going to happen, you know, a couple years
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.040]   ago, but to think now that God is using our church in this way, and he's advancing his
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:27.360]   kingdom in this way, by families adopting frozen children into their families.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.040]   Yeah, that's, that's an amazing thought.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.360]   And I'm thankful that so many families are just have been supportive throughout our whole
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:40.040]   journey, you know, from the pastors, the elders, the leadership, and then just members of the
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.760]   church just incredibly supportive, just affirming that this is biblical, that this is a proper
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.480]   application of biblical truth.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.320]   And then, you know, like you mentioned, several other families just, you know, taking that
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.480]   step to do it as well.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:07.560]   And, you know, I, it's one of those things where, you know, sometimes when I hear stories
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:14.760]   like this, I hate to make qualifications, but I want to go in and do so just to be a
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.640]   little cautious here, but in no way, and I've spoken to Jeremiah many times about this issue
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   and related issues, in no way does he believe or do I believe that if you've had an abortion
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:34.520]   in the past, that you've created an irredeemable, you've committed an irredeemable sin, a sin
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.680]   that you can't repent of, neither one of us believes that.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:46.120]   In no way do Jeremiah and I believe that if you've utilized IVF before and you created
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:52.360]   an excess number of, in the process, there was a creation of an excess number of embryos
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:57.840]   and those embryos are now gone, in no way are we saying that that's also some sin that
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.200]   you cannot repent of, but that's not what we're saying.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:09.560]   We're also not saying that if you don't adopt traditionally, or if you don't adopt embryonically,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.080]   if you don't adopt that, that you don't take God seriously, we're not, we're not saying
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   that either.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.360]   And, again, I don't want what we say to die the death of a thousand qualifications as
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.920]   Vodie Bauckham would say that sometimes if you qualify things so much, you don't really
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:32.080]   say anything, so I kind of want to stop there, but the reason I say that is because sometimes
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:40.280]   when people have strong convictions, even if they go about it in a godly manner, because
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:49.880]   convictions can sometimes be painful, because when someone else's conviction is made clear,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:56.720]   it forces the person listening to the conviction to reconcile certain things in their own heart
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:03.440]   and I think just a matter of, you know, just our fleshly intuition is to discredit that
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:11.400]   person, you know, and to pay an excess amount of attention on their tone or their delivery
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.960]   or these other things.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   And there's a time and place for that kind of criticism, but I want, the reason I want
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.880]   to say that is because I want to make it clear for the listener that Jeremiah is not saying
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:32.560]   that, that is not, I didn't invite him here to shame other people and I've spoken, again,
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.040]   I've spoken to him many times, he doesn't want to do that, he's very careful that he
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:46.120]   comes off in a proper way and so I did want to take a little bit of time to state that,
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.640]   so with that said, you know, Jeremiah, there are other things that we can talk about with
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.260]   respect to some of the more medical nuances, but this podcast is already getting a little
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.920]   bit longer, this episode is already getting a little bit longer, so I do want the listener
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.640]   to know that, especially if you go to Brigham Coming Church, hey, you're available to talk
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   to, right?
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.320]   - Absolutely, yes, I love to talk to anyone and share our story about what God has done
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:17.880]   through us, but also, you know, with regards to future podcast episodes about related topics,
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:26.040]   you know, the science, as we will discuss, is very nuanced and I think it would be great
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:31.360]   to just continue to discuss these things and maintain a biblical worldview.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   - Yeah, yeah, don't worry, that's not Jeremiah butting himself in, I told him that we're
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:41.920]   gonna do future episodes together, so, so, he knew that, he knew that, but yeah, it is
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.080]   very, very nuanced, it's changing, Jeremiah tries to keep up-to-date with all the new
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:54.000]   information, and that's hard, you know, that's hard, but again, I invite you to follow him
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.760]   on Facebook, Kerry has a Facebook, The Littlest of Lives, The Littlest of Lives, you can talk
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.440]   to Kerry about it, you can message me about it, he also, if you go there, he also has
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:12.560]   a blog, you'll see it right away, I'll link to all of this, in the next episode, we're
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.520]   gonna get a little bit more into the particulars of IVF, because as, Jeremiah, you kind of
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:24.560]   stated this earlier, but a lot of the embryos that are available for adoption are because
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:33.000]   they are excess embryos from IVF, is that-- - Absolutely, yes, that's where almost all
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:41.200]   of the embryos that are available for adoption are created out of, they're all created out
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:48.040]   of IVF technology, but yes, mostly because couples do choose to create more than they
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:58.160]   plan to implant. - Yeah, and what's wild is that that one million is a fraction from the
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.040]   excess that are created, because the majority, correct me if I'm wrong, Jeremiah, but the
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:12.320]   majority are either just terminated, I'm using euphemisms here, but they're either terminated,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.280]   or they're, I'm using air quotes, donated to science, where they will be terminated,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.360]   or last step is they're donated to a center like this, hopefully that they'll be adopted.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.400]   - Absolutely, yeah. - Well, Jeremiah, I wanna thank you for coming
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:38.600]   on, I look forward to talking about this issue a little bit more in depth, and I hope for
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:48.360]   the people who are listening that God has moved you, and when I say that, I don't mean
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:56.160]   to imply that if you're not moved to share the gospel and apply in parenthood, then you're
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.440]   not a good Christian, I don't mean to, I don't, I'm not implying that at all, 1 Corinthians
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:08.640]   12, Romans 12 makes it clear that God has given the body differing gifts, and some people
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.920]   God will raise up to just be prayer warriors, their gift is, they just pray, they pray and
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.480]   pray and pray and pray, and I hope God will raise up more prayer warriors, but there are
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.000]   some that are listening to this that God will raise up, and say, you know what, I wanna
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.080]   share the gospel, I'd apply in parenthood too.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:32.760]   There are others who will just, you know what, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna engage in conversation
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.680]   with my coworkers about this issue, and hope that this is gonna be an entrance way for
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:46.560]   the gospel, or, you know, you affirm and you support the work that people who are passionate
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:53.040]   about this are doing, and you might be involved in something else at church, you are involved
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.800]   in, for example, like the avian ministry, or you're involved in, you know, cleanup ministry,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.320]   and we can just glory in our God together, that God would raise up some people to do
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.160]   this, and some people to do that, and that we are all striving together, differing gifts,
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:17.520]   but we're all striving together, standing as one man for the gospel, for the proclamation
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.400]   of the gospel, and so, I know that's Jeremiah, I know Jeremiah, that's your heart, that's
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:30.200]   my heart, that we want to see truth proclaimed, and we wanna see unity affirmed in the body
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.320]   of Christ, so, anything else you wanna share before we end this episode, Jeremiah?
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   - No, I think we're gonna cover them in the future episodes.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.360]   - All right, yeah, so I'm looking forward to that, well, Jeremiah, thank you very much,
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:52.320]   and I will see you guys later.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.960]   I hope this episode was helpful to many, this is a very difficult topic, and anyone searching
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.520]   for answers, and ultimately conviction on this issue is going to have to do some hard
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:10.360]   work, lots of digging, lots of investigating, searching the scriptures in prayer, as stated,
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.920]   I've included the Facebook group and Jeremiah's blog in the info section, I'm really hoping
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:24.960]   this will serve as a springboard of sorts, for anyone that's looking, I get it, this
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.560]   is going to be difficult.
