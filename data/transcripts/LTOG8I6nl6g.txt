[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.140]   - Welcome everyone to the 79th edition
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.480]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.520]   Our repeat guest today is Mike Piper.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.160]   Mike is a CPA and an expert on taxation,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.880]   estate planning, and social security.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.800]   Today we're gonna be talking about what to do
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.720]   if you become the executor of an estate
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.680]   with an emphasis on providing a financial guide
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.720]   for surviving biosecurity.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.440]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.520]   and I am the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.040]   This episode, as with all episodes,

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.120]   I have a couple of announcements
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.640]   before we get started today.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.640]   The YouTube videos from the 2024 Bogleheads Conference
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   in Minneapolis, Minnesota are now available online
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.600]   at boglecenter.net.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480]   All of the sessions were recorded
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   and they're all available for free
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.780]   at the Bogle Center website.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.780]   Second, the 2025 conference will be in San Antonio, Texas,
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.080]   the weekend of October 17th through the 19th.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.540]   It's in a wonderful location
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.840]   and it's gonna be a fabulous conference.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.720]   I'll provide more information on future podcasts
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.960]   when it becomes available.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.000]   Today, a special repeat guest is Mike Piper.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.760]   Mike is a CPA, the author of many books on finance,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.960]   taxation, and estate planning.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.640]   He is also the creator of the Oblivious Investor blog
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   and the creator of opensocialsecurity.com,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.480]   a free website for calculating
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   your maximum social security benefits.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.280]   Today, we're gonna be talking with Mike
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.160]   about estate planning and particularly what to do
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.440]   if you find yourself as the executor of an estate,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.760]   especially if you're a surviving spouse.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   Mike recently wrote a book titled
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.520]   "After the Death of a Spouse,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   "Next Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   With no further ado, let's welcome back Mike Piper.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   - Thank you, I'm happy to be here.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.920]   - Well, it's great to have you.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.320]   On this podcast, we're gonna talk about something
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.440]   a lot of people don't like to talk about.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.280]   In fact, they avoid talking about it
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.680]   and that is what happens in the event
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.720]   of the death of a spouse or a loved one,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.240]   could be your parent, someone else,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   where you are responsible for doing the estate.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.680]   You wrote a book, "After the Death of Your Spouse,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   "Next Financial Steps for Surviving Spouses."
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.960]   I have this book in my estate planning documents.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.240]   As soon as you open up my notebook
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   that I have put together for estate planning,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.640]   this is the first thing my wife would find
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.560]   or if it's unfortunately if my wife died before me,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.000]   this is the first thing I would go to
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.040]   because you've done a great job with this book
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.520]   and it really points out a lot of things we need to know
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.160]   but have a tendency to avoid learning about
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.040]   because it's not a really pleasant subject.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.600]   Great book, not very long, easy to read
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.320]   as all Mike Piper books are.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.960]   So we're gonna dive into this touchy topic
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.000]   but one that's necessary.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.400]   Mike, why did you decide to write the book?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.120]   Like you said, it's a topic
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600]   that many people don't like to think about.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.920]   People avoid it.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.800]   And so many people don't take the time to read about it.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.000]   And so writing a short book,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.400]   it was my way of hopefully getting people
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   to take the time to read a little bit about it.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   The other relevant point there is that people who avoid it
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   includes financial writers, right?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.640]   There aren't that many books about this topic
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.440]   whereas there are a million books
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   about just how to create a portfolio.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.400]   There's just a lot less writing about this topic.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.280]   Let's go ahead and dig into the book.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.000]   But again, we're gonna broaden it to not just spouses
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.440]   but anyone who becomes a personal representative
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.560]   for someone else who dies.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.960]   So if somebody's single,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.600]   obviously they're not gonna have a spouse.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.160]   Somebody else will step in.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.320]   So I'm gonna start out by going to the end of the book
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.520]   and reading what you wrote in the conclusion
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.280]   which is in addition to the burden of grief,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.520]   the death of your spouse or a loved one
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   imposes a surprisingly large
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   administrative burden upon you.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.280]   There's a lot to do.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.440]   Notifying a bunch of different entities
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.200]   that your spouse or a loved one has passed away,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.560]   handling the estate administration,
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.160]   filing tax forms, social security changes,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   taking a step back
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   and looking at your new financial situation,
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.640]   updating your own estate
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.920]   and seeing what changes to be made.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   I mean, there's just so much to do.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   And I thought that was the end of the book.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.400]   The conclusion that you came to
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.960]   was a good way to begin this conversation.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.680]   - There's an enormous amount of to-do items
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.480]   that suddenly land in your lap.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.520]   And unfortunately, this may be the time in a person's life
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   when they would have the hardest time
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   dealing with those to-do items, right?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.640]   Just because what they're going through emotionally
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.240]   just makes it that much harder.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   So it's helpful to have a guide
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.960]   to help walk you through it.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.160]   - And you divide the to-do list
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   between immediate steps and intermediate steps.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.280]   - Yeah, there are some things
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   that really do need to happen pretty darn quickly.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.840]   However, there's also another long list of things
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.520]   that do need to happen,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.320]   but which don't need to happen immediately.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.280]   So they are important, but not urgent.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.760]   And the reality is that many, many people
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.840]   report this experience,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.940]   not every single surviving spouse, but many,
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.120]   is that in the days and weeks and even months
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.320]   after your spouse's death,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.520]   there are various problems like memory challenges
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.560]   and just difficulty making decisions
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.760]   where this person is not someone
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   who would normally have a difficult time making decisions.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.480]   And so in many cases,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.640]   some of these very important decisions,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   it is actually a good idea
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.140]   not to try to tackle them immediately,
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.680]   to try to just put it off for a little bit.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.720]   We're not talking years,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.440]   but even several weeks or a few months.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.360]   Yes, take care of the immediate things,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.880]   but also just work on the grieving
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.240]   that you need to be doing and then tackle them.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.360]   - Before we get into the nuts and bolts
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.280]   of what those things are,
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.880]   we do need to go over some terminology,
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.520]   which can be confusing.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   So I'm just gonna throw the word out
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.560]   and you tell me what the definition is, okay?
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.400]   - Great.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.440]   - First of all, we all talk about settling your estate.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.280]   What does estate mean?
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   - An estate is a legal entity
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.020]   that comes into being when a person dies.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.840]   So it did not exist, and then when the person dies,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.120]   now it does suddenly exist.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.440]   And the estate's purpose is to be the entity
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   that essentially collects that person's assets
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.700]   and then ultimately distributes that person's assets
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.160]   to the appropriate beneficiaries and creditors.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.600]   That's the purpose of an estate.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.240]   - Do states treat estates differently?
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.980]   Is it done differently in California
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.520]   than in Texas or New York?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.320]   - Yes, that's the thing that's actually an important point
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.760]   and relevant to many of the things we'll talk about today.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.840]   It varies by state,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.680]   and in some cases it even varies by county.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   So it's really important to learn the specific rules
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.780]   where you live or where the estate
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.120]   is actually being administered,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.600]   which is not necessarily where you live.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.380]   But a lot of times we say, "Talk to an attorney."
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.920]   That's sort of this disclaimer
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.400]   that will be at the end of podcast episodes or what have you
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.360]   and people treat it as legalese and they kind of ignore it.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.600]   Here, when I say, "Talk to an attorney,"
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.000]   please understand that I really, really mean it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.160]   It's very valuable to speak with an attorney
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.040]   who has expertise in this topic
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.760]   in the appropriate jurisdiction.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.600]   - Good point.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.460]   Okay, the person who will administer this estate
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.760]   is called the executor.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.560]   The executor is a person named in the will
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   to administer the estate.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.480]   In some cases, if a person dies without a will,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   or if somehow they managed to create a will
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.820]   without naming an executor,
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.160]   the court would appoint somebody
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.060]   and then we call that person an administrator.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.800]   But collectively, these people,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.560]   whether it's an executor or an administrator,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.300]   collectively we generally refer to them
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.800]   as the personal representative of the estate,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.560]   meaning it's the personal representative
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.840]   whose job it is to administer the estate.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.440]   - When a spouse becomes the executor,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.160]   are they referred to as the personal representative
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.640]   or are they referred to as something else?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   - They would be an executor.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.040]   They would also generally be referred to
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.160]   as a personal representative of the estate.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.600]   It's a catch-all phrase, basically.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.560]   - Okay, very good.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   I'm gonna jump ahead a little bit here.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   You discuss you have to apply to become appointed
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.080]   as a personal representative.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.240]   Explain that.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.640]   - So the will, assuming there is one,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.400]   if it has named you as an executor,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   the court still needs to essentially agree
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.400]   that yes, you could be the executor.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.740]   You could be the personal representative of the estate.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.960]   Because something that happens
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.040]   is sometimes maybe multiple people are named as executor
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.320]   and one person chooses not to serve as the executor,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.200]   or maybe one person is named as the executor,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.520]   but then that person chooses not to serve
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.020]   and so the court needs to pick somebody else.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.280]   So ultimately, a court needs to be the party that says,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.680]   okay, now this person or this entity,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.880]   or in some cases, these multiple people,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.960]   are going to be the personal representatives of the estate.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.480]   And so until you get that official documentation
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.720]   that you are the personal representative,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.440]   you don't wanna actually go and do anything
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.640]   on behalf of the estate until you've been officially told
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.920]   that yes, you have the right to do that.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.980]   - So how long does it take?
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.120]   Because you have these immediate things
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.480]   that have to be done.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.120]   And how long does it take for the court
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.280]   to look at the will and say, you're the executor,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.800]   or appoint someone as the personal representative?
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.760]   - Generally, it's a very fast thing
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.840]   because in most cases,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   this is not something that's very controversial.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.360]   The surviving spouse or one of the decedent's children
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.160]   is named in the will as the executor
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.640]   and that person is willing to do it
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.040]   and nobody voices any objections.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.800]   The court isn't going to jump in and say,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.880]   oh, I don't think this person should be the executor,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.920]   it should be this other completely different person.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.480]   So generally, it's a pretty quick process.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.320]   - Let's back up.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.840]   How do you get in front of the judge?
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.880]   - So it's not necessarily an in-person thing.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.720]   In many, many cases,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.760]   you're not standing in front of a judge.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.120]   This is a paperwork process.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.960]   - Okay.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.320]   - The actual specific details though,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.800]   this is another thing where it's going to vary.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.680]   Are you filling out a form on a website?
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.880]   Are you submitting this particular documentation
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.360]   to this particular state or county entity?
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.840]   It's going to vary by state exactly
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.720]   what you need to give to whom
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.040]   in order to kick off that process.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   - And of course, whoever is named
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.800]   as the personal representative,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   spouse, nephew, niece, uncle, friend,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.480]   brother, sister, parent,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.640]   has a certain fiduciary duty to whom?
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.720]   - The personal representative of the estate
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.480]   has a fiduciary duty to all of the estate's beneficiaries,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   meaning the personal representative
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   has to put the interests of the beneficiaries
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.320]   ahead of their own interests,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   other than to the extent that they themselves
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   are a beneficiary of the estate.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.600]   - Now, some assets don't need to go through probate
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.120]   because of the way that they're titled
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.880]   or have a beneficiary attached to them.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.120]   So can they immediately move
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.920]   or does it take the executor to do it?
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.480]   First of all, explain what these assets are
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.760]   and then how they actually move.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.480]   - Sure, so a very common one would be an IRA.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   When you open an IRA somewhere,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.400]   the brokerage firm is generally going to ask you
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.360]   to fill out a beneficiary designation form.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.920]   And so you say that it's my spouse or my kids
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.560]   or my niece and nephews or whoever it is
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.640]   that gets these different percentages of the account.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.720]   So assets like that, so an IRA or a 401(k)
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.200]   that similarly is gonna have a beneficiary designation form
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.120]   or an annuity or a life insurance policy
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.960]   with a death benefit.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.800]   Again, it's gonna have a named beneficiary.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.640]   So any of these things that have named beneficiaries,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.840]   as well as if, for instance, you have a bank account
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.040]   that's titled with the payable on death
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.600]   beneficiary designated.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.320]   So any of those things, they don't go through probate.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.520]   They basically just go directly to the named beneficiary
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.160]   or beneficiaries without needing to go through probate.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.520]   In theory, the executor or personal representative
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   is not responsible for that process
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.960]   because their job is to handle the probate estate.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   But as a practical matter, in many cases,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.880]   that person may also be the beneficiary.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.000]   And so they're the one contacting the brokerage firm
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.640]   that has the IRA to notify them of the death.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.720]   So in many cases, the executor is the one
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.600]   who is contacting all the relevant parties
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.840]   to kick off the transfer process.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.680]   - One of the things you talked about was payable on death,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.120]   which is a beneficiary on a bank account.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   And there's also transfer on death,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.160]   which would be something you could put
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   on a brokerage account if it's not in a trust,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.800]   or you could put it on real estate in many states,
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.280]   not all states, but many states.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.440]   You could have a transfer on death deed
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.240]   and go directly to that person.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.120]   And real quick here, what if that person is a minor?
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   - Yes, then we have a situation.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.600]   In many cases, you don't want to do that to begin with,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.760]   generally speaking.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.360]   It would be preferable to designate a trust
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.880]   as the beneficiary and then designate the minor
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.560]   as the beneficiary of the trust.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.520]   But in general, if assets are left to a minor,
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.200]   then there's going to be a guardian
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.160]   whose job it is to administer those assets
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.920]   for the benefit of the minor.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.480]   - But I do want to get into trusts a little bit more,
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.800]   because trusts are kind of special entities.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.040]   - And many people have questions
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.840]   about whether they should have a trust,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.360]   should not have a trust.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.960]   - Talk about the three parties to a trust
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.360]   and then using them for avoiding probate.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.960]   - Yeah, so a trust is a legal entity
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.160]   that can own assets, is basically what a trust is.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.760]   And anybody who wants to can create a trust.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   And there are three parties to a trust.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.040]   There's the grantor, who is the person who creates it
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.440]   and contributes assets to fund the trust.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.840]   There is the trustee, who is the person whose job it is
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   to manage the assets of the trust.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.680]   And they have to do that for the benefit of the beneficiary.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.400]   And that's the third party to the trust,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.640]   is the beneficiary.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.000]   And that is the person for whose benefit
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.240]   the assets in the trust are being managed.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.080]   There's a couple interesting points about this,
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.840]   is that for those three parties,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.040]   the grantor, the trustee, and the beneficiary,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.720]   they don't have to be different parties.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   So a very frequent thing for a person who creates a trust
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.840]   is they set it up, they are the grantor.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.160]   They make themselves the initial trustee,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.720]   so they still have the power over all of the assets
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.520]   to decide what investment decisions
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.480]   and how the money gets spent and so on.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.160]   And they are the beneficiary.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.000]   So the assets are in the trust
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.840]   for the benefit of themselves.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.960]   So when that's the case, it's not all that different
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.920]   than just having owned the assets in the first place.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.440]   But then the point is, you would then also have
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.200]   a successor trustee in place.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.360]   And so that would be the person who will take over
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.280]   managing the assets when you no longer can,
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.240]   either because you have died or you've become incapacitated.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.560]   And then you would have successor beneficiaries.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.200]   And those are the people for whose benefit
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.040]   the assets would be managed after your death.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   And so often that would be your kids or your grandkids,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.080]   or it could be a nonprofit organization or what have you.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.400]   And so the general idea of a trust
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   is to exert some sort of control over the assets
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.920]   after your death or incapacitation in some way
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.360]   and for some reason.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.640]   And the list of reasons is long and varied,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.360]   but that's the general idea is that you're putting this,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.200]   creating this entity that can own assets,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.560]   and then we can assign these different powers
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.960]   and rights to different people.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.600]   - By the way, there are different trusts that avoid probate
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.040]   and there are trusts that do not avoid probate.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.880]   It's very interesting.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.120]   I do wanna get into this right now
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.600]   because if you open a trust while you're alive
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.440]   and you fund it and then you die,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   that does not go through probate, correct?
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   - Correct.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.560]   If you have assets in a trust
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.600]   and there's a named beneficiary of the trust,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.520]   then the assets will just go to that beneficiary
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.560]   completely outside of probate.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.880]   - But the assets have to be in the trust.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.360]   I mean, you could create a trust.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   I could create the Rick Ferry Trust
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   and I have a brokerage account with my name on it,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.600]   individual brokerage account,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.480]   that in my will, I say, okay, when I die,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.840]   I want the assets of this brokerage account
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.120]   to go into my personal trust.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   But the only way those assets are gonna get into the trust
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.400]   is if it goes through probate, correct?
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.240]   - Yes.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.520]   You've named the trust as the beneficiary
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.080]   of the account in your will.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.480]   So probate is the process
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.880]   through which the terms of the will
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.000]   actually are implemented.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.840]   So if the will says the assets
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.160]   are going from this account into the trust,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.800]   then yes, it has to go through probate
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   in order for that to occur.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.120]   - And it kind of defeats the purpose.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.480]   I always thought that why would you wanna do that?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.000]   Why not fund the trust now?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.160]   You put your house in the trust, your real estate,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.200]   your brokerage account,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.960]   put that in the trust now while you're alive,
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.880]   rather than waiting till you die.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.400]   If the purpose is to avoid probate.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   - If the purpose of the trust is to avoid probate,
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.000]   then absolutely, we want to fund the trust
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.200]   with the assets prior to death.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.760]   No question about it.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   - I have to say, after so many clients, Mike,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.320]   that I work with,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.280]   their attorneys didn't set it up that way.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   They wrote the will so that the will creates the trust,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.880]   and then the will funds the trust.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.800]   And this has a term.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.000]   What's the term of this?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.600]   - So there's a testamentary trust,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.720]   which is where the will creates the trust,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.560]   just like you said.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.280]   So we have to probate the will
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   in order for the trust to be created in the first place.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.840]   And then the will also says,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.480]   and now these assets go to the trust.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.760]   - And there are so many people I talk with
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.080]   who have this as part of their estate plan.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.440]   And I say, why are you doing it that way?
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.400]   Why did your attorney set it up that way?
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.880]   The whole idea is to avoid probate with these assets.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.720]   And I finally asked my own estate planning attorney,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.560]   and he goes, oh, well,
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.200]   that's the Trust Attorney Job Security Act.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.240]   That leads to more billable hours.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.440]   - I guess I'd back up a step and say
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.160]   that there are various very good reasons to have a trust,
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.720]   other than just avoiding probate.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.400]   There could be reasons where, you know,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.320]   we simply don't have a need for the trust until that point.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.480]   Still, it might, even in some of those cases,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.320]   it might have made sense
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.440]   to go ahead and create the trust now,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   especially if it's a revocable trust.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.560]   So it's not like we're, you know,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.880]   losing any flexibility here.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.440]   But there are a whole lot of different reasons
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.280]   why a person might want to have a trust.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.600]   And given how varied the number of reasons are,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.360]   the appropriate setups are similarly varied.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.320]   - Funny, I asked the clients,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.400]   well, how come it's set up this way?
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.800]   How come you're not funding the trust now?
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.000]   And they said, well, I don't know.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.840]   I don't know why.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.640]   It's my way, my attorney said to do it.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.040]   Have the will set up the trust
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.480]   and then fund the trust later when we die.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.880]   And I said, well, then it goes through probate.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.720]   They go, yeah, you know,
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.280]   we don't want the assets to go through probate.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.880]   I said, well, you're not doing it right.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.520]   - Another thing I'll back up and say though,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.160]   is that it's very, very frequently,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.120]   the attorney create the trust now.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.960]   It's not a testamentary trust,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.360]   but the client then forgets to fund it.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.400]   They just never get around
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.800]   to moving the assets into the trust.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.040]   That happens all the time.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.200]   And so that's just a mistake.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.560]   - No, I see that all the time.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.040]   You're absolutely right.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.200]   We're gonna go back to the beginning again.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.240]   I know we get off on a tangent.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.640]   That's just the way these things are gonna go today
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.320]   with this podcast.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.640]   So the executor.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   You think you're the executor of an estate,
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.440]   but maybe you don't know.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.480]   If you're a spouse, you probably are,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.720]   but you have to find out
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.280]   who the executor of the estate is.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   And for that, you would need to find the estate documents.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.160]   Talk about where to keep estate documents
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.600]   and who to give access to.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.320]   I'm sure there's a lot of estate documents
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.400]   that are never found.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.160]   - Yes, so your will and other estate documents,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.240]   you want the attorney who helped you prepare them
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.640]   to have a copy.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.840]   And you want to keep a copy for yourself,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.600]   ideally in somewhere that is reasonably easy
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.280]   for some appropriate party to find if they need to.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.000]   But also, frankly, I would say,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   go ahead and give a copy in advance
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.600]   to whoever you're naming as the executor.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.760]   And certainly if you're giving anybody
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.600]   power of attorney or something like that,
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.200]   give them that document.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.320]   Don't rely on them finding it somewhere on your hard drive.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   - What I did is I opened up a Dropbox folder
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.360]   and I put all my documents in a Dropbox folder
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.840]   and then I gave the link to my children.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.560]   So the documents are available.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.600]   But my question is, they're not the signed documents?
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   They're just a PDF, is that okay?
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.600]   - That's going to vary what one entity wants to see
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.760]   as opposed to another one.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.200]   In many cases, they will want the actual hard copy document,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.880]   but it's going to vary from one entity to another,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.120]   what documentation they feel like they need.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.720]   - Okay, well, they know how to get that too.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.600]   Okay, so here you are.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.680]   You are now the executor of an estate
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.880]   or personal representative,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.040]   and you got to get organized.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.880]   So what do you do?
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.760]   - I think, personally, step number one
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.440]   is just create a filing system,
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.360]   both on your computer for all the various PDFs
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.400]   that you're going to have, and there's going to be a million,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.120]   and then also a physical filing system
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.520]   for the paperwork that you're going to have,
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.920]   and there's going to be some of that as well.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.080]   And so you've got retirement accounts, bank accounts,
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.520]   insurance policies, all the different categories of things.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.040]   Create that filing system.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.920]   In addition, take notes.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.400]   This is the time to start taking notes,
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.200]   and I would encourage you to take notes on everything,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   literally everything.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.640]   Every time you talk to anyone about anything
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.200]   or make any significant decision, take notes about it.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   Take dated notes.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.120]   There's two reasons for that.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.320]   Number one is, of course, there's the liability.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.520]   You always want to be able to say,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.640]   this is what I did and why.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.400]   But the other reason is just more basic,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   and it is that through this process,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.560]   you are going to be interacting with bureaucracy
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.440]   and a whole bunch of different bureaucracies, frankly.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.160]   You've got the federal government, state government,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.280]   potentially county government.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.080]   You've got this bank and that bank
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.720]   and this brokerage firm and that insurance company,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.640]   and they all want this different documentation.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   They all need you to jump through the different hoops,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.160]   and it's really, really easy.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.280]   Even if you weren't going through a period of grief
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.240]   and the difficult challenges that that imposes on you,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.920]   it's still very easy, if you aren't taking notes,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.880]   to lose track, to just drop the ball
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.320]   on one of those processes.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   Forget that, oh, this company needed that,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.480]   or which of these two companies was it
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.240]   that was still asking me for this particular documentation
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.760]   or whatever it is?
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   So just take notes so that you know exactly where you stand
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.000]   with the appropriate process
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.640]   for your state's Department of Revenue
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.520]   and for the Bank of America account
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.600]   that you're trying to have transferred,
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.240]   and all the different things.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.760]   You want to know exactly where you stand
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.360]   for each of the processes
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.320]   and exactly what the next step is.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.520]   - Okay, we've started to take notes.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.400]   We've created the filing system.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.480]   We have a plan.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.360]   - What documents should we be getting together?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.080]   - Right, so as we're first going through everything,
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.360]   obviously, we need to find the will
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   is the first number one thing
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.120]   that we really, really want to find.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.360]   Track that down.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.680]   While you're going through that process,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.760]   you're probably going to encounter
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.240]   a whole bunch of other stuff, too.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.920]   You're gonna start to see brokerage statements,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.080]   insurance policies, insurance statements,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.960]   whatever financial statements you find, keep them.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.360]   Whatever you're looking for one document,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.320]   whatever other documents you find,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.680]   go ahead and file them now.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.880]   Don't just ignore them,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.720]   because there's gonna be some point later
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.840]   we are going to be looking for that document.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.600]   And if you just go ahead and file it now,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.760]   you've made your life easier in the future.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.560]   - Well, I would imagine one of the first documents
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.960]   you want to get is a death certificate, correct?
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.840]   - Yes, so the funeral home, in many cases,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.680]   or if the person, the decedent, is being cremated,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.160]   then the entity that is in charge of their remains
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.240]   is generally going to prepare the necessary documentation
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.000]   so that the death certificates will be created.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.800]   And they will often ask you
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.480]   how many copies of those you want.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.160]   Alternatively, you can go ahead and get them
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.080]   from your state or county's applicable government entity.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.120]   Go ahead and look, by the way, what the fees are,
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.840]   'cause they're often different from one entity to another.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.120]   You've got, you know, and you're getting the same document.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   So go ahead and look at that.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.080]   Go ahead and look at what the wait time is.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   Sometimes one entity can get it to you
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.040]   faster than the other one.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.320]   And they're going to ask you how many copies you want.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   - And how many do we want?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.680]   - Right, that's an interesting question
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   because in the book, I said, "Ask for a lot, 20 to 30."
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.280]   And then the feedback I've gotten is hilarious.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.000]   You've got several people who said,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.680]   "Oh my goodness, that's ridiculous.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.880]   "I only needed three or something."
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.120]   And then a whole bunch of people who said,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.360]   "Yes, absolutely, make sure to ask for a ton."
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.520]   And it's just because it's going to vary.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.360]   Because again, some entities will want the actual,
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.920]   you know, certified death certificate.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.160]   Other entities are perfectly fine
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.840]   with you emailing them a PDF.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.120]   It's just going to vary in a way
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.880]   that's not necessarily super predictable.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.520]   Also, there's generally going to be a fee per copy.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.360]   However, it's in most cases, not going to be exorbitant.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.280]   Here in Missouri, it's $11 per copy.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.800]   Getting another handful, you know,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.840]   several more than you might expect to need
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.320]   costs a little bit, but it's not too big of a deal.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.400]   And if it saves you weeks of waiting down the line
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.840]   when some entity needs it and you don't have any more,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.920]   it's usually going to be worth it
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   to just ask for somewhat more than you expect to need.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.680]   - So I'm just going to go through a laundry list here
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.520]   of documents to acquire or look for.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.000]   We need the death certificate.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.160]   We need the will and the other estate planning documents.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.680]   We need whatever information you can find about pensions,
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.720]   social securities, insurance, birth certificates,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.360]   income tax, state income tax, deeds on your home,
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.960]   other property, vehicles.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.280]   I mean, you're just in this information gathering mode.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.120]   - Exactly.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.080]   So if you are the personal representative of the estate,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   one of your primary jobs is to take an inventory
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.240]   of the estate's assets.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.720]   And so a part of that process is just collecting,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.840]   exactly like you said,
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.680]   it's an information gathering process.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.640]   We need to find all of the accounts that there are.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.560]   And maybe, hopefully, you know offhand
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   what all of those accounts are.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.400]   But in many cases,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.000]   especially when the personal representative
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.560]   is not a spouse, they're a child,
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.120]   you don't necessarily know where mom and dad
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.720]   had all of their different financial accounts.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.560]   - Right.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.240]   - It's a bit of a treasure hunt.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.120]   Whatever we can look through, basically.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.360]   If we get access to their email, we're going through that.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.520]   We're looking through their hard drive,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.140]   we're looking through their mail, whatever it is,
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.920]   to try to find whatever evidence there is of accounts.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.360]   - You know, I don't know how many times
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.080]   I have conversations with people
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.200]   about simplifying their investment.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.600]   You know, you've got four different IRA accounts
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.720]   or three different old 401(k)s.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.960]   And the 401(k) you're currently in is perfectly fine.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.120]   You have the low-cost target date index funds.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   I mean, they're really great investment options.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.080]   And you've got these IRAs out there, rollover IRAs,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   and old 401(k)s, 403(b)s.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.380]   And I'm saying, just get all this stuff in one spot.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.000]   Reduce the number of custodians you have.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.100]   Reduce the number of redundant accounts that you have.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.320]   And even the securities, you know,
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.880]   reduce redundancy of securities within those accounts.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.600]   Simplifying your investment portfolio,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.420]   not just for your sake,
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.840]   but for whoever's gonna take over this,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.640]   makes it so much easier.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.760]   - Absolutely agree.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.960]   Simplification is a big favor to your surviving spouse,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.440]   your kids, whoever it is,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.320]   who's going to ultimately be handling this.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.720]   - Okay, let's go ahead and go to the next thing.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.780]   So we're getting all this information.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.860]   Now we have to start talking with people.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.000]   The social security checks may still be coming in,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.280]   or pension, or something's going on.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.760]   You want to try to get the insurance money.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.560]   So you've got to start notifying people.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.680]   - First step, make a list of the different entities
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.940]   that you think you'll need to notify.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.120]   And just like you said, social security administration,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.840]   anybody else paying benefits,
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.960]   you know, if the decedent had a pension, for instance,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.280]   or a lifetime annuity,
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.680]   any place that the decedent had a financial account,
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.360]   there's a long list.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.000]   And so that's step number one,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.800]   is just in your records,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.960]   decide these are the people who I will need to notify.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.000]   And then really in most cases,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.240]   it's just the phone call is where we start.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.180]   - Oh, really, they won't need a death certificate
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.260]   to, let's say, take the name off something?
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.100]   When do you need it?
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.920]   When don't you need it?
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.140]   - Sorry, they generally will need a death certificate.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.200]   The way we start the process is with a phone call.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.220]   - Oh. - Talk to a human being
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.420]   and ask them what it is that they need to see,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.540]   what they need you to do,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.620]   and then just go from there,
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.560]   is generally how I would suggest doing it.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.180]   But yes, in most cases,
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.780]   they are going to need to see a death certificate.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.980]   In some cases, they're happy with an emailed PDF.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.220]   In other cases, they will want a physical copy.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.020]   And so that's the reason to begin with
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.400]   why we ask for multiple copies
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.420]   of the certified death certificate.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.020]   - Let me ask a technical question here.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.740]   Let's say that you're settling the estate
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.580]   for your uncle or your aunt.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.880]   And they have a house,
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.020]   and they need to pay taxes, they need to pay bills,
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.020]   need to pay utilities,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.900]   'cause the house will eventually be sold,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.620]   but it's gonna take a while for the house to sell.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.700]   So you need to contact the utility companies and say,
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.860]   this person has passed away.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.940]   If you try to automatically bill their account or whatever,
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.980]   it's not gonna work anymore
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.120]   because they're not alive anymore.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.220]   How does it get paid?
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.180]   Who do they bill?
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.980]   - Yeah, what a lot of people do
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.060]   is give them an alternative credit card
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.980]   or an alternative bank account.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.640]   A challenge here, though,
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.380]   is that if we have an estate, for instance,
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.840]   it's going to be split up among several different people.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.300]   And now if you give them your personal credit card
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.600]   or something like that,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.820]   then we have an equity issue, right?
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.020]   Where one person's paying the costs
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.520]   when really it should be borne appropriately
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.800]   across the estate.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.820]   Generally, once you've been named
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.920]   as the personal representative of the estate,
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.060]   you will want to get a bank account for the estate.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.180]   Of course, that process can take some time,
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.280]   but generally that's what you wanna do.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.120]   - And a checking? - Exactly.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.660]   A checking account for the estate.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.140]   - Debit card. - Exactly.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.700]   So that way we can have the assets moved into that account,
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.200]   and then we can actually use that account
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.900]   to pay these bills.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.200]   - That does take a little bit of time,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.140]   and in the meantime, you may be paying it yourself,
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.660]   and then I guess you have to get reimbursed
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.500]   from that account eventually.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.340]   - Yeah, there may be a gap period in the middle
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.280]   where we are getting things set up,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.360]   where we need to come up with some other solution.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.300]   But yes, we want to get a checking account for the estate
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.580]   so that we can pay the estate's bills out of that account.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.100]   - So with this bank account
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.980]   that we're supposed to be opening,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.100]   whose social security number did we put it on?
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.260]   I mean, the person died, so what do we do?
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.460]   - Right, the estate, we want to get a tax ID,
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.100]   also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.600]   And the IRS website just has a form
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.140]   that you can fill out to do that.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.060]   It's easy, it's free, only takes a few minutes.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.660]   So that's a step that we'll want to do.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.680]   If you are the personal representative of the estate,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.740]   you will want to get an employer identification number
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.740]   for the estate.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.060]   It's essentially, you could think of it
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.260]   as a social security number for the estate.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.100]   - And then this is the number.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.300]   And then when I go to the bank to get the bank account,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.420]   is the title of it, you know, the estate of Jane Smith?
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.740]   Or is that how you title the account?
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.220]   - Something to that effect.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.460]   Different banks or different brokerage firms or whatever
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.060]   are going to have different rules
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.460]   for exactly how they title it.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.220]   But yes, it's going to be something to that effect.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.780]   And then they will use the estate's tax ID
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.020]   in place of a social security number.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.780]   - This seems to be like one of the most important things
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.860]   to do, right, is to get this bank account set up
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.380]   so that you could pay bills, have money that is owed
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.420]   to the person who died come into this account
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.500]   because it can't go into their personal account anymore.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.940]   It has to go somewhere else.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.180]   - Right, any income that otherwise would have been
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.500]   the decedent's income is now the estate's income.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.620]   So it should be being paid into a bank account
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.900]   for the estate.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.260]   And similarly, any of the estate's expenses,
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.100]   we really want them to be paid out of the estate's assets
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.180]   rather than somebody else's assets.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.580]   It's much clearer record keeping,
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.460]   prevents any number of different potential problems
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.300]   down the line.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.820]   - How does it work with social security?
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.820]   So spouse dies and you need to stop social security
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.660]   for that spouse.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.060]   Now, you might be taking that spouse's benefit
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.100]   because it's higher than your benefit.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.380]   How does it work through the social security office
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.420]   to set that up?
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.580]   - Yeah, so you need to call them.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.460]   We need to let them know that this person has died.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.940]   And they are going to stop payment of benefits,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.620]   obviously, if that person was receiving benefits.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.060]   And the month in which the person died,
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.580]   that payment, if it has already been made,
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.100]   will have to be retracted, basically.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.860]   So if a person died in February,
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.620]   the benefit for February will ultimately need
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.060]   to go back to the SSA.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.620]   And that means because there's a one-month lag,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   so the benefit for February is the benefit
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.300]   that's paid in March.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.740]   That benefit that is paid in March
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.700]   has to go back to the SSA.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.060]   - And it doesn't matter if you died on February 1st
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.020]   or February 28th.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.860]   - Correct.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.780]   So that's step number one.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.620]   We need to let them know
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.780]   so they can stop payment of benefits.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.860]   Then there's also the question of,
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.300]   okay, well, now do we need to file
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.860]   for any other types of benefits?
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.660]   If the decedent had a minor child
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.700]   or an adult disabled child,
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.940]   then that person is likely going to be able
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.660]   to receive a benefit on the deceased person's work record.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.140]   And in most cases, we wanna go ahead
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.500]   and file for that benefit immediately.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:08.340]   If the surviving spouse has a child in their care
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.980]   who is receiving child benefits
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.680]   on the decedent's work record,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.980]   then that surviving spouse is likely going to want to file
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.040]   for what we call mother/father benefits.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.580]   If there are no children,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.460]   no minor children or adult disabled children,
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.760]   then the only type of benefit
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.120]   that we're now really concerned with
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.300]   is a surviving spouse benefit.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.100]   And that, you have to be at least age 60
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.140]   or age 50 if you're disabled.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.340]   And the most important thing to know
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.340]   about surviving spouse benefits
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.900]   is that if you're eligible for that
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.300]   and you are eligible or will be eligible
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.100]   for your own retirement benefit,
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.180]   you can file for one or the other
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.080]   and then let the one that you did not file for
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.660]   continue to grow.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.820]   Several years ago, there was a similar strategy available
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.780]   for spousal benefits and that went away.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.260]   Congress changed the rules,
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.140]   but they did not change the rules for surviving spouses.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.980]   - Let me understand.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   So I worked for 40 quarters.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.740]   I'm going to get my own benefit,
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.140]   but I haven't filed yet.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.940]   My spouse dies.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.700]   I can file for the surviving spouse benefit
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.220]   and get that now,
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.940]   but not file for my own.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.660]   I can wait for my own to grow till age 70
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.300]   and then I can get more.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.420]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.860]   - That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.260]   If in that example, we assume you're at least age 60
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.940]   so that you're eligible for that survivor benefit.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.540]   - And it is age 60, it's not 62 for a surviving spouse.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.380]   - Correct.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.180]   It's 62 for a person's own retirement benefit,
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.900]   as well as a spousal benefit
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.740]   when both people are still alive,
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.780]   but for a surviving spouse benefit, it's age 60.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.700]   - So from here, I want to get into taxes.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.660]   Many different filings that need to take place.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.540]   First of all, you've got a person who died
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.940]   and you need to file a tax return
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.220]   up until the date of death, correct?
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.060]   - Yes.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.820]   It's a little bit different if they were married.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.660]   - Okay.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.060]   - If you have a married couple,
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.780]   then they're still going to file,
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.780]   or at least they can file a joint return for that full year.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.460]   So if you have husband and wife,
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.380]   let's say the husband dies on June 27th,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.020]   then it's going to be a return
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.980]   that includes all of the wife's income for the year
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.060]   and the husband's income up until the date of death.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.060]   So that's what's going to go
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.340]   on their joint return for that year.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.180]   And then separately,
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.540]   the personal representative of the estate
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.780]   is going to have to file an income tax return.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.300]   Now this is Form 1041, as opposed to Form 1040.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.460]   They're going to file an income tax return
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.140]   for all of the estate's income for the year.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.020]   So that would basically be beginning
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.980]   immediately after the death.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.540]   - But just money that goes to that person
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.980]   who passed.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.940]   - Right, it's the estate's income.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.700]   So that could be income that would have been
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.260]   the decedent's income that is now paid to the estate.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.300]   It's also, you know, interest and dividends
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.940]   on taxable assets or so on.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.740]   - Personal brokerage account of some sort.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.580]   - Right, exactly.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.580]   There's the tax return for the individual or the couple,
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.780]   and then there's the income tax return for the estate.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:25.060]   And then finally, the third thing is the estate tax return.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.020]   And you don't necessarily have to file this
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.620]   because most estates are well below
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.020]   the federal estate tax threshold.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.540]   However, even if the estate is well below that threshold,
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.420]   it is often a good idea anyway to file it
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   because what that lets you do is it lets the surviving spouse
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.340]   use any portion of the estate tax exemption
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.300]   that was not used.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.860]   It lets the surviving spouse use it later, essentially.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.940]   So that is a pretty compelling reason to file Form 706,
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.700]   which is the estate tax return,
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.540]   even if the decedent's estate was well below
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.660]   the applicable threshold for that year.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.660]   - The deceased's tax return has to be filed what date?
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.540]   - That's, it's just the regular income tax filing.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.380]   - April 15th?
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.220]   - Right, yeah, plus extensions if applicable.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.620]   - What about the estate tax return?
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.740]   They died June 27th.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.020]   That also needs to be filed by April 15th?
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.300]   - That depends because you can have a taxable year
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.380]   for the estate that is different than the calendar year
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.460]   in some cases.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.820]   You can keep it simple, make it the calendar year,
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.900]   in which case then it is April 15.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.140]   But if you elect for a different taxable year,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.780]   then the due date would be shifted accordingly.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.980]   - And the estate tax filing,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.940]   which is different than these other two,
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.540]   when should you do that?
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.500]   So let's give an example.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.420]   So your estate is worth $18 million, all total.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   And so right now the threshold for each individual
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.740]   is 14 million, roughly.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   So you die, you're going to use your portion.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.180]   Whatever you don't use goes over to your spouse.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.420]   But in order for that to happen,
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.860]   you have to file this other tax form.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.620]   - Right, form 706.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.260]   And the deadline for that one
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.340]   is nine months from the date of death.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.700]   There's also a six-month extension if you request that.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.440]   - Wow.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.780]   For somebody who doesn't do the tax returns at home,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.140]   you have one spouse who's sort of the financial person
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.580]   and the other ones who are the disinterested person,
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.180]   we tend to say.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.420]   This is huge burden of an incredible amount of stuff.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.820]   They gotta have help.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.660]   - Yes.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.580]   - Gotta have help here.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.140]   - Especially in vocal heads, we tend towards DIYers, right?
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.100]   People who like to do it yourself,
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.620]   shun professional assistants to an extent.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.860]   But really, especially if the surviving spouse,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.260]   like you said, was the one who was not the financial manager
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.140]   of the household, really it's a good idea
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.540]   to get help with this.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.220]   Enlisting a CPA or enrolled agent or tax attorney
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.940]   to handle the actual preparation
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.260]   and filing of the tax returns is a great idea.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.820]   Having an estate attorney to help with probate
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.860]   is generally a great idea as well.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.860]   And then potentially, depending on circumstances,
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.140]   engaging a financial planner
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.260]   to date that person's financial plan as needed
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.500]   based on the new circumstances
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.340]   can be a good idea as well in some cases.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.140]   - I wanna get into an area of succession planning,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.940]   getting back to my point
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.860]   that there's often a financial person in the family
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.460]   and then there's a disinterested person,
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.780]   someone who doesn't wanna do it.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.500]   My wife, for example, she won't listen to this podcast.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.260]   Somebody's going to have to help her manage
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.180]   all of this money and believe me,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.780]   I've kept my stuff very, very simple.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:12.060]   Try to consolidate accounts, consolidate custodians,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.420]   simple investments, try to keep it simple.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.900]   Which has worked wonders, by the way,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.940]   as far as a rate of return.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.420]   I mean, I've done really well.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.860]   I've gotten my fair share.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.740]   But she'll need somebody to help her with the portfolio.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.060]   Now, I've already identified somebody to help her.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.780]   She knows who to go to.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.380]   But a lot of people don't.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.460]   And I heard so many horror stories
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.940]   about do-it-yourself investors who are bogleheads.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   And when the person who is the do-it-yourselfer passes,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:49.780]   some person who is very friendly to the spouse
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.900]   sits down and, "How's it going?"
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.540]   And often the spouse would say, "It's not going well.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.380]   "I've got all this stuff.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.780]   "I've got all these accounts."
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.500]   Oh, let me introduce you to my person.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.380]   They're really, really good.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.860]   They work for XYZ brokerage firm or whatever.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.900]   And they're excellent.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.980]   And the next thing you know,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.020]   the do-it-yourself boglehead is rolling over
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.220]   in his or her grave
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.980]   because the spouse is going to the exact people
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.220]   they've been telling them their whole life to avoid.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.620]   What are your suggestions on that?
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.180]   - If you are seeking financial planning assistance,
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.660]   my general guidance is firstly,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.980]   decide what services do you want.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.500]   And broadly, I divide this into two categories.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.060]   There's investment management, right?
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.180]   The person who's actually going to be placing the trades,
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.220]   rebalancing the portfolio and so on.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.180]   And then separately, there is financial planning,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.220]   which is all of the advice.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.340]   And maybe you want both of those,
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.260]   or maybe you just want investment management,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.740]   or maybe you just want the financial planning.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.980]   Any of the above is fine,
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.500]   but first decide what it is that you want
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.300]   because some providers do only one,
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.100]   some do just the other, and some do both.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:14.100]   And as an example, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.220]   Obviously, as bogleheads, many of us use Vanguard,
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.780]   and so that might be a first place someone would look.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.140]   They provide investment management
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.460]   for a fee that is much lower than many other places.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.860]   The financial planning that's included is pretty limited.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.220]   It's mostly investment management.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.100]   There's some advice, but it's not super duper in-depth.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.300]   And so that could be a great place
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   if you're looking for just the investment management.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.820]   Conversely, if you're looking for just the advice,
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:50.060]   then the new term for that is advice only.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.980]   You would look for an advice only financial planner.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.780]   And then conversely, if you want both,
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.140]   then there isn't exactly a term for that,
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.460]   but frankly, that's what most
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.820]   smaller financial planning firms,
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.860]   that is what they provide.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.460]   In most cases, they're gonna be doing
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.660]   the investment management and financial planning.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.780]   So that's step number one is just figure out
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.340]   what do you want.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.340]   Step number two is what areas of expertise are you seeking?
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.660]   A surviving spouse in your 70s, for instance,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.500]   the areas of expertise, you want somebody
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.060]   who's skilled with retirement tax planning
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.100]   and managing a retirement portfolio.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.980]   Whereas if you're a surviving spouse at age 33
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.100]   with young kids, it's a completely different list of topics.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.420]   And so you want somebody who's got the right expertise.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.020]   And then lastly is just how do you wanna pay for it?
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.820]   There's a lot of choices here, right?
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.300]   There's the old school commission method
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.220]   through a broker dealer, and mostly as bogleheads,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.100]   that's what we try to avoid.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.700]   There's assets under management fees.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.940]   There's flat fees.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.820]   There's hourly fees.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.740]   There's all these different choices.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.380]   They come with various conflicts of interest,
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.780]   frankly, in most cases,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.700]   but separate from the conflicts of interest,
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.820]   you just wanna take the time to do the math.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.860]   If you're considering an assets under management base fee,
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.740]   how much is that in dollars for your portfolio?
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.220]   It might be less than a flat fee.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.300]   It might be a lot more.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.580]   Just do the math.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.980]   And so those are the broad pieces of advice
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.820]   that I would give for somebody looking for financial advice.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.420]   I have to throw this in there.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.540]   People who have listened to my podcast have heard it before.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.300]   I've been in the business now for 36 years.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.500]   And I used to say,
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.340]   I have been told many, many times by many people,
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.940]   "Rick, I'm a do-it-yourself investor,
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.460]   "but I've told my spouse that when I die,
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.940]   "they're gonna contact you."
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.620]   And I say to them, "Well, that's great,
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.500]   "but unless I have a conversation with them
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.060]   "before you die and you make the introduction,
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.140]   "it isn't gonna happen."
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.700]   Because in the 30 some odd years that I have been doing this,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.020]   I have never once received a phone call, ever.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:10.180]   Not once received a phone call from a surviving spouse
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.980]   that I didn't know personally
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.940]   and that I hadn't had a conversation with.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.820]   Until last year.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.300]   And I actually got a phone call from a surviving spouse.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.980]   My first one.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.460]   At 36 years in the business, first one who said,
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.940]   "My husband said that I should contact you
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.540]   "if something happened.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.860]   "And so here I am."
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.420]   For the do-it-yourself people,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:40.420]   if you really want your spouse to go to Vanguard,
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.220]   as an example, there are others out there,
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.660]   but just as an example, to manage the money.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.700]   You have to have that relationship established
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.940]   before you die.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.140]   Before you die.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.980]   Your spouse has to be familiar with it.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.940]   They have to understand it.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.700]   They have to have talked to the people.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.020]   They have to be comfortable with it
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.340]   so that when they're sitting down with their friend,
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.100]   having a general discussion about how things are going
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.020]   and this comes up, or maybe it won't even come up
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.340]   because it's been taken care of.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.340]   And so your spouse won't end up in that very place
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.540]   where you did not want them to go.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.820]   - Yeah, absolutely agree.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.460]   Establish the relationship beforehand.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.460]   - A couple more things I wanna talk about before we end,
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.820]   and these are kind of one-off topics,
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.500]   but this is very confusing.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.180]   Inheriting IRAs for spouses,
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.940]   inheriting IRAs for non-spouses.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.940]   It just seems like the IRS is just making this thing
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:33.900]   all so complicated.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.860]   Could you just go through it for us a little bit?
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.300]   - Yes, this topic was complicated
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.340]   when I started working in this field,
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.700]   and then it got more complicated with the Secure Act,
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.980]   and then it has become even more complicated
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.020]   with various IRS regulations.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:54.020]   So I will say, frankly, I think this is an important message
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:58.020]   that most tax professionals I know, including myself,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.860]   don't even try to memorize all of the rules.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.300]   We have sources that we know to go to
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.020]   to look up the appropriate rules
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.140]   in a given set of circumstances.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.700]   The general idea in today's world
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.700]   is if you inherit an IRA as a spouse,
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.300]   you have choice number one,
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.340]   and this is a choice that only surviving spouses have,
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.980]   is that you can just roll the IRA into your own IRA,
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.860]   and then it's as if it had been your IRA to begin with.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.540]   The fact that it's inherited is no longer relevant at all.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.540]   And, again, you can only do that
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.140]   if you're inheriting it as a surviving spouse.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.900]   If you're inheriting an IRA from your parent,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.940]   or grandparent, or aunt, or uncle, or whoever,
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.300]   you don't have that choice.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.540]   The second option that you have as a surviving spouse
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   is to just leave the account as an inherited IRA.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.620]   And the rules for inherited IRAs
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.220]   in terms of the distributions
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.460]   and how much you have to take as an RMD every year
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.660]   depend on a lot of factors.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   The first factor is, is the beneficiary,
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.100]   so are you, if you're the person who inherited this IRA,
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.540]   are you an eligible designated beneficiary?
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.380]   And that includes surviving spouses,
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.660]   people who are disabled,
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.940]   anyone who is less than 10 years younger
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.780]   than the original owner,
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.940]   so that also includes anybody
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.860]   who is older than the original owner.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.060]   So if, for instance, you inherit an IRA
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.220]   from your younger sibling,
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.020]   you're an eligible designated beneficiary.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.220]   And so people in that category
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.420]   have kind of like the old rules,
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.620]   where it's a stretch over their life.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.460]   We're taking distributions based on life expectancy.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.300]   Anyone not in that category,
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.420]   which in most cases includes kids,
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.340]   if you inherit an IRA from your parents,
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.220]   most likely you're not in that category.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.940]   You're a non-eligible designated beneficiary,
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.780]   most of the time.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   - Nieces, nephews.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.580]   - Yes, yep, or grandkids or whoever.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.300]   And in that case, we have a rule
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.740]   that says that the account has to be distributed
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.220]   within 10 years.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:21.660]   Now, the thing that's newest here
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.700]   is there's now also a rule
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.020]   that if the original owner,
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.940]   the deceased original owner,
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.660]   had reached their required beginning date,
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.820]   so they already had to be taking RMDs,
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.140]   then in addition to needing to distribute the account
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.500]   over 10 years,
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   you also need to take life expectancy-based distributions
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.340]   over those 10 years.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.980]   You have to meet both of those requirements.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.660]   And that's a new thing as a result of IRS regulations
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.620]   that only became effective in 2025.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.500]   - But you don't have to use the deceased's age
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.460]   to take the required minimum distribution.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.940]   You do have the choice of using your own age, correct?
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.780]   - In that last example, that's correct.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.660]   There are some cases
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.540]   in which the deceased's person's age is still relevant.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.940]   One of them, by the way, is in the year of death,
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.980]   if the deceased had to take an RMD
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.540]   and had not yet taken it,
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.540]   then the beneficiaries in some combination
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.180]   will have to take that RMD,
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.300]   calculated as if that person were still alive for that year.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:28.300]   - And this RMD does not go into the deceased's estate.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.580]   - Right.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.820]   - It basically goes to the beneficiary, correct?
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.660]   - Yep.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.020]   - So it's taxable to the beneficiary,
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.140]   not taxable to the estate if they didn't take it yet.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.380]   - Right, there could be an exception
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.300]   if the estate itself is the beneficiary of the IRA.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.740]   Sorry, there's always exceptions.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.740]   - One more scenario and then we're gonna stop.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.740]   You inherit an inherited IRA.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.740]   The person who died had an inherited IRA
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.940]   from an uncle or an aunt or whatever.
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.220]   And now you inherit that inherited IRA.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.380]   And how does that work?
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:09.540]   - In that case, you are known as a successor beneficiary.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.340]   And the rules in that case are extremely complicated.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.180]   - Okay.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:21.140]   - We need to know, did the original owner die before
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.040]   or after the SECURE Act went into effect?
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.500]   And then we need to know, did the beneficiary,
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.060]   so 'cause now at least one beneficiary has died
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.700]   because you're a successor beneficiary.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.180]   Did that person die before or after
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.420]   the SECURE Act went into effect?
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.180]   And then we need to know, was the beneficiary
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:47.320]   an eligible designated beneficiary or not?
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.180]   And then we also need to know, did the owner die before
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.780]   or after their required beginning date?
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.380]   So the point at which they needed to start taking RMDs.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.500]   So it's essentially like a big flow chart.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.700]   And depending on all of the answers to those questions,
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.060]   then we can determine the answer.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.780]   And in some cases, we're going to have an answer
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:09.200]   in which the successor beneficiary is basically
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.100]   just finishing out the initial 10-year period.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.740]   In other cases, it's going to be the 10-year rule
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   kicks in for the first time.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.140]   And so it's starting at that point.
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.580]   It's extremely complicated.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.660]   So for sure, consult a tax professional.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.140]   - Not easy stuff, not at all.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.660]   Well, we've covered a lot of ground in this podcast.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.980]   Do you have any parting words, Mike?
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.020]   - Just what we started with, I think,
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.900]   which is if you were a surviving spouse,
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.340]   there's a lot you're going to have to do,
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.180]   but you don't have to do all of it immediately.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.380]   The things that you do need to start on immediately,
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.940]   sure, go ahead and get started.
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.920]   But the really big decisions, a lot of them,
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.700]   you don't need to rush them.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.940]   And it's okay to get professional help
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.660]   as well as help from family members.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.100]   - Well, Mike, thanks so much for being with us today
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.980]   for this complicated but vital information.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.820]   - Thank you for having me back.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.980]   It was a pleasure to be on the podcast again.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.060]   - This concludes this episode of Bogleheads on Investing.
