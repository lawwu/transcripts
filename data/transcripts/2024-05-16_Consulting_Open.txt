[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hey Radicals, quick announcement that I am opening up a sale on consulting appointments
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   A spring sale.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.260]   A few of you have been writing me emails recently saying, "Hey Josh, when are we going
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.040]   to get the calendar back open?"
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240]   And I'm here today to announce that yes, it's officially back open and I am running a spring
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.080]   sale on consulting calls.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.480]   If you would like to speak to me, if you'd like to book a private consultation with me,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.200]   that is available for you here during the last week of May and the first week of June.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   Last week of May, first week of June for the spring sale on consulting, reduced rate, $100
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.800]   off my normal rate for you.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.160]   Hopefully that will incentivize you to book now and fill up my calendar there during those
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   two weeks.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.400]   I've added 50 total appointments to the calendar for you.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.360]   So try to make the times varied.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   Some are early, some are late, some are... try to make them widely available so they
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   work.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   Usually I get clients from all around the world, all different phone time zones, everything
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720]   like that.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   It all works for you and is very convenient for you to book a call with me.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.520]   I would love to speak with you here at the end of May and the beginning of June.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.040]   A couple of comments just on what you can expect from that.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.560]   Basically it's going to be a private consultation with me.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.020]   If you would like to talk about financial planning, I can help you with financial planning.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.360]   What I do in those cases, I have you send me your documents in advance and I look through
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.200]   them and I'm ready to go to cover the aspects of your financial planning.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.920]   A lot of times people use me as a sounding board to talk about the advice they're receiving
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.600]   from other people, how it applies.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840]   I'm really good at that, able to do a good job of saying, "Yep, this is absolutely great
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.920]   advice and here's why" or "Not so great, might be good for someone else but not the best
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   thing for you."
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.780]   That's a very useful function.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.440]   We can talk about any aspect of financial planning or about life.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.920]   I'm an open book.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640]   You know what I talk about here on the show.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.240]   You shouldn't book me if you don't listen to the show.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.460]   If you listen to the show, you'll know what I'm good at, what I can talk to you about.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.480]   If you would like to book a consulting call, you can do that by going to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
