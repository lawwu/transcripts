[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   [Music]
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.880]   Fasting is the act of going without food for a certain amount of time.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320]   The act is not distinctly Christian, nor is it distinctly spiritual either.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.000]   It could just be a physical act.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.640]   And so, Pastor John, we get questions all the time about Christian fasting.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.860]   What is it and why do we do it?
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.360]   And how would you frame this discussion and introduce Christian fasting?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   Well, first of all, let's define fasting.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.160]   There's, I think, a pretty generally accepted definition of fasting among Christians over
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.400]   the centuries.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:51.240]   Fasting is a temporary renunciation of something that is in itself good, like food, in order
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:04.840]   to intensify our expression of need for something greater, namely God and his work in our lives.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:16.240]   Now, defined like that, fasting is not explicitly commanded in the Bible for Christians.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.260]   Fasting doesn't have the same place in Christianity that it does, for example, in Islam.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.120]   The fasting that Muslims do during the month of Ramadan in Islam is a requirement of every
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   real Muslim.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.420]   You can't really claim to be a Muslim if you say, "I'm just not going to do Ramadan."
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.200]   Fasting doesn't have that kind of place in Christianity, but even though there's no command
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   to fast in the New Testament, nevertheless, there are indications that it was normal and
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.700]   that Jesus expected it would happen among his followers.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.240]   For example, in Matthew 6, verses 16 to 18, Jesus says, "When you fast, do not look gloomy
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.000]   like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces, that their fasting may be seen by others.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   Truly, I say to you, they have their reward.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   But when you fast, anoint your head, wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.680]   by others, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father who is in secret will reward
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.920]   you."
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.520]   So several things stand out in that passage.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.400]   One is that Jesus says, "When you fast," not, "If you fast."
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   That's what I mean when I say it seems that he expects that his followers will be fasting.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.720]   But even more clear in this passage is that Jesus insisted that our fasting not be for
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.640]   the sake of impressing other people.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   In fact, we should go out of our way, he says, as much as possible—like washing our face,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.160]   combing our hair—go out of our way to keep other people from knowing that we are fasting.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   And that gives fasting for Christians a radically Godward focus.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   And in that sense, fasting is a great test and confirmation that God is real to us, since
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.320]   in many situations, God is the only person who knows you're fasting, and the discipline
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.920]   can't impress anybody, and all it can do is test whether you and God are really having
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   a transaction here.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.800]   Another important passage for the meaning of Christian fasting is Matthew 9, 14-17.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:05.040]   Jesus compares the old pre-Christian fasting to old wineskins, and the fasting that his
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.960]   disciples will be doing as new wine that won't fit into the old wineskins.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.820]   It blows them up.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.160]   In other words, there's something new about Christian fasting that sets it apart from
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.200]   the Old Testament fasting.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.920]   They're not the same thing.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:34.360]   So here's what he says, "Then the disciples came to John, asking him, 'Why do we and
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.920]   the Pharisees fast, but your disciples, Jesus, do not fast?'
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.740]   And Jesus said to them, 'Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.620]   with them?
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.040]   The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.840]   No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or the patch tears away from
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.960]   the garment, and a worse tear is made.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   Neither is new wine put into old wineskins.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.540]   If it is, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.280]   But the new wine is put in fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved."
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:29.900]   So Jesus says that his disciples are not fasting while he's with them.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.200]   He's the bridegroom present.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.000]   We don't fast when the bridegroom is there.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.840]   Now, when he's gone away, he says, which he has, he's gone back into heaven, then the
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.000]   disciples will fast.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.640]   And what that seems to indicate is that Christian fasting is a kind of, or a way of, expressing
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.000]   our longing for the bridegroom, Jesus Christ, our King, to return.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.440]   That's the connection between the fasting and the second coming of Christ.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:12.280]   One of the meanings of Christian fasting is that we are expressing our hunger for the
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.400]   Lord Jesus to come back and to take up his kingship in this world.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:26.200]   And what sets Christian fasting apart as unique, new wine that can't fit into the old wineskins,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.800]   is that Christ has already come.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.520]   The bridegroom, the King, has already been here.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.300]   We have seen him and known him.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.160]   We love him because we've tasted of his presence.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.180]   We have already tasted the presence of the kingship of Jesus.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.520]   So Christian fasting is not merely hoping and longing and hungering and aching for something
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   future.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's based on an already and not just a not yet.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.440]   The King has come.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.840]   He's died for sins.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.360]   He's risen from the dead.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   He's gone away into heaven.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.660]   We already have the down payment in our hearts of his presence and his spirit, but we long
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.960]   and we hunger for the consummation, for the day of his return, his coming and reigning.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.360]   So Christian fasting is unique in all the fasting of the world.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.840]   It's unique in that it expresses more than longing for Christ or a hunger for Christ's
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   presence.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:41.680]   It's a hunger that is rooted in, based on, an already present, experienced reality of
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   Christ in history and in our hearts.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:52.560]   Let me give one more passage that gets at the meaning of what fasting is for Christians.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.760]   In the book of Acts, chapter 13, verses 1 to 3, there's this beautiful illustration
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:08.040]   of how fasting became instrumental in the shaping or the laying hold of God for the
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.160]   shaping of world-changing ministry.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   Here's what it says.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.400]   "Now there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon, who
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.120]   is called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manian, a longtime friend of Herod the Tetrarch, and
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.760]   Saul," or another name, Paul.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:36.000]   "While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.960]   for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:47.880]   And then, after fasting," some more, "and praying, they laid hands on them and sent
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   them off."
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.480]   So, the leaders of the church were fasting, it seems, in order to express to God their
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:06.240]   own need and longing and desire with their bodies for God's guidance in missionary breakthroughs.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.800]   And God responded with an answer that totally transformed the world, seriously, because
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.440]   the mission of Barnabas and Saul, or Paul, was one of the most important missionary endeavors
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.800]   in the history of the world, because the advancement of the gospel broke into the Western Roman
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.720]   Empire and nothing in the world has ever been the same since that breakthrough.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:42.600]   So let me summarize the heart of Christian fasting and why we Christians do it.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:51.120]   One way to say it is that fasting is the hungry Christian handmade of faith.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.080]   Fasting is not a replacement for faith in Jesus.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.260]   It's a servant of faith in Jesus.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:04.280]   Fasting is a way of saying with our stomach and our whole body how much we need and want
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.720]   and trust Jesus.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.640]   It's a way of saying that we're not going to be enslaved by food as the source of our
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.440]   satisfaction.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.080]   We will use the renunciation of food from time to time to express that Jesus is better
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   than food.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.280]   Jesus is more needful than food.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.120]   Food is good.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.480]   Let there be no mistake about this.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.280]   We're not ascetics in that we deny the goodness of God's creation.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   Food is good.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:40.640]   It is a gift of God, and we glorify God with it in two ways, not just one way.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:50.000]   We feast on it with gratitude for God's goodness, and we forfeit food out of hunger for God
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.080]   himself.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.720]   When we feast, we gladly taste the emblem, the emblem of our heavenly food, the bread
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.480]   of life, Jesus himself.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:08.760]   And when we fast, we say, "I love the reality more than I love the emblem."
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.860]   Both feasting and fasting are worship for the Christian.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.460]   Both magnify Christ, and of course, both have their peculiar dangers.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.680]   The danger of feasting is that we fall in love with the gift, and the danger of fasting
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.920]   is that we belittle the gift and boast in our willpower, our discipline.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.960]   But at its best, Christian fasting is not a belittling of the good gift of food.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.680]   It's simply a heartfelt, body-felt exclamation point.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.760]   At the end of the sentence, "I love you, God.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.680]   I need you more than I need food, more than I need life."
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   Amen.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.560]   And speaking of food and overeating and gluttony and spiritual side of weight loss, we have
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.360]   four other episodes on the topic, and two recent ones.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:16.160]   See episodes 785, 752, 321, and 123, all in our online archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.120]   And you can find Pastor John's book on fasting, A Hunger for God, is the title, online for
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.880]   free at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.120]   So why do Christians go to church, and why do we go on Sundays?
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.160]   Pastor John will take a stab at that question tomorrow.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.200]   No questions, no answers are assumed on this podcast, so please keep them coming our way,
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.320]   no matter how simple those questions seem to you.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.160]   I'll see you tomorrow.
