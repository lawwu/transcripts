[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Pastor John, assuming that someone is persuaded by the last podcast, in episode 204,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   that God can will that sin be without Himself sinning,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   how does such a conviction bring comfort to the Christian life?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The truth of God's sovereignty over sin,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   my sin, the world's sin, and over all the evil in the world,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   creates a problem for some people.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   In the end, for those who rest in it, see it in the Bible,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   believe that God is their Father through Jesus Christ,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   for them, for me, we find this doctrine to be of enormous comfort,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   enormous helpfulness in the face of the worst things in the world
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   because a couple of reasons.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   If He's not there, and things are happening random,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   then we are the victim of meaninglessness to the core of all things.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And I know there are people who would rather live with that
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   than live with a God of purposefulness, but I wouldn't.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I believe that far deeper hope is given to those who've lost loved ones
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and to those who are struck down with some terrible calamity.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Far deeper hope is given to say, "This was not meaningless.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   This will prove to do something beyond all your imagination for your good
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   if you will trust the living God and receive His Son as your Lord and Savior."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   The second thing is, just in principle, if God is so weak or so evil or so foolish
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   that He cannot cause an earthquake not to happen
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   or a plane not to fly into the side of a building,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   then His weakness or His ignorance or His malevolence
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   will never be a comfort to me in all the challenges that I face in life.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   In other words, by getting God off the hook of causality,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   we hang ourselves on helplessness.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And so I think if people will stay with this God, meditate long and hard,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   see His face in the face of Jesus Christ, loving them and dying for them,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   they will in the end find that His sovereignty is one of the sweetest comforts they have ever known.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yes. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And from Warren, "John Piper's personal testimony of comfort,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   of God's sovereignty in his life in the midst of one of his darkest personal trials."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   See his book, "The Pleasures of God," chapter 2,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and especially that final subsection on pages 58 and 59 of the 2012 edition of that book.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Again, the book is "The Pleasures of God."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
