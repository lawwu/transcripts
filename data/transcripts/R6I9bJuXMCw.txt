[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   In the following sermon, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the book of Acts, chapter 7, verses 17 to 20.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Now, I must again remind you of the whole setting of this statement.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   It was a statement made by a man called Stephen. He was the first Christian martyr.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Here we find him on trial, arraigned before the court, the great high court of Jerusalem, which was known as the Sanhedrin.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   He is on trial because he is a Christian, because he is a preacher, and because he is engaged in Christian activity.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   That causes the members of the Sanhedrin, who are very religious people, very religious Jews,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and the leaders amongst the Jewish people, religiously, politically, and in every other respect,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   that leads them to bring a charge against those men of blasphemy.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   They say that he is speaking against the temple, speaking against Moses and the law,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   but the real charge that they bring against him is that he, like all other Christian preachers, was preaching this Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   That was the message of the early preachers, Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   They all said that this Jesus of Nazareth, who had been crucified on a cross and had died and had been buried, had risen again.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He had come out of the grave in the body, and he had manifested himself to certain chosen followers and disciples,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and then in the presence of some of them he descended into heaven,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and from heaven he had sent down upon them on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   All that is described in the earlier chapters of this book.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And they proceeded to preach and to do wonders and miracles in his name, and it was because of that they got into trouble.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And here is this man, Stephen, arraigned before the court for these reasons.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And we read in the first verse, "Then said the high priest, 'Are these things so?'"
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   In other words, they turn to him and say, "What have you got to say for yourself?"
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And Stephen replies.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And his reply, as we've been seeing on a number of Sunday evenings, is a kind of recapitulation of the main elements in the history of the Jews.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   He's addressing Jews, so he takes them over their own history.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   His object, of course, is to show them that what they are so proud of, they've completely misunderstood.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   They don't understand their own history.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   They've always failed to do so.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   He brings this point home to them.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   They're only repeating what their forefathers have always done.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They're always opposing God and his plan of salvation.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   They've done it from the beginning, and he goes over the history in order to show them that.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You see, his point is that God has got a great plan and purpose of salvation for this world.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And so he takes them back, starts with Abraham, shows how God made a covenant with Abraham, this covenant of salvation,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and what Abraham had to endure because of that.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Then he takes up the case of Joseph, shows the same thing.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And now he comes to this, his third case, which is that of Moses
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and the deliverance of the children of Israel from the terrible bondage and captivity which they had endured in the land of Egypt.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And that's the one we are concentrating on at the moment.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now, I say that Stephen's main object is just this, is to show that Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   the one whom he believes in and whom he preaches, is the fulfillment of all that had been promised in the Old Testament.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Abraham foresaw this day and looked to him.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Joseph is the type of him, and Moses is the type of him.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   In other words, Stephen shows them at one and the same time these two things,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   that in rejecting Jesus Christ and his message, they are just repeating the same old error of their fathers,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   their blind to spiritual truth.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But at the same time, it does afford him a wonderful opportunity of stating what the gospel is,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   what God's purpose of redemption actually is.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Well, now then, we are using it in exactly the same way.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   We are not just interested in this out of a mere historical or antiquarian interest.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We are interested in it because it is the very message, surely, that is needed at the present time.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   The majority of people in this country, the vast majority of people in this country,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   are not interested in this gospel.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   They dismiss it. They reject it, even as the Sanhedrin did.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Why? Well, because, again, they are ignorant and because they make the same mistakes
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   and they are guilty of the same misunderstanding.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And they need precisely the same message, the same presentation of the gospel,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   as was needed by the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And that is precisely what we are doing.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And we are doing it in the case of Moses in this particular way.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I'm trying to show how, here, in the very introduction to this story of Moses,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   the case of the people who call themselves humanists is dealt with in a very wonderful and in a very perfect manner.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You see, we haven't really started considering the story of Moses.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We are dealing with this preamble that Stephen gives here,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and which is a summary of the early chapters of the book of Exodus,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   of the story, or to the story, of Moses.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And in an extraordinary way.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   He so puts it that he brings out the principles which deal directly
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   with the whole opposition of people who call themselves humanists.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Intellectuals, use any term you like, at the present time.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now, you realize the main position taken up by these people is this,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   that they base everything upon man, humanists.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Especially upon the mind of men, the reason of men, the understanding of men, man's ability.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Man's mind, to them, is the measure of everything.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And so they dismiss all religions as being just the creations of ignorant people in the past.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   They're prepared to be kind to us, and to say that, of course, people are creatures of their age,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and they didn't know very much better in those times, and it was natural, therefore, that they should have been religious.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And in their ignorance and superstition, they were always ready to believe in the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   But, of course, by now, we with all our scientific knowledge, we know
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   that all these things are quite impossible, it's all nonsense.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Of course, we can explain them psychologically, and we mustn't be too hard on them,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   but what we do resent, they say, is this, that you should still expect us, at the present time, to believe that old story.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Now, that's their position.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   They think it's insulting to ask the sophisticated, modern, educated, scientific men
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   to believe this old gospel, which is frankly supernatural and miraculous,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and which proclaims itself to be the power of God, and to salvation.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Now, then, that's the case of the humanists.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I want to show you how this is answered here, in a most extraordinary manner.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   We've already seen a great deal.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   The first point is, of course, the misunderstanding of history.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, that's God in history.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   They've never seen that, they don't understand that.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You can't understand history apart from that, but they try to.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's their first leading error.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Secondly, the humanist, of course, is a humanist,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   because he's never seen the depth of the problem by which he's confronted.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   A man who thinks that education can solve the problems of life and of living,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   is a man who's confessing he's never understood the problem of sin.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Never, he can't have.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   If he had realized the depth of the problem,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   he wouldn't have such confidence in human understanding and ability and logic and willpower.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   He'd know that he's a failure, and that you need something bigger and greater.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So we came last Sunday night to this.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We showed how, here, Stephen emphasizes the fact that it is God's power that alone can deliver.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abram,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   the people grew and multiplied in Egypt.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And I was able to show you how the 105th Psalm in verses 24 and 25 tells us
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that it was God who caused them to grow.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   This wasn't an accidental increase in the population.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It wasn't the application of any rudimentary science that they had at the present time
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   giving the right hormones.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   They didn't know anything about that. No, no, this was a miracle.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   God did this.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   God caused the people to grow and to multiply in a phenomenal, in a supernatural manner.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It was preternatural.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's the statement.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And then we saw how God could take this king that arose that knew not Joseph
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   and use him and employ him to his own end.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   The point is, it is the power of God.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   He causes Moses to be born at the right minute.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   He causes the daughter of Pharaoh to take a walk at the right time
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   to see this little child there floating on the river
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and to take him and adopt him and bring him up as her own child.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   None of these things are accidental.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It is all the purpose of God.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It is the power of God.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   My dear friends, I can't go on without reiterating this and reemphasizing it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   This gospel is miraculous.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It is supernatural.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It isn't a gospel if it isn't.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Certainly, would it not be a gospel if it isn't divine and supernatural and miraculous?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It wouldn't even work.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   If this is only another human message,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   well then I'm wasting my breath and my energy and wasting your time.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   No, no.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   This is God's power unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now, that's the thing that we were emphasizing last Sunday night.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But now I want to show you another side of this.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The Apostle Paul, you noticed in writing to those Corinthians, said
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   that the gospel is not only the power of God, but also the wisdom of God.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Those are the two points he keeps on repeating.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   but unto us which are saved Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   These are the two things that he emphasizes most of all about the gospel.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And I want to show you how in this whole story,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   this other aspect of the gospel and its method is also brought out very clearly.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   The wisdom of God.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Not only his power, but the wisdom of God.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   All this is what makes it such a privilege to offer such a message to you.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   We are living in a world which is in terrible trouble.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I'm not here to criticize the statesmen and the philosophers and the sociologists,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   educationalists and all who are doing their utmost.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I am here to say this, that it must be clear to all of us that all their efforts are of no avail.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And I'm here to give you God's wisdom on this very predicament,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   this very position that confronts us.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It's the wisdom of God.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   But now, once more, as I say that,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I know that there is no aspect of the gospel that is perhaps more ridiculed
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   by the so-called humanists and others than this very aspect of the wisdom of God.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   You see, they think, as I've been indicating, that they're very modern in doing that.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   But they're not.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   The apostle wrote to those Corinthians 1,900 years ago, and he said,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   "Of course, I know that all this to the Greeks is foolishness, nonsense."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And that's what the modern man says.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Fancies are still believing that old gospel with all that we know.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Fancies still believe--what utter rubbish!
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   How pathetic! Foolishness!
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But, my dear friends, the Greeks said it 1,900 years ago.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   They dismiss it all as being folly, foolishness, nonsense,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   something that you can't expect an intelligent, educated man to believe.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   But I want to show you this evening what the apostle said there to those Corinthians,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   that God, by this which they regard as being so foolish,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   is demonstrating their folly to them.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   This is how he puts it, you remember.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   "It is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.'"
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And then he issues a challenge.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Where is the wise?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Where is the scribe?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Where is the disputer of this world?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Let him come forward.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Let him listen.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And that's precisely what God has done in the gospel.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   He has made the wisdom of man look utterly foolish.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   He's turned it upside down.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   As Paul goes on there to say at the end of that chapter,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "God has chosen the method which will do this very thing."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   He says, "You see, you're calling, brethren,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   that not many wise men after the flesh,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   not many mighty, not many noble are called.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and base things of the world,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and things which are not, to bring to naught the things that are,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   that no flesh should glory in his presence.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Wisdom?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The Greeks are seeking after wisdom, and they reject the wisdom of God.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   That's where they show they're utter folly.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well, now then, let me put this to you in modern language.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The gospel exposes the wisdom of this world as unutterable folly.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   How? Well, in some such way as this.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It shows very plainly, and it's the only thing that does show,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   that the modern man, with all his boasting and all his claims,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   is a miserable and a wretched failure,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   and that he doesn't recognize that.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   You see, it's only the gospel that tells people that.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Your Sunday newspapers don't tell you that. They praise you.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   They make you think you're wonderful, and you've read the learned articles,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and you think you're sophisticated, and you know such a lot.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   They're all building you up. You wouldn't buy them if they didn't.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That's how they do it, you see. They please you. They play up to you.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And there the whole world is praising us, telling us how wonderful we are,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   boasting of our great achievements.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But here is a message that tells us about our own failure,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and shows us that we don't recognize our failure.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Is there anything which is more insane
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   than the fact that men and women should be bursting about themselves
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   with the world as it is tonight?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   This is blindness. The world is a wretched failure,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and it doesn't recognize it.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It boasts about its wisdom, and it's blind to its own miserable failure.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But secondly, it doesn't realize that the cause of its failure
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   is its wrong thinking.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   You see, we pride ourselves as modern men above everything else on our thinking.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   We are the thinkers. Superstitious in the past.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Emotionalists in the past. Those religious people particularly.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   They've just taken the dope and the opium of the people.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   They've stopped thinking. But we are thinkers. Rationalists.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Ah, that's the thing. If you really want to be up to date,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   you join the Rationalist Press Association or something like that.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You're a humanist. You believe in man's capacity for thinking.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   You see, it's all due to this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   They haven't realized that the main cause of their failure in life and living
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   is precisely their wrong and their faulty thinking.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   As a man thinks, so he is, and so he does.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   The trouble with the world tonight is wrong thinking.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And the first business of the Gospel is to get people to think.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   To present truth to them, and to make them contemplate it and think about it.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It doesn't merely utter clichés.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It has a view, a total view, of life and of history,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and of all things as I'm trying to show you.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   But the Rationalist, the humanist, he doesn't realize that his failure is due to his wrong thinking.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And so, thirdly, the humanist is foolish enough,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   with his fatal self-confidence and belief in the human mind and the human understanding,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   he is foolish enough, he is mad enough to think that he can understand
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   the mind of the infinite God.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   He thinks that he can look round the mind of God,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   that he can analyze and dissect and understand the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   That he is able to dissect what Thomas Carlyle called "infinities and immensities."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   This isn't mere arrogance, it's pathetic, it's tragic,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   that men, finite little men who can't manage his own life nor understand himself,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   leave alone the universe,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   claims that he must have an understanding of the mind of God,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and he says he's not going to believe anything unless he can fully understand it.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And so, he remains a miserable sinner and a miserable failure,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   because he won't accept a gospel that is divine, miraculous and supernatural,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and which can save him.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's the whole essence of his trouble.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   So, you see, the modern man, your humanist, he dismisses the most glorious,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   the most wonderful message that has ever come into the world.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   This gospel which tells us about God's wisdom, love and power,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   all incarnate in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Now, the world, you see, dismisses this.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But this is the wisdom of God.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   How do we see this? How does it show itself?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   How is this wisdom of God shown in this salvation?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Well, now, let's go back to our story, because here it is for us.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   The first point I would therefore put to you is the mystery,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   or the unexpectedness of God's ways in salvation.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   The mystery, the unexpectedness.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   God does things in such a way that the modern man, the mind of men,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   can't understand. It's amazed and astonished.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   God, as Paul tells those Corinthians there at the end of that first chapter of the first epistle,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   he turns everything upside down.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The wise put down, the ignorant put up.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   The things that are become nothing, and nobody becomes something.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   God has reversed everything.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   As it was charged, you remember again some of these Christians later on in this book of Acts,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   they were described as these men that have turned the world upside down, have come hither.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And that's precisely what Christianity does.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   It turns your world right upside down.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   All you know and learn outside is reversed when you come in here.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   This always surprises, it amazes, it's unexpected, it's unusual.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It is a great mystery.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   How do we see that?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Well, the first respect in which it's shown is this.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And it's an extraordinary thing this.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   The indirectness of God's method.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Of course we practical men, hard-headed men of the 20th century, direct action.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   God never does things like that, he's always indirect.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   God is always apparently doing the exact opposite of what you think he should be doing.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Poor men don't understand it, and they don't like this.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It doesn't conform to their neat little plans and systems.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   These little systems which have their day and have their day and cease to be, and so on.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Now, the indirectness.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You notice it here, in this problem of the children of Israel down in Egypt.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   The way that God devised to bring them out is most unusual and most unexpected.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You would have expected him, wouldn't you, to have given a great demonstration of his power
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   and brought them out like that at once. He didn't do that.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Quite an involved process.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   All the long story about Moses and all the rest of it, which we hope to be dealing with.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   The indirectness, keep your eye on that.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But secondly, we find here that God used this Pharaoh, this king of Egypt, a bad man, a dictator, an evil man.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   He evil-treated the children of Israel.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Yes, but we were able to demonstrate to you last Sunday night,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and especially in the light of the statement made in Psalm 105,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   that it was God who made him do this.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   We read in verse 24, "He increased his people greatly, he made them stronger than their enemies.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with their servants."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now this is the thing, you see, that your clever men with his wealthy wisdom simply cannot understand.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   God used this evil man, Pharaoh, to bring his own purposes to pass.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   That's how he surprises us.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   You say, "God can't possibly use a man like that." God did use a man like that.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   You read your Bible, you'll find God has used many strange people to bring his purposes to pass.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Many strange people, many strange characters have been used.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   You would have expected God to choose Esau rather than Jacob.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   So would I, but we are so foolish, we are so wrong.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   It's the Jacobs that God chooses and uses.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And then another thing, and this is perhaps more remarkable still,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   that these children of Israel, we are told here, had to suffer terribly.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   They were evil and treated by the Egyptians and by Pharaoh,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   so that they cast out their young children to the end that they might not live.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But you see, we have already been told, and Stephen is repeating here,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   that it was God that made the Egyptians do that.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   It was God who turned the Egyptians against the children of Israel,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   as he had turned the heart of Pharaoh against the children of Israel.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He put them into terrible trouble, he made them most unhappy.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Indeed, it looked at one point as if they were coming to the end of their story.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   They were at the point almost of extermination.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And it was God who did it all.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It was God who put it into the hearts of Pharaoh and the people to do this very thing.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And here are his own people suffering in agonies,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   almost at the point of despair, at the point of extermination.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   God has done it all.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Not surprising, is it, that we are dealing with a wisdom that we can't follow?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   This to us appears to be utter rubbish, this seems sheer nonsense.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   God's doing the exact opposite of what we would have expected.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   And then, you see, you come to the end of the story, suddenly, unexpectedly.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   God acts in deliverance, in which time Moses was born.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Now, here is a typical statement of this whole aspect of the mystery,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and the unexpectedness, and the inscrutability,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   of the mind and the wisdom of God, whose ways are past understanding.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Now, this is a great theme in the Bible.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And if we don't grasp this, it's not surprising that we don't believe the gospel.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   The scripture is full of this.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   You know, God not only surprises his enemies, he surprises his own people and his own friends.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   This is a great statement made by Isaiah.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Isaiah could see trouble coming, and then God revealed to him his plan in it all,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and what he was going to do about it.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And Isaiah bursts out, what else could he say?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   How difficult it is, he says, to understand you, your ways of past finding out.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I don't understand.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And God gave him a message back.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts and your thoughts,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and my ways and your ways."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And yet, puny man, in his ignorance and failure, he wants to understand,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and God baffles him.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He mystifies him.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Now, this is a great principle, which is taught everywhere in the Bible,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   in the Old Testament, and in the New.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Take one illustration only of it in the New.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Our Lord puts it in his way.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   This is the thing people stumble at.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   "Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it bringeth forth no fruit."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   God seems to be doing the reverse of what we'd expect him,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   but this is God's method always.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You plant, you want fruit, you want wheat, you want corn,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and what you do, well, you take seed, and you sow it into the ground,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and you cover it over with earth, and then you roll the earth.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You do everything you can to hide it and to flatten it, and to stop it coming up.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   But that's the way it comes up.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   That's the kind of principle that we are dealing with here.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   But, of course, this is but a picture.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   It's there in the story of the deliverance of the children of Israel.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   But that's but a pale adumbration of what has happened
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   in the case of the actual great deliverance,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   which God has brought to pass in the being of his only begotten Son,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Now, this is why people reject it.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's so different from what they'd expect in every single respect.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   What would men expect?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Well, men would expect the Savior to be some great personage.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   We are all interested in great men.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Here are worshippers.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   We'd have expected him to be some great king, born in a great palace,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   surrounded with great pomp and circumstance and ceremony.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That's what we'd expect.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Or, at the end of it, we'd expect him to be a great soldier,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   mighty military men, some super, super Alexander the Great,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   or somebody like that, some kind of colossus,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   standing astride across the universe.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Or, we'd have expected him to be a great philosopher.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   We'd never expect a Savior to come out of a little country like Palestine,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   from a little people like the Jews.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   No, no, the thing seems all wrong.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   That's what men look for and expect.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   He wants a great delivering word.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   He wants some great exposition of truth, some philosophical demonstration.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   This is what man is always looking for.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And that's why he rejects the gospel.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   The gospel is always the exact opposite.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   God is always making foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It's the very essence of this gospel.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And if you don't understand this, you've missed the essential principle of the gospel.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And what am I talking about?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Well, what I'm talking about is this.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   When the Deliverer came, he didn't come into a palace.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   He didn't come in any of the guises in which men would expect to see him.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He was born as a helpless babe.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   He was born of a virgin, of a girl nobody had ever heard of,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   most lowly person, very poor person.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   He hadn't a human father.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   There was a mystery about his very birth.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   But I'm emphasizing the lowliness.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   He was born in a stable.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Can't imagine anything lower, can you?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   No pomp and ceremony. Born in a stable.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Body laid in a manger.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And then how did he spend his life?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Well, he worked as a carpenter.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He was an artisan.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   He didn't spend his time learning in the great schools.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He wasn't a regular attender at the academies and the potties of Greece.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Not at all.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Carpenter, working with his hands, living amongst poor people.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   That's the story.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And then he sets out in his ministry and still, you see,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   he does everything that people couldn't understand.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   He's always reversing.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   He makes great claims. He begins to preach.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And yet they say, "How is this man learning, never having learned?"
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And yet the people were conscious of an authority.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The common people recognized it and they said,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "This man speaketh with authority and not as the Pharisees and scribes."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   He wasn't merely displaying learning and comparing and contrasting this view with that
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and quoting the authorities.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   He came directly. He said, "I say unto you."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And they felt the authority.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   But then, you see, the authorities and even his own mother, we are told,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   and especially his own brothers, they couldn't understand him.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   They said, "Now, look here. If you are a king, why don't you say so?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Why don't you declare yourself? Why don't you go up to Jerusalem?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   You say you're a king. Why not go up then and establish yourself,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   take your throne at Jerusalem, gather an army, show that you're a king,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   deliver us from this Roman yoke?"
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Set out, but he didn't do that.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   He'd spend his time up in Galilee and preaching to poor people.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Not addressing the great people, but the poor people.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And he seems proud of that fact, that the poor have the gospel preached unto them.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   "Oh, I mustn't keep you. Read the story in the gospels."
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And what you'll find all along the line is the exact opposite of what the world expects
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   and what the world thinks that God will do if he's got a way of salvation.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   But this is what you find. Here he is, as I'm describing him.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And the story ends with intense suffering, abuse, persecution, sarcasm, scorn.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   They heaped it all upon him.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   They derided him. They spat on him.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And eventually they arrested him. They tried him.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And they condemned him to death.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   This is what they did to him.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   As Paul puts it there in writing to those Corinthians,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   "The princes of this world did not know him,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   for had they known him they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And having condemned him, they took him and they nailed him to a tree.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And there he dies on a tree in apparent complete weakness.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And yet this is the Savior.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   This is the Deliverer.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   This is the Emancipator.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   This is the one that the Hebrew bards and seers have been singing about
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and anticipating, the mighty Deliverer,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   dying in utter and in abject weakness.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And the picture you're given is of the triumph of his enemies all along the line.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   As Pharaoh and the Egyptians are tyrannizing all of these children of Israel
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and everything is going against them until they're at the point of extermination.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So the devil and his hosts and the world are all against the Christ of God.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And he's dead, he's buried, he's laid in a grave, the stone is rolled onto it.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   The enemy is triumphed.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   God is defeated.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   But of course, we know perfectly well that that isn't true.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   We wouldn't be here tonight if that was true.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   This is God's indirect method.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   This is God confounding the wisdom of the wise.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   We know that all that is but the prelude to the victory and the triumph of the glory of the resurrection.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Oh, here it is, you see, in embryo, in this old story about the children of Israel,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   seen to perfection in the story of the Son of God in the New Testament Gospels.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But what is so fascinating and interesting is that God has continued to do things in exactly the same way.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Can you imagine anything quite so ridiculous and monstrous
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   as that the Son of God should leave his cause and his message and his kingdom
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   when he left this world,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   in the hands of the twelve men whom he chose, the disciples?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Who are they? Fishermen, ordinary men.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   You remember that this same council, this Sanhedrin,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   as we've already found in the fourth chapter when they arrested Peter and John,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   we read when they saw the boldness of Peter and John
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Now this is it.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   The Son of God leaves his message, his kingdom, his everything,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   in the hands of ignorant and unlearned men.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   But the thing is quite ridiculous.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   You don't leave a message in the hands of people like that.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   You don't leave a kingdom in the hands of people like that.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   They've got no names, they've got no learning, they've got no authority,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   they've got no money, they've got no armies, they've got nothing.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Yet he leaves it in their hands.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   The thing is mad, but this is God's method.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Paul refers to the foolishness of preaching.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   When the world by wisdom believed not God,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   which some say should be translated by the foolishness of the thing preached.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   It means birth, to save them that believe.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   This is God's way. He ridicules the world.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   You see, all your Greek philosophy can't solve the problem.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   These men can solve it. These have got an answer.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   These are men who can show the power of God working in human lives,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   delivering men from vice and evil and sin,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   renovating them, giving them new hearts, new understandings,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   making new men of them.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   What the Greeks have failed to do, Christianity has done and is still doing.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   God is making foolish the wisdom of this world.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   So he takes the ignorant, he takes the foolish, he takes the weak,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   and he allows them to suffer persecutions and trials.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   You read in this book of Acts how the enemies of the gospel
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   did exactly the same to the early church
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   as Pharaoh and his people had done to the children of Israel
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   in the captivity and the bondage of Egypt.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   They repeated it all, and God apparently is allowing them to be exterminated,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   but always at the right moment the deliverance comes.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Now this is, you see, a kind of epitome of the whole of the gospel.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Or let me sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   God moves in a mysterious way.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   His wonders to perform.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   He plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   If you don't start with this element of mystery and amazement and astonishment,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   you'll never believe this gospel.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Don't judge the Lord by feeble sense.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Recognize your own finiteness, your own sinfulness,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   your own total inability to understand the mind of the eternal God.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Now there's the first principle which we find, but let me hurry to a second.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And here I want to show you now not so much the surprising character
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and the mystery of God's ways, but the wisdom of God's ways.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   The wisdom of God's method, this indirect method.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   This employment of Pharaoh, this employment of the Egyptians,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   this allowing of his people to suffer.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Can I defend this? Can I show the wisdom of this?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Can I show the reason of this? Why does God do this?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Can I indulge in an attempt at some kind of theodicy?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Not that God needs my defense or the defense of anybody else,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   but let me show to you how the wisdom of God is manifest in this extraordinary way of his.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Now here again, the humanist, the natural man with his human wisdom
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   shows his unutterable blindness.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Why does God behave like this?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   The simple answer is, this is the only way whereby men can be saved.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   The only way.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Now I want to substantiate that.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Take it first of all in the setting here of the children of Israel
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   in the bondage and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   How can these people be delivered?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   They're God's people.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   He has promised to their father Abraham that the land of Canaan shall be theirs forever.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   But they're in Egypt.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Now the great question is, how can these people be brought back to their own land?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   This is a tremendous problem.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Let me show you there are two main elements in the problem.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   The first is this, that the children of Israel themselves didn't want to go back to Canaan.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   You remember how at the time of Joseph they'd all gone down to Egypt
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and because Joseph had become such a great man in Egypt,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   they were given the best land and they prospered.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   They did amazingly well.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   They became wealthy and if it had been left to them,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   they'd have spent the rest of their history down in the land of Egypt,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   making money, prospering, having a good time,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   everything going well, settling down in Egypt to enjoy Egypt.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   That was the first problem.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   They're God's people, but they've forgotten that.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Prosperity makes them forget that.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   There they are, they're quite happy, they're quite content,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   they'll go on living there forever and forever.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Here there's the first problem.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   The second is, of course, the might and the power of Pharaoh.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   How can that problem be dealt with?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   How can these people be brought back to their own land of Canaan,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   the land that they are to possess, according to the promise of God to Abraham?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Now, you try and solve that problem,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   you clever people who are ready to give advice to statesmen
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and who think that a preacher's business is to tell statesmen what to do.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   You tell me, how are problems to be solved?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And I'm here to tell you that there's only one way whereby that problem can be solved.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   God has got to do something to these people first.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   He's got to make the circumstances of those people so unhappy
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   that they'll want to go from there.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   If God had allowed things to remain as they were,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   the children of Israel would never have lifted a finger.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   They'd have never started a rebellion or anything else.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   So God deliberately changes their circumstances
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   in order to make them desire to get out of Egypt.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   This is a parable, isn't it?
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   That's the trouble with all of us in this world.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   We want to settle down and have our proverbial good time,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and you know it takes God to disturb us and to smash us up at times to get us out of it.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   He has to bring these people out,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   so he first has to reduce their circumstances to this condition
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   in which they're terrified, horrified, want to get out,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and are crying to be let out.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And at the same time he has to do something to Pharaoh.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   He would like to have kept them as slaves.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   They were very useful to him.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   He's now turned against them.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   He's taken their prosperity from them,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   and he's turned them into slaves.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And it would have suited his book very well
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   to continue using these strangers who'd come to their country as their slaves.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   So God has to deal with Pharaoh also.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And he has to turn him against them, and then he does things to him
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   so that he at last wants to get rid of them.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And that is how the children of Israel escaped from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   God changed them, and he changed Pharaoh,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   so that in the end they wanted to go and Pharaoh wanted them to go.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And there you see this amazing wisdom of God.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   But this is only an Old Testament picture.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   This is a kind of prototype.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   This is a kind of type of the great prototype that was later to come.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Look at all this in a few hurried words as you see it in the New Testament gospel.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   How is a man saved?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   How is any one of us going to be delivered from the thralldom of the world and the flesh and the devil?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   How can any one of us be restored to communion and fellowship with God
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and the enjoyment of the blessings of the Christian gospel?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   I'll tell you.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   The first thing that has to happen to us is that the law comes upon us.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   God has acted like this.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   This is a kind of hurried view of history.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   What's the meaning of the whole of the Old Testament?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Well, it is God showing the world that it can't save itself.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   God allowed all those years to pass, all those centuries to pass,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   in order that the Greeks might have a chance and the Assyrians and the Chaldeans and the Romans.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   They've all had all full opportunity.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   They can't do it.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   God gives them time.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Seems very indirect, seems to have forgotten his plan.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   No, he hasn't.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He's just giving them time to show their own, to see their own failure.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Then he gives the law to the children of Israel.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Why does he do this?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Well, he gives them the law in order to show them the impossibility of the task that was confronting them.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   A man thinks, as long as I live a good life and live my 20 shillings in the pound in a moral sense, I'm all right.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But you're not.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   The law of God demands this.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   That's the first commandment.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   The second is likened to it.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And God gives us that law.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   What for? To knock us down?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   To show us the utter impossibility.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   What's the use of cleverness, humanism, science, anything you like, when that's the task?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   It can't be done.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   It's an utter impossibility.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   And then he presses the law upon us still more and shows us our failure, our sins, our shortcomings, our miserable condition,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   and our utter inability ever to please him.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   We are under the wrath of God.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   The law.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   But it's God who gives the law.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Why does he give us the law?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   He gives us the law to make us miserable.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Why are people not Christian?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Because they don't know their need of Christ.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   They've never known the conviction of the law.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Like the children of Israel.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   You settle down in this world eating, drinking, dancing, indulging, sex.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Ah, isn't life wonderful?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And people don't turn to God until they have to.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Like those foolish people crossing the Atlantic on the first voyage of the Titanic on that Sunday afternoon
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   with a jazz band playing and everybody dancing and drinking.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Then the horrible thud of striking an iceberg and the band automatically turns to playing
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   "Nearer, my God, to thee, miserable cowards and cads."
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   But we only turn to him when we've been forced to do so by circumstances or by the terrors of the law,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   by conviction of sin, by an accusing conscience, by the fear of death and the grave.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   These are the things that God sends to disturb us and to convict us and to cast us down
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   and to show us our terrible need in the bondage and the captivity of sin and Satan.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   We don't like the law, do we?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   We hate it in fact.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And we hate God and his justice.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I know we do.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   If it were not for those, you see, we'd go to damnation.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   It is only a man who knows something about the holiness of God and the vileness of his own heart
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   who'll ever know the salvation that is in Christ.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And then God provides the perfect salvation that we need.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   It is all in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Why did he come as he did?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Well, he came like that because he had to be a human representative.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   He's got to be a man amongst men.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Though he is the eternal son of God, he's born of a woman, born made under the law.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   He's got to.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   He's come to redeem us who are under the law, so he's got to come under the law.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   If he wasn't a man, we'd say it isn't fair, but he is a man.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   He stooped so low so that he can save the lowest.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   He tops the depths in order that he can raise us up to the heights.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Not only is he born like that, but he was subject to testing.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   He was subject to temptations, tempted in all points, like as we are.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   You see, that's the final condemnation of your great humanist philosophers.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   It's a very select body that they appeal to, isn't it?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   What have they got to say to Tom, Dick, and Harry?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   He doesn't understand their philosophy.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   He hears them talking cleverly on the television or somewhere else.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   He says, "I don't know what they're talking about."
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He switches them off.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   He turns to drink or to something primitive.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I can understand him.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   There's no salvation there.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   But here is one who's come so lowly, poor, ignorant in a sense as a man,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   an artisan, a carpenter, and yet God, and filled with all understanding.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   But what about the cross, you say?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Isn't that failure?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Isn't that the triumph of his enemies?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   My dear friend, if you think that, you know, you're just displaying your ignorance
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   and the smallness of your outlook.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Peter, the apostle Peter, dealt with that once and forever in his sermon
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   He put it in these words, "Him, Christ, being delivered by the determinate counsel
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   They thought they'd got him, that they'd beaten him.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   They didn't know.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   They were but the instruments that God was using.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Do you know, my friend, God used wicked men to kill his own son.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   That's what he did.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   As he used Pharaoh and the Egyptians to deal with the children of Israel
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   in this harsh and hard manner, God used Pontius Pilate and Herod and all the rest of them
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   to kill, to crucify his own son.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   That is God's action.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Why did he do it?
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   It is the only way whereby anybody can be forgiven.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   This is the wisdom of God.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Christ, crucified, is not only the power of God, he is the wisdom of God.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Here is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   God sent his Son into the world to bear our sins, to bear the punishment of our sins,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   to bear the guilt of our sins.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   It is God who smote him on Calvary's cross.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   It is by his stripes we are healed.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   He's used men, evil men, to bring his own glorious purposes to pass.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   There was none other good enough to pay the price of sin.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   He only could unlock the gates of heaven and let us in.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   This, I say, is this amazing display of the wisdom of God.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   He has to deal with us.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   He has to deal with our enemies.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   He does it all in one action, in one person, Jesus Christ and him crucified, the wisdom of God.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   But let me just give you some headings under my last general principle,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   which is the explanation for the vindication of these God's ways.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Here it is.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Why does God behave like this?
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Why does God act in this manner?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   It is because of his eternal heart of love.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   God does all these things in order to bless and to deliver his people.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Why did he raise a pharaoh and the Egyptians to maltreat his people?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   In order to get his people out of a life of ease and of affluence and of moral, spiritual death,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and get them back to their own land of possession.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It was his love for them that made him do what he did.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   He wanted them back in kin, and he got them back in kin.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Oh, this is a wonderful gospel, this.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   All things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   All things.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   You mustn't merely look at the temporary, you must look at the end, you must look at the object.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Do you know, my friend, if God has set his heart upon you, he's going to bring you to salvation.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   If you are foolish enough and stupid enough to resist his will, he'll bring you down.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   He may take your health from you, he may put you on your back,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   he may rob you of your wife or of your children, he may rob you of your purse,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   he may make you lose your money.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   God wants you, he'll separate you from everything that is enslaving you and keeping you from him.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It's his love that drives him to do so.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   His love.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he calleth."
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   You know, the people I'm really alarmed about and sorry for are the people in whose lives nothing ever goes wrong.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   That's a terrible thing.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Oh, as I look back across my little life, I thank God more than anything else for the way in which he's frustrated my plans and purposes.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Oh, love that will not let me go!
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   The hound of heaven that would not let me go, that brings me into difficulties, makes me unhappy,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   knocks me down, destroys my guards, makes me cry in agony.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Thank God he's done it all. He's done it for my good.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   That's the first reason, I hope.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   The second is that he's concerned about the destruction of his enemies and my enemies.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   How clear that is in the case of Egypt.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Follow the story right through and you'll see it ended in the destruction of Pharaoh and his hosts,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   and all his chariots and horses and all the rest of it.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Oh, that's God's way.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   That when Christ was dying upon the cross, the enemy was triumphant.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   He thought he'd achieved everything that he desired.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   He'd got rid of the Christ of God.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Oh, the blindness and oh, the tragic blindness of the enemies of God.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Listen, this is what was happening on the cross.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   "You being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   triumphing over them in it."
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   The cross is not the failure of God and his Son, it is the triumph.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   It is the defeat and the failure of the enemy, Satan bound and banished sin.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   That's the second explanation, but here's the third and the last.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   God does these things and he does them in his own way, because of his own glory.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   How often did he tell the children of Israel,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   "Not for your sake, but for my own name's sake, I am doing this and that."
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   You see, my friends, you and I need to be humbled.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   No man has ever become a Christian without being humbled.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Any man who thinks he can stand on his feet and face life and deliver his opinions,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   is a man who's lost.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Before you're saved, you're humbled, you're smitten to the ground,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   and from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   But there's a lot of heartache before it comes to that, isn't there?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Everything seems to be going wrong.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   All the pain that that hymn speaks of, it's all so true of us,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and it is an essential principle, I say, of this great salvation.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   "Oh joy that seekest me through pain, I cannot close my heart to thee.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I trace the rainbow through the rain and feel the promise is not vain,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   that morn shall tearless be. Oh cross, cross that liftest up my head,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   I dare not ask to fly from thee, I dare not.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I lay in dust, life's glory dead.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And then, and then only, from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be."
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   God has to humble us and bring us to the very dust.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Why? Well to bring us to see that we are totally dependent upon him,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   that we can do nothing apart from him, that we must trust his Son,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   our blessed Lord and Savior, that there's no other hope.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Paul gives the answer. Why does God do all this?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   That no flesh should glory in his presence.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Nobody could explain the exodus and the deliverance of the children of Israel in human terms.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   God must have the glory. And so Paul ends by saying, "Him that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   My dear friend, I leave you with a question. Have you seen all this?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Have you seen it in the lesson, the story of the children of Israel in Egypt?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Have you seen it in the whole story of the coming and the dying and the rising of the Son of God?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Have you seen that God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform?
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Here it is deep in unfathomable minds of never failing skill.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   He treasures up his bright designs and works his sovereign will.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, but trust him for his grace.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Behind a frowning providence such as it was in Egypt, he hides a smiling on a father's face.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   His purposes will ripen fast, unfolding every hour.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   The bud may have a bitter taste, and it was very bitter for the poor children of Israel.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's bitter for a man under the condemnation of the law, a man under conviction of sin.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   It's bitter. It's agonizing.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   The bud may have a bitter taste, but sweet shall be the flower.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Blind in belief is sure to err, and scan his work in vain.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   God is his own interpreter, and he will make it plain.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   I simply ask you, have you come to see that?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Have you seen the folly of trying to understand the mind and the wisdom of God?
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Fall at his feet. Acknowledge your unbelief, this blind unbelief,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   which is ever so sure and certain to scan his work in vain.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   But rather join with Isaac Watts in saying,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   "Almighty God to thee be endless honor done, the undivided free and the mysterious one,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   where reason fails with all her powers, there faith prevails and love adores."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Have you seen the marvel, the mystery, and the wonder of God's ways?
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   And have you come to the point that far from resenting it and rejecting it,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   you humble yourself gladly to it and glory in it?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Glory in the Lord.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   Learn the lesson of the folly of the wisdom of the members of the Sanhedrin,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   the folly of all who reject this miraculous supernatural manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Become as a little child, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   be saved, and enter into the everlasting kingdom of glory and of God. Amen.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Let us sing that great hymn of Isaac Watts, hymn number 220.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   We give immortal praise to God the Father's love.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Hymn number 220.
