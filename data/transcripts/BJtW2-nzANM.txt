[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   We make these devices called microfluidic devices that are kind of like, you know, you
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.040]   can sort of picture the way integrated circuits made it possible to do a lot of electronic
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.400]   computations and have very small footprint.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.540]   And that kind of led to this revolution in computer science hardware.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.240]   For us, what we do is we use these, we make these microfluidic devices that allow us to
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.400]   do like fluidic computations in high throughput in very small footprints.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.160]   So now what we can do is we can do...
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   Fluidic computation.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   Right.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.920]   So, you know, normally if you were going to do an experiment in biology, you sort of picture
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.840]   like test tubes and like Petri dishes and like big things.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.400]   And if you wanted to do a thousand reactions, you need these giant expensive robots.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.080]   And so what we've been doing is we've been using this approach where we can create these
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.320]   like tiny devices that instead of using like five milliliters of fluid for each reaction,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.800]   we use about a nanoliter.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520]   And these devices make it possible to use, you know, fewer reagents.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.480]   So everything is low cost.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.080]   We can automate things on these devices without the use of expensive robots.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.640]   And now, you know, the main power of these technologies is that they allow us to make
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   a thousand measurements in the amount of time and cost that it used to take to make one
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.920]   in biology.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.600]   And now I think that that means that we can generate data at a scale that allows us to
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.720]   quantitatively test predictions from our colleagues in ML.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   Right.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   So, you know, you all need ground truth.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.440]   You need some ground truth measurement to assess what's going on.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.920]   And you can't just have one or two.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.340]   You need enough that you can do some sort of regression to figure out where is your
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.880]   model successful and where is it failing?
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.240]   And so, you know, our job is to make measurements of like a thousand things really quantitatively
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.400]   where we can interface back and forth with ML people to test those predictions, revise
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.960]   and refine those models, and, you know, hopefully try and use some of these ML predictions to
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.080]   learn new physics.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.880]   That's what we want to do.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   That's so cool.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.840]   So what would be something that would happen at that tiny scale?
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.920]   Are you literally putting a protein in there and watching what happens?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.280]   Can you explain exactly what goes into that?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   So, okay, here's two examples of some platforms we've developed.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.560]   So we've been working really closely with Dan Herschlag and he's like an enzymologist.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.800]   And so one type of protein that we're interested in is enzymes and enzymes are like they underpin
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.480]   all of our metabolism, right?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   They make it possible to do chemical reactions that would never happen in the absence of
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   an enzyme.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   So they're really, they're important, but for our cells, they're the tools people use
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.680]   in modern molecular biology.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.840]   You use them to make libraries for sequencing.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.480]   People use them and, you know, you use them when you do your laundry, right?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.120]   Enzymes are the things that like bust up stains on your clothes.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040]   And we still don't really know how the sequence of an enzyme specifies its function.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.520]   So one thing that we can do now is just like sort of a, I guess, you know, DNA, like the
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.860]   Moderna vaccine, right?
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.900]   Everybody's sort of heard now we can make this mRNA vaccine and we can program it to
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.760]   make something that we want.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.080]   We can create little pieces of DNA, each of which specifies a protein we want to make.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.480]   We can use a robot so that we spot bits of this DNA in an array.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.520]   So we have like a thousand little spots and we know the program encoded by the DNA in
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   each spot.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.000]   We can take one of these devices that we make that has little chambers and align them to
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.940]   the spots.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.600]   And then there's sort of this magical mixture of like all of the stuff that you need to
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.520]   turn DNA into RNA and protein.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.440]   The companies sell, it's like you just buy this little tube that has, you know, the polymerase
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.560]   you learned about in high school biology, the ribosome that makes the protein, all that
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   stuff.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   We push it into these little chambers.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   And that fits in a nanoliter?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.120]   So the nanoliter is not, it all fits?
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.040]   Nanoliter, a nanoliter is like, okay, your hair, a hair strand is like a hundred microns.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.680]   Each of the chambers in these devices is about the diameter of your hair and the height of
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.600]   a 10th of your hair.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.920]   So we use a lot of the machinery that people use for lithography to make these integrated
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   circuits.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   We use all the same equipment to make these tiny devices.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.000]   And now we can make a little bit-
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.680]   I can see the integrated circuit analogy.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.880]   So we do, we really do use a lot of the same equipment, except for now, instead of pushing
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.560]   electrons around, we're actually pushing fluid that contains molecules in different ways
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.020]   within these devices.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.000]   So we can make each one of these enzyme variants in each chamber.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.300]   And now we can quantitatively ask, when you make this mutation, how does it affect the
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.040]   ability of this enzyme to catalyze the reaction it's supposed to catalyze?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.640]   So that's an example of one of the things that we do.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.760]   And the reason why you would want to do it is this might help us classify variants in
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.960]   the human population for whether or not they're likely to compromise function and cause disease.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   It could also maybe help us generate new enzymes that eat up environmental waste or design
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.880]   new enzymes to do things that we want to do.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.640]   One other example, I guess, of something that we do is historically, when you've looked
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.400]   at a population of cells, let's say from a tumor, we've ground up all those cells and
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.800]   we've asked, what's the behavior of that population of cells?
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.920]   Within all of those cells, maybe there's one or two rare cells that's resistant to a drug.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.440]   And when we treat a patient with that drug, those one or two cells are going to proliferate
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.640]   and drive treatment failures.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.560]   So we need a way where instead of looking at all of the cells mashed up together, we
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.660]   want to be able to profile the cells one by one.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:50.720]   So another technology that we're using that this field, microfluidics, allows you to do
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.680]   is we can actually put every cell in a tiny droplet, like a little, basically a little
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.800]   water and oil droplet that serves as a tiny compartment where we can interrogate that
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.120]   cell by itself without looking at all of its neighbors at the same time.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   And so again, those are little, those droplets are like a nanoliter, right?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.200]   And we can look at a million cells individually at once in their own little nanoliter compartments.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.240]   Thanks for watching this clip.
