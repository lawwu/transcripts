[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   We get a steady stream of really tough pastoral questions
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.480]   for Pastor John in our inbox.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.700]   Thank you for sending them into us
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.960]   and thank you for your patience
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.320]   as we try to work through as many of them as possible.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.640]   Here's one of those questions.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.880]   It's from a listener named Eric, who's a pastor.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.800]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600]   I'm a pastor wondering what should be
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   a corrective course of action
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.280]   when a Christian knowingly marries an unbeliever?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.680]   The believer was forewarned
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.360]   and went ahead with the union anyway.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.320]   Now the marriage has been formalized.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.920]   How should we, the church, now respond?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.280]   To answer this, let's clarify
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.280]   how many layers of sinfulness there are
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.240]   when a professing believer
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.800]   rejects the counsel of the church elders
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.780]   and marries an unbeliever.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.240]   I'll just mention three layers.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.400]   There are others,
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.320]   but this will help us feel the seriousness of it.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.320]   First, the professing believer
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.240]   is defying and rebelling against
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.480]   an explicit command of the New Testament, of God.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.000]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7:39,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.420]   a wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives,
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420]   but if her husband dies, she's free to be married
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   to whomever she wishes, only in the Lord.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.280]   Only in the Lord means only to a person
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   who is in the Lord, a believer, a follower of Jesus.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.480]   So if this teaching is made clear to the believer
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   and the believer rejects obedience to this command,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   she or he is acting in open defiance
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.440]   of the teaching of the apostles and of God.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.880]   Second, probably even more important,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.280]   because it gets to the heart of the matter,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520]   a believer who chooses to marry an unbeliever
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.120]   shows how deeply compromised
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.660]   the believer's love for Christ is.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.520]   Jesus said, "Unless you love me
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.300]   "more than you love your closest human loved one,
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800]   "you're not worthy of me," Matthew 10:37.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.920]   That's an amazing claim that Jesus lays on our hearts.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   But if the believer enjoys the presence
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.840]   and the friendship and the intimacy
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.280]   of a Christ-rejecting person, boyfriend, girlfriend,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.100]   more than the presence and the fellowship of Christ,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   their very faith and love for Jesus is in question.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.740]   By Jesus, not me, by Jesus, that's the deepest issue.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.740]   How can the heart of a believer embrace Jesus
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.180]   as its supreme treasure and satisfaction
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.940]   and reject the words of Jesus
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.940]   in order to be in the arms of one who has no faith
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.100]   and no true affection
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.940]   for the believer's most treasured possession?
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.280]   Inconceivable to me.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.780]   I've always found that incomprehensible.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.000]   Something is deeply, deeply wrong
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.540]   with the heart's affection for Christ.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.980]   It's the second layer of sinfulness.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.060]   And the third, if faithful leaders in the church
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.880]   have lovingly explained God's will
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.400]   based on God's word to the believer
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   and have told the believer not to move forward
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   with this illicit marriage out of obedience to Christ,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.600]   then the marriage is not only rebellion
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.360]   against the explicit biblical command
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.160]   and not only a revelation of an idolatrous heart
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.440]   that puts a human above Christ in the affections,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.480]   but also a spurning of the authority of the elders,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.720]   which God gave to protect the sheep from sin.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.400]   Now that's the situation, and I start there
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.300]   so that the rest of what I have to say
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.720]   will sound appropriately serious.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   My answer is that the elders plead, they pray, they teach,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.760]   then if all of that is rejected,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   you remove the believer from membership in the church
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.520]   for moving ahead with the marriage.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.520]   The aim of this removal is to sober the disobedient believer,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.720]   wake them up, and win them to a repentant
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   and obedient heart and restoration.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.580]   Many people do not take the Bible seriously.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   They are baffled and angry by churches
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.620]   who take the Bible as seriously as I'm saying.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.600]   Many professing Christians today
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.020]   would regard such excommunication
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.160]   as more hurtful than helpful.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.040]   They'd call it intolerant.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.980]   They'd even call it hateful.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.940]   But that's because they elevate their own wisdom
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.520]   above God's wisdom.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   They use the same reasoning
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.480]   for why we should not remove a person from membership
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.000]   that the disobedient person used to marry the unbeliever
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.800]   in the first place, namely,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.400]   well, maybe the unbeliever will be one to Christ
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   in this marriage.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.660]   Maybe if you keep them as members
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.960]   or keep one of them as members, the other will be one.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.760]   And the parents, oh my, of the excommunicated person
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.080]   or friends, if they're not seriously biblical,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.320]   will argue that you won't be able to win them to Christ
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.560]   by putting them out of the church.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.680]   They're gonna get angry.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.880]   The unbeliever will call you intolerant and hateful.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.460]   It won't be redemptive.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.500]   It will be alienating.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.680]   That's what they're gonna say.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.760]   That's what elders have to be prepared to hear.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.120]   That's emphatically not what the Bible teaches.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.180]   In 2 Thessalonians 3, 14 and 15,
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.160]   and in 1 Corinthians 5, 4 and 5,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.280]   Paul holds out the possibility and the desire
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   that by means of such holy ostracism,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760]   people will in fact be saved and restored.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   In fact, I have seen church discipline
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.320]   have that very effect in my ministry.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   Church leaders have to be prepared to be vilified
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.360]   by people who think they know better
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.420]   than the apostles how to love people.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.840]   One other question to answer is this
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.720]   that's very important.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.920]   What does repentance and restoration look like
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.540]   in such a situation?
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.840]   It does not mean that the marriage is nullified.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.300]   It really is a marriage,
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.560]   a marriage that should not have been entered into,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   but now having been entered into, should not be broken.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.040]   It should be sanctified.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.880]   And Paul is just as clear about the fact
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.980]   that a believer should not divorce an unbeliever.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.840]   1 Corinthians 7, 12, as he is that they shouldn't marry one.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   So repentance of sin in marrying an unbeliever
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.320]   does not include divorcing the unbeliever.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   What it includes is a heart change, not a marriage change.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.720]   There should be an authentic remorse and regret
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.320]   for disobedience to 1 Corinthians 7, 39.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.980]   There should be an acknowledgement and repentance
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.240]   that the heart was not right
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.460]   in putting man above Christ in the affections.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.620]   There should be an apology and sorrow
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.780]   for spurning the counsel of God's leaders in the church.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.860]   And all of these changes are possible
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.480]   while the marriage stays intact.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   Indeed, I would say, and maybe the last thing I would say,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   is that a man or a woman who stays in such a marriage
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:30.260]   can say to an unbelieving spouse these words,
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.940]   my reawakened love for Jesus
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:39.900]   and my treasuring Christ above you as my Lord and Savior,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.820]   and my desire to be a part of Christ's people again,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.620]   and my regret over my sin in marrying an unbeliever
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.420]   does not mean I stop loving you
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.560]   or that I want to leave you.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.760]   We have a covenant till death do us part.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.300]   I intend to keep it.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.120]   In fact, my restored faith
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   means that I now know how to love you better.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.300]   I would like to show it.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.620]   I hope you will have me.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.360]   Whether the unbelieving spouse will receive that,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.020]   we don't know, but it is possible.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.700]   And that's the goal of the discipline.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.420]   That's our prayer.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.380]   - Thank you for walking us through
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.260]   this pastorally sensitive scenario, Pastor John.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.820]   And thank you for listening.

[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.540]   We're gonna stay on this theme of non-Christians,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.580]   because next time we have two questions in the inbox
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.420]   about what happens to non-Christians
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.740]   who participate in the Lord's Supper.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.640]   A great question.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.020]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.700]   We will see you on Monday for that
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.220]   with Pastor John in studio.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.180]   We'll see you then.
