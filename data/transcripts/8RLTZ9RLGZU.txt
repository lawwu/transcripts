[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.340]   In the last episode, you talked to writers,
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.560]   and I want you to talk to writers one more time.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.800]   Talk to those of us who write
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.400]   or who aspire to serve the church as writers.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.700]   Talk to us about calling.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.660]   Most Christian writers, it seems,
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.380]   write to self-express,
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.180]   not from a conscious conviction
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.660]   that God has called them to write,
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900]   and certainly not in a formal sense of calling
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.940]   to ministry like a pastor maybe has.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.140]   So speak to writers.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.120]   How would I know if God is calling me to this work?
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.580]   God's calling in the New Testament
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.020]   is mainly our calling out of darkness into light.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.460]   You know that, everybody, I suppose.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.580]   Well, lots of people know that.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.620]   Our calling in conversion.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.580]   So when we speak calling,
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.620]   that's the way the New Testament mainly talks about it.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.100]   But it can also refer to our life work,
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100]   like 1 Corinthians 7:15.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100]   When it does, it may mean the place God has put us
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.140]   whether we like it or not.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.820]   In other words, it's not driven by our desires like slavery.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700]   Paul deals with that in 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.900]   If you're stuck in the horrible position of slavery,
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.940]   that's your calling in the moment,
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.260]   whether you want it or not.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.740]   It may also mean what you're able to choose,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.820]   like freedom from slavery,
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.460]   which he also addresses in 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.700]   So in that latter case,
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.540]   when we have some freedom to choose our life work,
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.900]   which most people in the world, by the way, do not have,
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.300]   and they still have a calling.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.540]   I want to make sure I say that
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.600]   because I think sometimes we Westerners
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.860]   who have so much incredible options,
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.460]   like we're 15, we're dreaming about 10 things
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.740]   we might be when we grow up.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100]   Most people in the world do not have that kind of freedom,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.500]   but they have a calling.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.180]   Wherever they are, they can have a calling.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.280]   However, I'm addressing us who have some measure of freedom
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.580]   in which we can discern among possibilities
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.260]   of things to do.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.100]   And so my understanding of this kind of calling
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   is that it's a work of God in our minds and hearts
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.180]   and abilities and relationships
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.180]   that results in a recurrent, not temporary,
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.980]   long-term, not short-lived,
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.160]   compelling, not merely interesting,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.900]   benevolent, not selfish, Christ-exalting,
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.820]   not self-exalting, desire to write,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.140]   which proves fruitful in the lives of others.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.780]   Now, that's a long...
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.260]   That's my definition of a calling to write.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.100]   I'll say it again.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.420]   It is a recurrent, not temporary, long-term,
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.760]   not short-lived, compelling, not merely interesting,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.940]   benevolent, not selfish, Christ-exalting,
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.060]   not self-exalting, desire to write,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860]   which proves fruitful in the lives of others.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.580]   So let me illustrate the emergence of this calling
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.460]   through levels of impulse to write
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.860]   that many of us pass through.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.540]   It is good to write for the sake of discovery.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.380]   We learn as we write, and we write as we learn.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.260]   This is good.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.020]   It is one of the main reasons for keeping a journal,
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.420]   say, when you're younger or older,
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.580]   an idea notebook where you can work out your ideas
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.500]   and your thoughts.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   This impulse, however, is not yet God's calling to write.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.140]   If that impulse is on you, you don't know yet
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.380]   whether you have a divine calling to be a writer.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.180]   Second, it is good to write
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.900]   for the sake of craftsmanship or beauty.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.060]   Human beings love to create things.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.500]   Some create delicious meals, beautifully served.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.260]   Some create homes of beauty
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.300]   with everything decorated in a pleasing way,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.700]   and some create machines that accomplish amazing things.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.060]   Some create lesson plans for teaching.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.180]   Some create paintings, carvings, songs,
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.420]   patios, porches, decks, and on and on and on.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.860]   We are makers by nature.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.140]   It is properly satisfying to create things,
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.140]   and many people aim to make something beautiful by writing,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.700]   something interesting, something compelling, and that's good,
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   and that is not yet a divine calling to write.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.820]   Just to have that impulse is not a calling.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.420]   Then there is the impulse to write,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.420]   not only to learn and not only to create something beautiful
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.060]   or interesting or compelling,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   but also the impulse to instruct and awaken and delight
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.380]   and transform people into obedient worshipers of Christ.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.860]   When this impulse takes hold of a person,
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   they are experiencing a call from God to write.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.380]   Then the impulse to write, to discover and learn
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.860]   is never enough.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.920]   It's good, it's real, but it won't satisfy.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.100]   The impulse to make something beautiful and interesting
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.500]   and compelling is never enough.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.140]   It's real, it's good, but it won't satisfy the person
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.020]   that has a divine calling from God on his life to write.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   A divine calling to write is a calling from God,
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.740]   through God, and for God.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.740]   Until the writing is for God, it's not a calling from God.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.300]   So we move from truth discovery
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.700]   through writing to creative expression
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700]   through writing to the role of a servant in writing,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.080]   which I described earlier like this.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   The impulse to instruct and awaken and delight
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.380]   and transform people into obedient worshipers of Christ.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.860]   Instruct in the infinite expanse of truth.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.460]   Awaken to the glory of God,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.740]   radiant through all that he's made.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.740]   Delight with craftsmanship of poetry and diction
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.740]   and style and story and transform people
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.440]   into those who enjoy God with us
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.620]   and walk in a way that pleases God.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.420]   All of which means that the calling to write
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.820]   is by all means a calling to influence
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.360]   and transform, awaken, instruct, delight.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.300]   And it is a calling, therefore, to pray and trust God
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.380]   because we can't do that by writing.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.220]   Writing must become an instrument in the hand
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.140]   of the Holy Spirit and his miracle working power.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.140]   So the person with a calling from God to be a writer
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.060]   is a person called to do in the lives of others
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.100]   through writing what only God can do.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   - That is very helpful.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.620]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.340]   Well, being a Christian in this world
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.300]   calls for an emotional complexity.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.100]   And that's exactly what John Piper will explain
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.060]   for us tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.200]   Thanks for listening.
