[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.480]   - This week we are honored to have Randy Alcorn with us
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.360]   as a special guest and lined up are several
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.040]   of the most common questions about heaven we have.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.400]   Randy has written a large book on heaven.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.840]   He's an expert in the topic
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.200]   and no, he has not been there and back.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.680]   So let's get this week underway with Randy
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.360]   who joins us over the phone from his home.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   I presume Randy, much of the fully revealed new earth,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.680]   what we often refer to as heaven,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.120]   will be completely unrecognizable to us.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.880]   The new earth will be recreated
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.400]   but there will be some continuity too.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.280]   So how much of it will be familiar to us?
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320]   For example, will the Himalayan mountains remain
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.140]   or will every visible feature
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.400]   of this creation be completely changed?
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.160]   - Well, the short answer would be,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.640]   I think the Himalayan mountains could very easily remain
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.600]   and I would not expect every visible feature
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.640]   of creation to be changed.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.440]   And the reason for that would be
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.840]   that I think our proper understanding
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.080]   of the new earth has to be based on some kind of model.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.320]   And what would that model be?
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.840]   Well, it's the new earth in the same way
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.400]   that in the resurrection, we will have new bodies.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.600]   So resurrected bodies, resurrected earth.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.880]   So what do we know about our bodies?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720]   Well, we know that our bodies,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.400]   Christ's body is the prototype for ours in his resurrection.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   We know that he was recognizable as such.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.960]   His features were the same.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280]   The great majority of times that he,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.800]   in the recorded appearances that he's seen by the disciples,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.960]   they know immediately who he is.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860]   Now, a lot of people focus on the two or three times
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.300]   where he wasn't immediately recognized
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.680]   but there were special conditions in those cases.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   Mary at the tomb, it's dark, it's early in the morning,
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   a modest woman doesn't look into the eyes of a man
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.880]   who she doesn't know or she thinks she doesn't know.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.920]   And that's why she thinks it's the gardener.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.420]   And Jesus, her Lord is dead and she knows that.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.800]   So of all times, you could easily explain
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   her not immediately recognizing him.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   And as soon as he says her name, she recognizes his voice.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.320]   Likewise on the Emmaus road, some people say,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.520]   well, look, they didn't even recognize Jesus.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   So he must not have looked like he did.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.880]   But actually in verse 16 of Luke 24,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.400]   we're told they were kept from recognizing him.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.180]   And as soon as that veil was pulled back,
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.880]   they did recognize him as such.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   The same thing when he's on the shore fixing breakfast,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.420]   the saplings are in the boat, they're a long way away,
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.960]   but then all of a sudden they realized, wait, it's the Lord.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.520]   And it's just, they knew it was the Lord.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.660]   So you got the continuity of the nail prints in his hands.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.980]   You've got a lot of different aspects
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.440]   and theologian Herman Baving said,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.000]   God's honor could consist precisely in the fact
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.360]   that he redeems and renews the same humanity,
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.320]   the same world, the same heaven,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.040]   the same earth that had been corrupted and polluted by sin.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.360]   So in other words, it's the importance of that continuity.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.400]   So I think there's a new Jerusalem.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.580]   Well, there was an old Jerusalem.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.200]   Since there's a new Jerusalem and we're told
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.580]   that people will bring their treasures
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.100]   from all over the earth.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.540]   The kings of the nations of the earth
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.500]   will bring their treasures in the new Jerusalem.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.600]   It says that at the end of Revelation 21.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Well, why would those people not look like
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.460]   the people of those nations?
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.640]   And why would the treasures they bring in,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.420]   perhaps as tribute to the king, not have a continuity
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.880]   to the kinds of handmade cultural treasures
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.040]   that we would have today.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.120]   So I think there's every reason to expect
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.280]   that in the majority of cases,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.480]   that there would be a continuity between old earth,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.160]   new earth, if there's a new Jerusalem,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.440]   why not a new Los Angeles?
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   Why not a new Chicago, a new Paris, a new London?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.200]   - Fascinating.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Grace restores nature as old Herman Baving like to say,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.680]   which seems to have big ramifications for heaven.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.160]   Thank you, Randy, for that.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.000]   And for more on this and so many other topics,

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.760]   Speaking of heaven, a question we get often
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.060]   in the Ask Pastor John mailbag is this,
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.940]   will there be sports in heaven?
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.920]   And we'll ask Randy that tomorrow.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.820]   Thanks for listening to Heaven Week
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.480]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
