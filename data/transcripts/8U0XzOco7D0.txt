[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   This is a review of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu memes with Ryan Hall
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.040]   that we did after our podcast conversation.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.040]   Memes are at once the lowest
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.200]   and the highest form of achievement
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.440]   by the collective intelligence of human civilization.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.080]   I enjoy forcing brilliant people to be silly,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.600]   hence this meme review.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   It's brought to you by Babbel, BetterHelp, and Raycon.

[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.080]   And now, here's Jiu-Jitsu Meme Review with Ryan Hall.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.000]   Another ridiculous thing I have to ask,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.320]   I printed out because I'm old school,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.600]   some memes for you from Reddit.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.520]   It'd be nice if you, what do I, go through 'em
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.920]   and maybe, what's your favorite number?
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.760]   - 12.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.080]   - Okay, so on a scale of one to 12,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.120]   let's give a ranking to these ridiculous memes.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.560]   - I support all of these, guys.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.520]   Anyone with the mustache-io'd,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.720]   like Fisticuffs guy is always funny.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.160]   - So any meme that involves-- (laughs)
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.160]   - That guy's always, whatever's about to come next
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.960]   is usually pretty entertaining.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.720]   It's tough to give a rating without understanding
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   the universe of other memes that exist here,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.360]   but all right, I'll try to do my best.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.200]   (laughs)
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.520]   - Yeah, yeah, you gotta make decisions.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.360]   - All right, you're right, you're right.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.120]   - So this is sobbing after adult class.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.160]   - Sobbing after adult class.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.040]   I think, is that man holding on to a piece,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.680]   biting a piece of soap?
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.360]   - That's actually, I don't know if you've seen,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.880]   it's, what's that show?
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   It's Tobias from--
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.440]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.040]   - Oh, you talking about Arrested Development?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.960]   - I think it's Arrested Development, Tobias.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   That's what that looks like.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.800]   I don't know.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.880]   Maybe it's not. - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   All right, I'll give it a four.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.040]   (laughs)
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.360]   - Wow, that's not good.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120]   - No, maybe four's really high, who knows?
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   - It could be.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.280]   You're a tough grader.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.320]   - You move so well, practice.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.600]   It must be an innate gift, a gift from God.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.520]   It's practice.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.960]   I'll never understand how some people are so talented.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.120]   A mystery, practice.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.480]   That one hits relatively close to home.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360]   - That's one of those deep philosophical ones
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.200]   as opposed to funny.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.560]   - Yeah, it's not funny, it's just accurate.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.400]   - Yeah, it's accurate.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   - So would you give good scores for accuracy?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.400]   - I'm here for the jokes.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   - Okay.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.160]   - All right, so I'll give it a four also.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.560]   - Do you get this, by the way?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.240]   This kind of experience?
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.080]   - What's that?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   - Where a lot of people are like,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.960]   "Well, Ryan Hall is just talented."
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.040]   - Well, I think, I mean, like,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   maybe I just don't think that I'm very talented, you know?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.840]   So I mean, I just do nothing but martial arts
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080]   all day, every day, and have done nothing but that.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.720]   - I mean, do you believe anybody can get good?
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560]   - No.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.400]   - Essentially?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   - Oh yeah, it depends.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.320]   I think if there's the only talent
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.560]   that I think I have is discipline and grit.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.400]   - That's interesting.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   That could be genetic or whatever.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.240]   - I think that's a real thing.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   But you can't convince me to quit.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.200]   But a friend of mine, someone said,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.680]   like, "If I can talk you out of your dream,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   "you don't want your dream."
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.920]   And I think that's true.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040]   And where people go, "Oh my, someone so discouraged me."
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.360]   I'm like, "I hear what you're saying,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.600]   "but if you really, really wanna do any X, Y, or Z,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.880]   "you will decide to do it."
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I firmly believe that.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.520]   And again, whether that's true or not,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.920]   it falls under the category of facilitative belief.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.600]   And that will probably make you a little bit more,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.840]   you know, more of a go-getter in certain regards.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.080]   So I guess, yeah.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.560]   But I don't think I'm particularly talented.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   I just care a lot.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400]   Okay, oh yes, he's employing a sumo geisha
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.960]   landing into a kiss of salami hold.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.400]   Anybody, Judo guy opening his book of terminology.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.080]   I think they could actually expand that
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.360]   to modern jujitsu guy who now tries to use Japanese words
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.400]   for all sorts of stuff.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   - What's the arm lock in that?
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.040]   I don't even, I'm a Judo person.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.880]   - Jujigatami?
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.700]   - Jujigatami.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.360]   Do you use like Japanese terms for techniques?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.320]   - Not when I'm speaking to English speakers.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.360]   - What do you think about like Eddie Bravo
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.000]   just renaming every technique?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.200]   - I mean, that's weird to me too.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.320]   - That's the full range of them.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.360]   There's the two ends of the spectrum
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.800]   and you gotta find what's right for you.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.240]   You know, you've got--
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.440]   - What do you call an arm lock?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   - An arm lock.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.100]   - Okay.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.360]   - Yeah, you know the one?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.720]   Yeah, come on, man.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.960]   No, not that one, the other one.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.640]   - All right.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.360]   But yeah, it's, again, I think that there's a lot of people
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.200]   gotta do what's right for you,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.480]   but there's also, I struggle with the branding
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.960]   going on that I see in jujitsu.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.400]   That's not something I'm super stoked about and not,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.240]   you know, but again, if it helps you remember,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.160]   then right on.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.520]   - One to 12, what does this ridiculous meme get?
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.440]   - Oh, again, disturbingly accurate.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.280]   I'll say six.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.360]   - So you're giving props to the accurate.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.800]   All right.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.160]   I mean, these memes are horrible.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.320]   Like, Redd needs to do better.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.400]   - Yeah, this one needs to be better.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.920]   The best defense against a body triangle is to get really fat
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.520]   that is a strong defense.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   Let's all agree with that.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   I'll give that one a two.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.880]   - I think I only pick memes that get like several hundred
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.360]   and a half votes.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   So these, at least Redditors thought they're of value.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240]   - Figured this would be the best way
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.480]   to get rid of coronavirus.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   - Put a blue belt on that.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.360]   - I like that one.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.280]   - Oh, okay.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.120]   - What do you get?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.640]   - I was about to say that went over my head.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   - 'Cause everybody quits after they get a blue belt.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.780]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.880]   (laughing)
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.520]   I was like, why is teaching martial arts gonna help?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.400]   - So you get, 'cause you don't get it,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.200]   what that's like an undefined score.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   - I'll give it a 12.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.880]   - I think it's an explanation.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.320]   - It's way smarter than that.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.880]   - John, what do you give that one?
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.520]   You got a 12.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.720]   - I'll say a 10.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.920]   - I'll give it, I would give that one a 10, I think.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.560]   Yeah, I like that one.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.280]   - After two hours of hard sparring, you look good.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.240]   After 10 minutes of cardio, you look good.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.280]   - Yeah, you look like that.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.600]   That's a...
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   - No, that's you.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.240]   (laughing)
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.080]   - I think it's the reverse.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.000]   - Well, I would have to do cardio
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.520]   in order to understand that.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.360]   - Yeah, have you ever done cardio?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   - Again, it goes well over my head.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.880]   I ran once.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.160]   - You, what, for a bus?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.200]   - Running breeds cowardice.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.680]   I don't wanna do it, but yeah.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.880]   (laughing)
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.760]   Don't wanna get too involved, but yeah.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.160]   - So yeah, so maybe you can review this later
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.400]   once you actually try cardio.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.240]   - Exactly.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.480]   - All right.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.160]   When you get submitted 46 times,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.560]   but none of the submissions are IBJJF legal.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.520]   - I, I mean, yeah.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   - I gotta say, I gotta say that.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.560]   Gonna give that a two.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.480]   - Okay, all right.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.560]   I thought you were going to the negatives, but it's good.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   - Yeah, about to say, was that appropriate?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   Negative two.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.400]   I was trying to be charitable.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.560]   All right, me who got promoted during COVID
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.600]   waiting to actually roll in my new belt.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.240]   - People thought these were funny?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.760]   (laughing)
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.560]   - I'll take that as a one.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.720]   - Yeah, I'll take that as a one.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.760]   All right, how 90% of BJJ instructionals.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.680]   This one also hits close to home.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.200]   I gotta give it a six for the accuracy.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.880]   - Okay, guys, that's, I can't, I do the same thing.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.680]   - By the way, I think you're the next,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.800]   you're instructional is in the next meme.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.120]   So just so you know.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.960]   - Are they really?
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.000]   Oh man, okay, I don't want to look at it yet.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.920]   I'm sure they're saying something funny about me
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.080]   that's entirely accurate.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   So 90%, let's give that a six.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.200]   - So this is like an old school meme
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   where you insert anything overly expensive.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.400]   - Overly expensive during an economic crisis.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.240]   Food, data, rent, half-guard DVDs, utility, 150,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   someone who's good at the economy,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   please help me budget this.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.320]   My family is dying.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   All right, I'm gonna give that an 11.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.120]   Out on a scale of 12.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.560]   - The comment is like, spend less on half-guard DVDs.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.280]   - No, yeah, no.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.200]   I like it, that's solid.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.440]   All right, what the guy who murders you on the mat
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.680]   looks like outside the, that's absolutely accurate.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   If you guys have ever met Paul Schreiner,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.480]   you'd know exactly what's going on.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.640]   Dude, I still remember my first day at Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.240]   and this is where Jiu-Jitsu became
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.520]   like the coolest thing in the universe to me,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   was there was a guy named Eric Ryerson,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.760]   nice guy, he was at Ronin Athletics in New York,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.080]   this was 2004, and he was a white belt.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.360]   He was probably 130 pounds soaking wet,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.960]   and he was a white belt.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.880]   And again, he didn't hold a banner for tough guy,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.760]   certainly not at that time,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.920]   but you know, like, I'll try to fight you.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.080]   And just getting absolutely mollywopped by this guy,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.160]   and then going, holy crap,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.200]   this is literally the coolest thing
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.640]   I've ever experienced in my life, this is like magic.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.480]   And it's not even like, oh, this guy's a black belt
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.920]   something or other, and he's been at it for X time.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   How long you been training for?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.760]   I don't know, like eight months,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.480]   I'm like, you have all my money.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.920]   Like, you're never gonna get rid of me.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480]   And yeah. - That's a magic moment,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.800]   when you realize that the technique matters,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   it's fascinating.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   - Yeah, well, he basically, I'm sure he wrote,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   if the bird scooter had existed at the time,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.320]   Eric would have transported himself to the gym,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.600]   and to and from the gym on that,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.080]   so I'm gonna give that also an 11.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.240]   - Stache too. - The stache.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.760]   He didn't have the stache,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.040]   but I don't think that was in at the time.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.040]   - Yeah, it wasn't essential.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.780]   - Yeah, when your teammate is losing the match,
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.880]   but you promised you would record the whole thing.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.360]   Eh, I'm gonna give that a one.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.840]   - I like the old school digital camera.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.320]   - Yeah, that is true, I remember that, that actually.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.600]   - That was a thing before smartphones.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.680]   - Did you ever kick your ass so bad,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.720]   you drive the speed limit home with no music playing?
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.520]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.480]   - How often have you, have you felt that recently?
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.000]   I remember feeling that often,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.360]   I usually would take the bus home,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.200]   and I would just sit there, no music, no podcast,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.040]   it was just this sad feeling, overcoming your body,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.720]   life is meaningless.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.880]   - I remember when I first met Marillo Santana,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.760]   like it was yesterday, it was the winter,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.200]   'cause he has family that lives in the DC area,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.560]   and we had our school in Arlington,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.440]   and Marillo has a beard out to here,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   and he's wearing a Fidel Castro looking hat,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.440]   and I'd never met him, he was in ADCC,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.000]   and this was right after ADCC 2009,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.320]   so this was December 2009,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.720]   and it's snowing, and he's standing outside the gym,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.600]   I'm like, "Who the hell's that?"
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.840]   And I walk up, I'm like, "Hey man, can I help you?"
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.920]   He's like, "Hey, got a trade with you?"
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.680]   I'm like, "Are you Marillo Santana?"
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.520]   "Yeah."
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.360]   I'm like, "All right."
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.240]   And he comes upstairs, and super polite, nice guy,
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.960]   and anyway, so I'd done the 66 kilos, and he did 77.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   He says, "Hey, you wanna roll?"
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.800]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.560]   And Marillo's had the world's deepest voice
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   since he was a child, and I believe he had a beard
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.800]   when he came out of the womb,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.960]   but anyway, we're training, and I'm like,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.080]   "All right, not that good, but I'd done ADCC that year,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.980]   "I got third, I'd beaten some good guys,
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.680]   "had a really close match with Leo Vieira
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.560]   "that I got screwed in, thank you, referees at ADCC."
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.080]   That was decent at the time, at least,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.320]   and you get the feeling where I'm like,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   I can't fully understand what's going on here,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.640]   but I feel like I'm being let off the hook.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.040]   I'm like, "I'm not escaping this."
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.400]   I'm like, "Hey man, you can beat me up."
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.680]   You know, he's like, "Oh, I'm trying."
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.200]   I'm like, "No, come on."
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.840]   He's like, "All right, we're gonna try a little harder."
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.240]   And he's not being like, he's just being nice.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.320]   I remember I had like a thousand yard stare
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.920]   at the wall at home that night forever,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.600]   'cause it wasn't like, "Oh, people can't beat me up."
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   There were plenty of people who'd beat me up,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.000]   particularly at that time, but it's like,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.240]   I think he passed my guard like 35 times.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.400]   And that was something that wasn't happening,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240]   like for the most part.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.080]   And I'm like, "It's you to rest."
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.920]   Oh, he's a little bigger.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yeah, that wasn't the problem.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.880]   It was a skill thing, and just going like,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.720]   "What was that?"
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.100]   And it wasn't like, "Oh, I get to play.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.800]   "We're gonna both train and he's gonna win."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.880]   I'm like, "We're not training.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.080]   "I'm just getting like chucked around like a four-year-old.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.520]   "I don't know any jiu-jitsu.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.840]   "I need to reevaluate my entire life."
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.280]   Murillo is a fantastic instructor and trainer
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.000]   in addition to being a great competitor
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.680]   and runs Unity Jiu-Jitsu in New York City.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.200]   I feel lucky to have trained with many
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.760]   of the very, very best guys in the world,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.560]   but man, Murillo's as good as anyone I've ever met,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.040]   as good as anyone I've ever met.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   Absolutely fantastic.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   Just a fantastic knowledge of jiu-jitsu.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   And I watched it, I remember just training periodically
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.000]   over time, over time, over time.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.400]   I would get better, the gap would stay the same.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.920]   And it was pretty cool and it was inspiring.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.760]   It really taught me a lot.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.000]   It's the only way you get better, right?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.440]   So yes, I know exactly about.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.280]   So this-
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.120]   I watched other people do the same thing.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.640]   We would train and like, I don't wanna use them.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.180]   People that everybody would know.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.800]   We would sit in the back of my like beater Honda Civic
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.240]   that I had at that time
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.360]   and watch them stare out the window like this.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.560]   (laughing)
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.040]   And just like, "Yep, been there, buddy."
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   (laughing)
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.360]   Like a tear slowly-
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.720]   Oh yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.560]   Just the one.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.720]   (laughing)
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.560]   Yeah, okay.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.960]   So this is another one of those memes
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.480]   that's just entirely accurate.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.640]   Yeah, so I'll give that an 11.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.480]   All right.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.640]   All right, guy watching UFC.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.080]   I don't get all this ground stuff.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.480]   I wish I knew an expert who could explain it to me.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.800]   Two stripe white belt.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.240]   Yeah, that's also accurate.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.400]   Little less funny, but I don't know enough
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.120]   about SpongeBob SquarePants to be able to like understand
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   what that expression means.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.520]   Yeah, but-
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   'Cause usually it would involve like, you know,
