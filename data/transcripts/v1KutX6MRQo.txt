[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Joshua writes in and asks,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.640]   "I'm the pastor of a small congregation
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.380]   "in Western North Carolina.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.120]   "It has been very difficult to get people excited
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   "about serving the Lord in the local church,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.560]   "and hence there are only a few committed people
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.840]   "serving here.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.520]   "Because of this lack of interest to serve,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.200]   "ministry growth is being stunted.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.040]   "Pastor John, what advice would you give me
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.800]   "to help people get excited about serving Christ?"
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.040]   - Well, I am really eager to say something helpful,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.600]   if I can, about that, because I've seen it done badly,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   and I've seen it done well,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.760]   and I've tried to do it myself for 33 years as a pastor.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.700]   I know pastors want their people to love the church,
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.200]   and love service, and link arms with the pastor,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.840]   and throw themselves in with joy,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.880]   and when it doesn't happen, it can be really discouraging.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.880]   I've seen it done badly.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.680]   My wife and I were in a church,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.040]   that was probably 10 years ago, on vacation in a town,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.360]   and we decided to go to church Sunday evening,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.240]   and we went, and it was the most berating sermon
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.560]   we had ever heard.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.940]   This pastor, for 30 minutes, was spanking his people,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.320]   criticizing his people, complaining to his people,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.300]   and the issue was Wednesday night attendance.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.560]   And when we walked out, Noel, my wife,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   never criticizes anybody.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.660]   She said to me in the car on the way home,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.020]   I don't think we'll go back there.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.080]   I mean, that's a documentation of how not to do it.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.140]   It just doesn't do any good to use the pulpit
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.220]   to spank your people.
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.300]   On the other hand, when I was out of love with the church,
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.820]   and wondering if the church, like an idiot,
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.220]   wondering if the church had any future in 1968 and '69,
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.220]   when I was 20 years old, 22 years old,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.580]   I went to Ray Ortland Senior's church in Pasadena,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.420]   and Sunday after Sunday, watch this man in the pulpit
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.420]   love his God, love his church, and love his ministry,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.340]   and summon people into his loves.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.900]   And everything in me fell in love with the church.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.860]   So the simple answer there was,
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.460]   here was a man who so manifestly exalted
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.660]   over the word of God,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.620]   so manifestly exalted over the church of God,
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.200]   and over the ministry God had called him to,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.940]   how could you not want that?
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940]   He was so happy in his ministry,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.100]   and so loved his ministry,
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.780]   that I'm just all frustrated here in my pew,
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.900]   and he's happy in the pulpit.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.700]   There's a way to fix this, you know?
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.260]   I want what he has.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.740]   And so I think the key there,
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.540]   and this is what I tried to do for 33 years
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.820]   with more or less success,
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.540]   I think the key to motivating people for ministry
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.340]   is to talk more about God and less about ministry.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.020]   When people have asked me,
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.140]   how do you motivate people for world missions?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.100]   I say, stop talking about world missions,
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.420]   and start talking about a global God.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.380]   And I don't mean just talk about him, I mean love him.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.500]   I mean exalt in him, I mean blow people away
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.100]   with his vision for this world,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.780]   and his absolute promises that this gospel
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.540]   is gonna be preached to all the nations,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900]   and the glories that's gonna happen for this Christ
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.700]   when all the nations stream to him.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.500]   People don't get excited about burdens
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440]   being laid on their back.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.060]   They get excited about a burden lifter.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.100]   They get excited about a God infinitely worthy
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.980]   of their allegiance and their worship.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.300]   So my counsel is at the beginning of a ministry,
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.220]   and really I suppose anywhere along the ministry,
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.660]   put very little emphasis on programs.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.420]   Put very little emphasis on activities in the church.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.020]   Don't come into a church and say,
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.580]   okay, we got these five activities,
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.620]   and I'm in here to revitalize those five activities.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.380]   That's just a crazy way to go about church renewal.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.740]   Rather, put a huge emphasis on heralding,
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.420]   exalting over the greatness of God,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.860]   the unsearchable riches of Christ,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.940]   the glories of our salvation,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.860]   the wonders of the Bible,
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.860]   and weave into that a life of prayer for your people
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.020]   that God would give them a taste for this glory
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.800]   so that they don't feel forced.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.620]   They have a desire and a longing
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.580]   because God has become something amazing to them
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.580]   'cause you really don't want any other kind of service, do you?
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.980]   You don't want service because you've scared them into it
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.100]   or twisted their arm into it.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.100]   You want service that is overflowing out of...
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.340]   Here's a story.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.700]   I came to Bethlehem 33 years ago,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.780]   and there was a corps of people.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.620]   It was small, who didn't like me,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.020]   and they stonewalled me.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.160]   They wouldn't sing the songs.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.100]   They folded their arms.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.220]   They sat on the back pew.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.940]   There were about 11 pews in those days.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.860]   They sat on the back one.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.340]   They were just like really close 'cause 11 is not many,
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.320]   and I did everything I knew to win them over,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.160]   and finally, I just said to them,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.180]   you know, I love you,
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.060]   and I intend to outrejoice you and outlast you,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.220]   (laughs)
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.460]   and I did.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.100]   They were all gone eventually.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.540]   Some of them won over.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.600]   Some of them just vanished,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   and my point is I didn't try to get them into service.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.420]   Like if I could just get them into service,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.140]   I didn't want them in service.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.860]   They would be bad blood everywhere.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.460]   I wanted them to love Christ and to love the gospel
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.700]   and to love singing and to love worshiping
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.860]   and yes, to love me,
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.300]   but I was not going to be drug down to their level
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.780]   and fold my arms, become bitter, and become angry.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.940]   I really wanted to so exult over Christ
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.500]   that they would see,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.580]   and I give thanks to all the ones who did,
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.820]   and I pray that those who left
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.580]   might have found it in another place,
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.580]   so my last word is don't preach and teach
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.300]   and labor over programs and activities.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.240]   Give yourself to the word and to the glories of God.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.260]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
