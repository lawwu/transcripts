[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Well, how do we break free from triviality in order to cultivate habits of deep thinking
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.880]   and all for the sake of increasing our delight in God?
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.400]   It's a question that comes to us from a podcast listener named Michael.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.840]   "Hello Pastor John, how do you think deeply when you have created by whichever way a superficial
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.800]   manner of thinking that skirts matters and gets bored before you have gotten to any real
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.440]   depth?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.080]   And if you do get bored, how can you challenge yourself to still engage with a matter or
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   a biblical passage without feeling blasÃ©?"
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.640]   Michael has given half the answer to his question, I think.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:55.380]   He has said, "How do you think deeply when you have created a superficial manner of thinking?"
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.440]   This is really a huge part of the answer to the last half of his question, namely, what
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.520]   do you do if you get bored before you even engage with the biblical passage long enough
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   to see anything profound?
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.500]   And the answer to that second half of the question is addressed in the first half, namely,
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.080]   the more basic superficial mindset needs to be reversed.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.660]   That superficial mindset that has built up over time needs to be undone, reversed.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.560]   And I think this is a very perceptive question and touches on an issue that is epidemic among
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.800]   human beings in general, in every age and perhaps more than ever in our age of ever
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.400]   present distraction by superficial input from every manner of media.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   The epidemic I'm talking about is the tragic loss of wonder and amazement and all joyful
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.880]   discovery of beauties and glories in the world and in the word and in our own selves, the
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.120]   loss of it.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.160]   Human beings really are glorious creatures, a little less than God, the psalmist says,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.880]   in the image of God, full of potential to know God and to know things the way God knows
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.920]   them and feel with the affections that even God has in his own heart.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.640]   And yet we are, as one author put it, glorious ruins.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   We have fallen.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.240]   And one of the great evidences of our fall is that we are so easily bored with glorious
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.960]   reality.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   We go to visit the magnificent Rockies or Alps or Himalayas and for a day or two, we
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.860]   are breathless with amazement.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.920]   And by the end of the week, we're sitting in front of the television in our chalet on
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.360]   top of the mountain, watching pitiful human cinematic efforts to create amazement.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.480]   That's just who we are.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   It's tragic.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.320]   It's the great tragic effect of the fall, superficiality in a world of wonder, easy
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   boredom, loving something for two, three repetitions and then after that, oh hum.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:30.680]   So Michael is not alone in this entanglement with small trifling, trivial, empty, insignificant,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   silly input from every side.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:44.120]   And the question is, how do you rebuild a mindset that might wake up to the sleepwalking
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.060]   of silliness that postures as meaningful life?
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.560]   The first thing you do is repent and confess to God that this is a huge problem and involves
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920]   much sin.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.520]   Then you cry out to God for help that he would wake you up from the slumbers of emptiness
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   and meaninglessness and boredom in the endless quest to be titillated in body while the soul
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.520]   is languishing and starving for greatness.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.600]   So you cry out for help to God.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.960]   And then you set yourself on a conscious quest to obey God's strategy for cultivating a spiritual
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.800]   mind that is fully alert to the glories of God, radiant in the world and radiant in the
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.080]   word.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.400]   You make Colossians 3, 1 to 3, your marching orders.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.440]   If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.560]   is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.040]   Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth for you have
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.720]   died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.600]   So you pray that God would cause you to be stunned by the meaning of those verses and
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.840]   be disciplined in the pursuit of that new mindset of setting your minds on things that
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   are above.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.000]   Then you go over to Philippians 4, verse 8 to get specific and you realize the challenge
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   before you.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.240]   pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there's any excellence, if there's anything
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.920]   worthy of praise, think about these things.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:51.200]   In other words, Paul is calling us to discipline the focus of our minds so that we fix the
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.720]   mind, the focus of the mind on things that are worthy and that have the potential to
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.640]   deepen and strengthen and purify our souls.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.840]   The specifics that I would recommend would be these.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.160]   First that you be part of a local church where the preaching is blood earnest and serious,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:23.040]   where God besotted joy and not flippant silliness marks the wonders of the word of God.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   That's first.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.560]   Second, I would look carefully at my friendships.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.680]   Who am I spending time with?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.640]   And I would remember first Corinthians 15 33 do not be deceived.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.240]   Bad company ruins good morals.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.420]   Superficiality is a very, very, very contagious disease.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.060]   If you only hang out with superficial people, you will almost certainly be superficial.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.160]   If you only hang out with superficial social media and TV programs, you will almost certainly
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   be a superficial person.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:12.520]   On the other hand, Proverbs 13 20 says, whoever walks with the wise becomes wise.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.200]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:24.780]   Psalm 1 1963 says, I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:32.560]   And Hebrews 10 24 says, let us consider, think about, ponder, consider how to stir up one
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.680]   another to love.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:42.280]   Love is the greatest thing in all the universe if we understand what God understands by love.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:52.560]   And the last thing I would say is read, read, read the great dead Puritan writers whose
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.920]   works are unlike anything you will find in the 20th and 21st century because they are
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.000]   so non superficial, non silly, non trivial, non man centered.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.720]   The works of Jonathan Edwards and John Owen and Jeremiah Burroughs and John Bunyan and
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.840]   JC Ryle and Charles Spurgeon, John Newton.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.360]   I'm thinking of you, Tony.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   John Newton.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:27.960]   A steady diet of these authors will go a long way to reversing a superficial mindset
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:36.800]   and replacing it with a deeply joyful mind ready to discover wonders and be amazed everywhere
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.120]   we look.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   So these authors, I think, will drive us back to the Word of God with eyes that are able
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.200]   to see the glories that God really did put there.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   Amen.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   And thanks for mentioning John Newton.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   As many of you know, I'm not really a podcast host.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.240]   I'm actually a writer and an author.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.080]   And this was an allusion to my book, John Newton on the Christian Life.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.200]   Thank you for the mention, Pastor John.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   John Newton on the Christian Life.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.540]   I wrote that back in 2015.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.120]   If you cannot get enough of the Ask Pastor John podcast, you can join our many listeners

[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   Well Friday we close the week with a personal question for you, Pastor John.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.880]   A listener named Tim from the UK, he wants to press into all of this joy talk that we
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.800]   have and he wants to know, is John Piper happy?
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.960]   That's putting it rather bluntly.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.720]   And is the question on the table next time?
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.320]   I'm your host Tony Renke and we'll see you then.
