[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   You will recall that we are still considering together the biblical doctrine of the Atonement.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.520]   And having considered a fortnight ago some of the false theories which have been elaborated
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.840]   and put forward at various times in the history of the Church, we came last Friday evening
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.000]   to a consideration of what is regarded and described always as the essential Protestant
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.360]   doctrine.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.080]   Concerning this, not that it is confined by any means to the period in the Church subsequent
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.320]   to the Protestant Reformation, because it could be shown clearly and easily that it
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.120]   has in a sense always been the main doctrine and exposition of the doctrine of the Atonement
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.680]   from the very beginning, but it is often called the Protestant emphasis. A better name is
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.180]   of course to call it the substitutionary teaching of the Atonement, the doctrine which emphasizes
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.240]   the substitutionary and the penal elements in the Atonement.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   We summarized it like this. We described it as the doctrine which teaches that the Lord
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   Jesus Christ vicariously suffered the penalty of the broken law as the substitute of his
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:34.680]   people. And we began last Friday to adduce arguments to demonstrate that particular view
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   of the Atonement, and we arrived at seven arguments. May I hurriedly remind you of them.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.880]   The first was the analogy from the Old Testament sacrifices, which are obviously piacular,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.600]   expiatory, substitutionary. The sins were transferred to the animal that was to be killed,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.960]   and it was the death and the shedding of the blood of the animal that makes the expiation,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.320]   expunges, wipes out the sin.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   Now the argument was that all those point forward to Christ, and the New Testament in
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.200]   turn teaches that what he did is in line with those. It is a very powerful argument.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.160]   Then secondly, the New Testament teaches that our Lord saves us by his death. We had notable
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.720]   statements of that as we read that fifth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans just now. I need
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420]   not stay with that.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.340]   Then the third argument was certain New Testament terms such as ransom, propitiation, reconciliation—terms
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.780]   we have already considered. I am simply recapitulating.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.420]   The fourth argument was certain New Testament terms which teach substitution explicitly
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.140]   and specifically, and especially those that emphasize this vicarious element. He died
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:07.660]   for—the three different meanings of that word—for us, for our sins, and so on.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.260]   Then the next argument was, number five, that all statements that emphasize our union with
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.340]   Christ really teach that. I shall come back to that this evening, so I leave it at that
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.340]   now.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.860]   The sixth was that all statements which say that his death liberates us from the law are
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.780]   really teaching this substitutionary and penal aspect. Again, I will have to say a word about
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.780]   that.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.300]   And the seventh argument was the statements that emphasize God's activity in the death
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.700]   of our Lord. God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. He, God, hath made
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900]   him to be sin for us who knew no sin.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.060]   And there are many other statements which put the same emphasis and deliver us from
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.820]   the idea that the main purpose of our Lord's death is to do something to us, or that it
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.340]   was even only something that he did himself. This whole idea that it was the action of
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.620]   God surely teaches the substitutionary view, and rarely that alone.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.900]   I ended by saying that I had another argument, a final argument, the eighth argument. And
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.260]   speaking for myself, this next argument is one of the most cogent of them all, if not
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.860]   indeed the most cogent. So I would put it in this form. We are going to consider statements
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.140]   in the Scriptures which emphasize the fact that the death of our Lord upon the cross
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.620]   was an utter, absolute necessity. Obviously, these are very crucial matters. The Bible
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.740]   teaches that the death of our Lord upon the cross was an absolute necessity. Now then,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.060]   I would subdivide the statements in this way. First of all, there are certain statements
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.460]   which are made about our Lord's own conduct, and certain things which he said, which prove,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.300]   it seems to me, quite conclusively and finally, that his death was an absolute necessity.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:35.780]   The first, of course, is what we are told about what took place in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:44.380]   Why did our Lord endure that agony? Why did he sweat those great drops of blood? What
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.700]   is the meaning of it? How can we really explain that? If it was a martyr's death, it is
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.060]   obviously a totally inadequate explanation. The martyrs haven't behaved like that face
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.980]   to face with death. Our Lord there was facing the fact that there was an element in his
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:11.340]   death which was utterly abhorrent to him, something that caused him such agony as to
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:18.020]   lead to this blood-stained sweat. We've got to explain that. It's got to be accounted
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.500]   for. And I suggest to you that all those other ideas and theories about the atonement completely
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.780]   fail to account for that. But you remember, we are left not only with the need of explaining
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.420]   what took place in the Garden, but also what our Lord said. You remember his prayer, "Father,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:47.420]   if it be possible, let this cup pass by." He goes on to say, "Nevertheless, not my
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.860]   will but thine be done." But the request was there, "If it be possible, let this
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.140]   cup pass by." Now that can't refer merely to the fact of physical death, for again it
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.820]   obviously makes him inferior to the martyrs, his own followers. No, I say again, there
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.580]   was something which he foresaw as going to happen in his death, which he was anxious
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:22.380]   to avoid if it was possible. Now, we must emphasize this. It was the only time during
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.620]   his earthly life that our Lord ever made a request like this to his father. And obviously
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.220]   therefore it was something very exceptional. It points to this, that there was something
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.820]   in his death that was an absolute necessity. He says, the question he asks is, is it an
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:49.100]   absolute necessity? Is it possible for me to do this work in any other way? If it be
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:56.940]   possible, let this cup pass by. Let not this happen. If it is possible, nevertheless, he
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:04.140]   says, if it is not possible, I submit to it. Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.900]   Now there surely is a final and an absolutely conclusive argument to the effect that the
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.500]   death of our Lord upon the cross in the way in which it happened was an utter absolute
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:24.780]   necessity. Nothing can be stronger. But then we can add to that something that confirms
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:33.580]   it and in a sense repeats it. And that is, of course, the cry of dereliction upon the
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:43.700]   cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Now no doctrine of the atonement is
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.220]   adequate which does not explain that. And again, it is obviously inadequate to suggest
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.340]   that mere physical suffering produced that cry. Again, the whole argument of the martyrs
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:03.220]   comes in. No, no, there was something happening there which is in a category on its own. Our
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:11.980]   Lord was there conscious of being forsaken of God. His contact with the Eternal Father
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.060]   was temporarily broken. He who had come from the eternal bosom and was with God from the
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:26.180]   beginning for the one and only time in all eternity was not able to see the face of God.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:34.100]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Surely, again, here is another of those
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:41.740]   all important and conclusive arguments which demonstrates beyond any caveat whatsoever
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.220]   that when a thing like that happened, there is only one reason for it. It had to happen.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.740]   It is an utter absolute necessity. None of the other theories really account for the
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.980]   cry of dereliction upon the cross.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:08.740]   Then the second group of statements which I am quoting, I would term as statements which
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:16.480]   state this absolute necessity directly. Those others have been stating it more or less indirectly,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:26.500]   but here now is something direct. The specific statement which is to be found in the epistle
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   to the Romans in the third chapter, in verses 25 and 26, which is undoubtedly the locus
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:45.840]   classicus in connection with this whole subject. Romans 3, 25 and 26, "Whom God hath set forth
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.300]   to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.920]   remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God, to declare, I say, at
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:05.460]   this time his righteousness, God's righteousness, that he, God, might be just, and the justifier
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.720]   of him which believeth in Jesus." Now that is a tremendous statement. You see, what he
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:21.400]   is saying is this, that the problem that arises is, how could God overlook or cover the sins
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.680]   of the children of Israel under the old dispensation? How can we account for the remission of sins
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.600]   that are past through the forbearance of God? And Paul's answer is that the death of our
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   Lord upon the cross does that, that that is one of the things that it is meant to do.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.080]   But he says it goes beyond that. It not only explains how God could cover the sins that
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:54.760]   are past, it explains how God can forgive sin at any time. And it is the only explanation
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:03.600]   of it. Here is the problem. How can God at one and the same time be just, and yet the
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   justifier of him that believeth in Jesus? How can this eternal, holy God, who is just
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.280]   and righteous and unchangeable, the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.400]   shadow of turning, the God who is light and in whom is no darkness at all, the God who
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.040]   is of such a pure countenance that he cannot even behold evil and sin, how can he forgive
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:36.560]   sin and still remain what he eternally is? And the answer that the apostle gives is this,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.600]   that the only way in which God can do that is what he did to his Son upon the cross.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.800]   He hath set him forth as a propitiation of sins. And he has done it in that way, to declare,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.520]   I say, at this time his righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of him
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:03.920]   which believeth in Jesus. And you see, there is only one explanation of this. God is just
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:13.200]   and yet forgives sins because he has punished sin. As a just God must, he has done so in
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.480]   the person of his only begotten Son. So he remains righteous, he remains just. He has
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.440]   done to sin what he said he would do to sin. And yet because he has done it in the substitute,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.320]   he can forgive us, he can justify us who believe in Jesus.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:37.600]   Now the argument of the apostle is that that was the only way in which it could happen.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:44.400]   In other words, it was an utter, absolute necessity. There was no other way in which
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:51.160]   even God could have done it. For God to remain just and to forgive this which happened in
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.840]   Christ upon the cross when he was set forth as a propitiation is the thing that establishes
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.560]   it. And indeed I would say again that for myself, if I had no other text, that is to
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:12.240]   me enough. None of the other theories can explain that, and they don't. There is only
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   one way of explaining this. It is that what happened there was an absolute necessity.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   It was the only way in which, if I may so term it, the eternal character of God could
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.720]   be reconciled with itself and could be vindicated, not only before the whole world of men, but
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:37.480]   before the principalities and powers in heavenly places, indeed even before the devil and all
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:47.760]   the citizens of hell. God proclaims his eternal justice and yet can forgive the sins of those
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.800]   who believe in Jesus. A most amazing, a most profound statement.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:00.040]   And then my third and my last group under this heading I put like this. There are certain
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.600]   statements in the Scriptures which suggest that this was an absolute necessity. Take,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:15.960]   for instance, Hebrews 2.9, where the author says, "But we see Jesus, who was made a
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:23.160]   little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:31.760]   he by the grace of God should taste death for every man." He had to suffer death.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:39.160]   He had to taste death. Now take that word "taste." What a word it is, what a strong
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.320]   word. Do we realize the full content of that tasting? There is a sense in which it can
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.800]   be said that the Lord Jesus Christ is the only one who has ever tasted death, in all
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:55.840]   its bitterness and in all its horror. That was why we see him there sweating blood in
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.280]   the garden. That's why we hear him crying out upon the cross. That is why he died so
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.120]   soon and the authorities were surprised that he was already dead. That's why his heart
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.840]   literally broke, it actually ruptured. It was because he tasted it.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:23.680]   And my argument is this. Would God the Eternal Father ever allow his only begotten beloved
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.600]   Son to endure that, if it were not absolutely essential? But take another statement which
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:43.240]   says the same thing. Take Romans 8 and 32. "He that spared not his own son, but delivered
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.120]   him up for us all." How shall he not also with him freely give us all things? It's
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:57.600]   the first part I'm interested in now. "He that spared not." What does it mean? Spared
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:06.640]   him from what? Spared him from all that. Spared him from that agony, that shame. He delivered
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   him up. God delivered him. It was the Father who delivered him to that, who sent him to
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:20.720]   that. It was the only way. The Son volunteered, the Son went willingly, voluntarily, but it
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:28.800]   was the Father who delivered him, who sent him. He didn't spare him. And when the Son
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:37.520]   bore our sins, the Father spared him nothing. The full wrath of God against sin descended
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:46.160]   upon him. He wasn't spared anything at all. The full blast of it came upon him. "He that
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:54.840]   spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all." Indeed, John 3, 16 says exactly
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.680]   the same thing. God so loved the world that he gave, and that giving includes the shame
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:07.640]   and the suffering and the agony of the death upon the cross. And my argument again is this.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:16.800]   Is it conceivable that God would have delivered up his own son to that, even to the point
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.680]   of that break in the eternal contact that was between them? Is it conceivable, I ask,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:29.280]   that God would have done that unless it was an absolute necessity? Well, very well, this
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.160]   doctrine, this substitutionary, penal view of the doctrine of the atonement asserts all
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:43.120]   that. And that is why I say again that it is the only adequate and satisfactory explanation
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.880]   of the biblical doctrine of the atonement. But if you require certain subsidiary arguments,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.720]   take these. The doctrine of the wrath of God. If you believe at all in the doctrine of the
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.200]   wrath of God against sin, well then, obviously sin must be punished. The penal element comes
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:12.120]   in and that leads to the necessity of substitution. Or take this argument, the majesty and the
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:20.880]   immutability of the divine law. Not one jot nor one tittle of this shall pass away until
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.920]   all shall be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   The immutability of the law of God, because it is God's law, because it is the divine
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.500]   law. And then another argument is that if we do agree that sin is guilt and not merely
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.600]   something negative, not merely some weakness, not merely some failure to develop, if we
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.120]   agreed when we were considering the doctrine of sin that sin is transgression, that sin
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.320]   is lawlessness, and that sin therefore involves guilt, well obviously then you will have to
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.680]   agree that guilt's got to be dealt with. And that somehow or another it must be punished.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:11.120]   And this is the only view of the atonement that really does that. You remember John defines
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.640]   sin as the transgression of the law. That's the first epistle of John, chapter 3, verse
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:27.560]   4. And then lastly I put it like this. There is no other theory which really shows us why
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:35.640]   it is essential to believe in Christ and why it is believing in him and on him that saves
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:43.440]   us. Take any one of those other views. The moral influence view which tells us that the
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   love of God is displayed by the death of Christ upon the cross. It's supposed to melt our
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   hard hearts and to do away with our enmity against God. Well, very well then, I say if
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.280]   that is its function, what it does is to make me believe in God directly. It's simply a
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.840]   means to make me believe in God. I don't have to believe in Christ as such. He has merely
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.680]   shown me God. I don't believe in him, I believe in the God whom he's shown me. And if he's
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.560]   an example it's the same thing, and so with all the other theories. This is the only view
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.080]   of the atonement that shows us why we've got to believe in him, that we don't know God
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:32.240]   without believing in Christ, and that belief in Christ is the thing that saves us. Very
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.280]   well. Now then, that entitlement allows us to come
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   on to consider very hurriedly some of the objections that are brought forward to this
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.240]   particular teaching. Of course, all people who deny that sin is guilt disagree with this
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.280]   doctrine. I can't stay to argue that. We've already demonstrated that sin is guilt. But
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.720]   if you don't regard sin as something which renders you guilty, well, of course, you can't
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.200]   accept this doctrine. But if you regard sin as guilt, you must immediately accept this
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.600]   doctrine. Then there's an argument which says that surely God's love is enough. The argument
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:15.440]   is put like this. It says we forgive one another without any substitution and without any punishment.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.240]   And if we in our love for one another can forgive one another, surely God, whose love
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.600]   is still greater, should be able to do it with still greater ease. That's the argument.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:34.800]   To which, of course, the reply is this, that if God were only love, there might be some
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.600]   force in that argument. But God is God, and God is light, and God is holy, and God is
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.900]   just, and God is righteous. Not only that, there is no greater fallacy and no more fallacious
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:58.400]   type of argument than the argument that goes from men to God. It's a very common argument
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.160]   today. People are constantly arguing like that. If this is true of us, how much more
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.720]   so of God? As if God were in series with us. The truth being, of course, that we are in
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.620]   sin and that all our ideas are wrong, that our conception of love is more wrong than
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:20.260]   anything else, and that if we begin to think of God's love in terms of what we do and
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:28.380]   what we think, well then, I say it with reverence, God help us. If we are going to attribute
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:37.360]   our sentimental, loose, unjust, and unrighteous notions of love to the everlasting Godhead,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   well then we place ourselves in the most precarious position.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.840]   Another way of stating that is to say that this substitutionary view of the atonement
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.000]   derogates from God's character, His justice. They say it would be unjust in God to punish
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.840]   someone who is innocent, to which the reply is that when the innocent volunteers and takes
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.360]   upon himself the sins of others and asks God to put them on him and to punish them in him,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.400]   there is obviously no injustice at all. This was the great decision of the eternal counsel
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:15.140]   between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Son said, "Here am I, send me," and God
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:21.880]   provided him a body. There was perfect agreement and therefore no injustice. I have just been
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.760]   dealing with the argument which says that it derogates from His love. They say, "Fancy
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.280]   God demanding blood to appease him before he can forgive," to which the reply is what
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.680]   I have just been saying. And then those who feel that we derogate from the pardoning grace
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:46.480]   of God because they say God demands a payment before forgiving. And again the argument is
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:54.540]   still the same, that the character of God must always be thought of in terms of its
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:01.640]   every aspect. The holiness, this justice that Paul speaks about, that God be just and the
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:08.600]   justifier and all the great and eternal attributes of God. God is one and all these things are
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:16.200]   true of God and are manifestations of God's character. And therefore this argument collapses.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.480]   Then another argument that one sometimes hears is this. It used to be very popular. It's
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   not as popular today, but still one finds it. They say, "You know, that substitutionary
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.760]   penal view of the atonement was the invention of the Apostle Paul." And they say, "You
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:38.080]   don't find it in the Gospels." And the argument was, and still is, that if it were
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.800]   true of course our Lord would have taught it. But you only find it in the epistles,
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.160]   to which the reply is that that isn't true. We saw last Friday night that our Lord did
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.320]   say this, "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:01.040]   give his life a ransom for men." It's all there in that word ransom, as we saw. But
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:09.840]   wait a minute, it's not the end of the argument. There were very good reasons why
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   our Lord couldn't give a full exposition of the doctrine of the atonement before he
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.300]   had accomplished it upon the cross. Do you remember what happened? Let me suggest this
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.360]   as a bit of research and homework for you. Read your Gospels and observe what happened
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.480]   every time our Lord spoke about his death. You will find that each time the disciples
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   misunderstood it, didn't grasp it, were cast down by it, objected to it. What's the
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.840]   explanation? Well, our Lord himself gives the explanation. He turned to them just at
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.000]   the end. You'll find this in the Gospel of John, chapter 16, verse 12, and he said,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.800]   "I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now." And they
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.360]   couldn't bear them. Every time he brought this teaching forward, they couldn't receive
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:07.000]   it. Their minds were darkened, their hearts seemed to be held. It's most interesting
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.960]   to watch that in the Gospel, and it's not difficult to understand this. Indeed, their
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   whole idea of him was still not clear. Peter had made his confession at Caesarea Philippi,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.160]   but he hadn't understood it all. It was the resurrection that convinced them of the
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.880]   ultimate truth concerning the fact that he was the only begotten Son of God. And in the
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.960]   light of that, they began to understand the atonement. After his resurrection, you remember
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.080]   we saw, he took them through it all, right through the Old Testament, and they were able
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.680]   to receive it. They couldn't receive it before. So that that argument, likewise, has
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:49.800]   no real substance and no real foundation. In other words, if I may sum it up, I'll
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.960]   put it in this form. The real difficulty people seem to get with this doctrine is generally
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:02.680]   due to the fact that their whole view of the person of God is inadequate. They forget one
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:09.480]   aspect of his character. They emphasize one side only, to the exclusion of others. If
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   they were to take God as he is and to realize the truth about God, their difficulties would
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:23.880]   vanish. There is one particular argument that I'm particularly anxious to demolish, and
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:30.040]   it is this. There are those who say, "I don't like that substitutionary penal view because
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:37.080]   what it says is this, that God was reluctant to forgive us, and that our Lord had to die
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.440]   and to go to God and plead his death and plead the merit of his blood before God would forgive."
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.360]   Unfortunately, that has been taught sometimes. Evangelical preachers have put the doctrine
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.080]   like that, and there are hymns which put it like that, as if our Lord is there having
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:01.040]   to plead with God and pleading the merit of his blood in order to persuade God to forgive.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.240]   It's a terrible travesty of the biblical truth. I've really already answered it when I put
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:16.720]   it like this. It is God himself who has done all this. Why did the sun ever come on earth?
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:24.560]   Why did the sun die? The answer is, God so loved the world. It was the love of God that
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.640]   thought out this way of salvation. It was the love of God that carried it out. It is
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.960]   not something that influences the love of God. The love of God has produced it. That's
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:45.200]   the order. Were it not for the love of God, God would have punished sin in us, and we
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   should all suffer eternal death. It was the love of God that, I say, produced this way
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.760]   and has carried out this way. So we must never start with the doctrine of the atonement and
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.880]   go up to the love of God as something which is influenced by it. We start with the love
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:18.560]   of God. It was the holy love of God, desirous of forgiving men, that produced and carried
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:26.040]   out this way of atonement so that God might be just and the justifier of him that believeth
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:34.920]   in Jesus. Indeed, I don't hesitate to go so far as to say this. There is nothing anywhere
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:43.320]   in the Scripture which in any way approaches the substitutionary and penal doctrine of
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:53.560]   the atonement as an exposition and an explanation of the love of God. Is there anything greater
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:01.320]   than this? That God should take your sins and mine and put them on his own son and punish
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:09.160]   his own son, not sparing him anything, causing him to suffer all that, that you and I might
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:16.480]   be forgiven. Can you tell me of any greater exhibition of the love of God than that? The
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.040]   moral influence theory and all these other theories which claim that they put themselves
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.120]   forward because they believe in the love of God are failing to comprehend the love of
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:37.480]   God. It is there you see the love of God. When his own son suffers as our substitute
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:45.400]   the penalty of the law that he and I have incurred and so richly deserve, I therefore
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.960]   claim he forgiven and reconciled to God fully before he can be justified. The law must be
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:58.120]   honored, it must be satisfied, it must be dealt with. And obviously that is something
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.080]   that must take place in two respects. First and foremost, the law comes to us and tells
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:12.040]   us that unless we keep it, unless we honor it, unless we live it, we are condemned. Moses
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.240]   describeth the righteousness which is of the law, says Paul, like this, that the man which
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:25.520]   doeth those things shall live by them. Before he can reconcile us to God, both those things
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.640]   have got to be done. He deals with the guilt as we have seen upon the cross. He was there
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:37.960]   passive. He offered himself. He presented himself, his body, his life, and God put our
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:44.920]   sins upon him. He was passive. God was doing it. It was God's action. Passive obedience.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.880]   Ah, yes, but in his life it was an active obedience. Do you remember how Paul puts it
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.760]   in writing to the Galatians in the fourth chapter, verses four and five? "When the
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:02.480]   fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   that he might redeem them that are under the law." That is it. And this is how he did
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:18.280]   it. He rendered the law a perfect obedience. He kept it fully. He carried it out in every
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.360]   jot and tittle. He said he was going to do it. He says, you remember, in Matthew 5, 17,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.880]   "Think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets. I am come not to destroy,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.320]   but to fulfill. And as I say, not one jot nor one tittle shall in any wise pass until
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:44.680]   all is fulfilled." And he did so. He kept the law perfectly, completely. He came up
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.360]   to God's demand in the law.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:59.280]   Now then, this is how he saves us. We are in him. That is why I read the fifth chapter
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:06.000]   of Romans at the beginning. We were all in Adam. Adam was our representative. He was
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.720]   our federal head. When he fell, we all fell with him. We who are saved, Paul argues, are
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:24.600]   in Christ. As we were in Adam, we are in Christ. All that was true of Adam was true of us.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.400]   All that Adam did became true of us. All that is true of Christ is true of us, becomes true
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:37.480]   of us. All that Christ has done becomes true of us. And I am saved, therefore, in this
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.580]   way. When Christ honored and kept the law by his active obedience, he was not only doing
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:51.080]   it for himself, he was doing it for me. And therefore, I can say with the apostle Paul,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:57.680]   we are not under law but under grace. The Christian is no longer under the law in the
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.480]   sense that it is the keeping of the law that is going to save him. As far as he is concerned,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.160]   the law has been kept. It has been honored. It is imputed to him for righteousness. "God
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.960]   hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.840]   of God in him." Or take it again in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:26.560]   this mighty statement of it. "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:34.320]   the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:41.600]   sin in the flesh." Why? "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." That
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:49.520]   is it. In other words, it is this great doctrine of our being one with Christ, in Christ. And
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:56.640]   so you see the atonement works in that way. What he did actively is imputed to us. What
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:03.520]   he did passively is imputed to us. So that in Christ, believing in Christ, incorporated
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:14.920]   in him, we can face the law without any fear, without any tremor, without any quiver. Indeed,
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:20.200]   I am going so far as to say this, that unless we are able to say that there is something
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:29.440]   wrong with our faith, we are no longer under the law, we are under grace. So we all ought
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:40.440]   to be ready to say with Augustus, "Stop, lady. The terrors of law and of God with me
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:54.240]   can have nothing to do. My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:02.160]   you." What a glorious statement. I am ashamed to think it is not in this hymn book of ours.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.360]   And do you know, my friends, it is rather a sad and pathetic observation to have to
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:12.120]   make. But I suggest that you look through these sections on the death of Christ in this
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.720]   hymn book and in most others, and I think you will agree with me when you have done
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:23.320]   so that they are very inadequate. How few of them state these magnificent doctrines
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.040]   as they are stated in the Scriptures. But Toplady has stated it there. It is the hymn
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:35.600]   which begins, "A debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy I sing, nor fear with thy
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:45.840]   righteousness on my person and offering to bring." The terrors of law and of God with
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:54.040]   me, says a man who is a sinner, but he must say it, and we must say it, with me can have
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   nothing to do. Why? My Savior's obedience active and blood passive. My Savior's obedience
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:16.080]   and blood. Hide all my transgressions from thee.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:22.160]   Very well, when we go on and when eventually we come to consider the doctrine of justification,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.320]   I will have to come back to this and we will see more fully what it means. But as regards
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:37.000]   the atonement, it means that I am fully atoned for and thus covered because my sins are blotted
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.640]   out and because I have the righteousness of Christ. It is what has happened in him, the
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:49.560]   person of Christ, the work of Christ. God willing, next Friday I hope to go on to
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:59.640]   consider some of the results and consequences of this perfect work of our Lord on our behalf.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:04.560]   And it is a greater subject than we sometimes think. God willing, we will go on to do that
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   next Friday. Let us pray.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:19.420]   Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, again we are conscious of the total inadequacy of anything
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:25.760]   that we can attempt to say. But O God, thou knowest us and thou knowest our minds and
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:33.840]   thou knowest our hearts. We do indeed desire to say together, "Praise my soul, the King
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:42.960]   of heaven, to his feet thy tribute bring, ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven. Who
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:54.080]   like thee, who his praise should sing, praise him, praise him, praise the everlasting King.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:03.480]   O God, accept our praise. And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:16.420]   us now this night and evermore. Amen.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.520]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
