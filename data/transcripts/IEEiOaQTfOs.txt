[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.120]   - Well, on Monday, we started the week
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   by looking at the cross.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.260]   It's always a great way to start the week, right?
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.400]   By looking at the cross.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.960]   And we saw there that the manner of Christ's death
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880]   was fitting.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.620]   It was fitting.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.040]   In that episode in APJ 1816,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.800]   Pastor John told us to underline
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.260]   and draw a big red circle around that word fitting
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.200]   in Hebrews 2.10, where it says,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.960]   "For it was fitting that he for whom
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.900]   "and by whom all things exist
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.540]   "in bringing many sons to glory
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.840]   "should make the founder of their salvation perfect
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.560]   "through suffering."
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.480]   The fittingness of Christ's public humiliation on the cross
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.520]   is a profound point worthy of much study
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.560]   and hours of meditation, Pastor John said to us last time,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.500]   because, quote, "God's eternal decision
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.440]   "to achieve our salvation through the sufferings of Christ
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.580]   "is not arbitrary or whimsical or meaningless,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.760]   "but is owing to a profound fitness and suitableness,"
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.600]   end quote.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.920]   And this fittingness of the cross
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.280]   calls for intense focus from us.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.840]   And we focus on the cross to resist
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800]   drifting away from the gospel.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.760]   That's a major theme in the book of Hebrews.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.940]   And I wanted to connect Monday's episode
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.320]   with today's sermon clip.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320]   And we do that with Hebrews 2.10.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.880]   Here's Pastor John preaching on this text in 1996,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.300]   talking about gospel drift and how to avoid it.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.620]   Here he is.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.540]   - Now, the reason I call him a forerunner,
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.460]   or in your bullet, I call him a captain,
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.300]   that's what one of the versions say,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.380]   is because of the phrase in verse 10,
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.140]   leading many sons to glory.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.900]   Let's read verse 10.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.700]   For it was fitting for him, God the Father,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.220]   for whom and through whom are all things,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.780]   in bringing many sons to glory.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.460]   That's what he was doing in sending Jesus,
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.240]   to suffer, die, and be glorified.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560]   He was leading, bringing many sons to glory.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.760]   It was fitting in doing that
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720]   to perfect the author of their salvation
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   through sufferings.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.360]   Now, there are a lot of important things in that verse.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.480]   That verse could keep us for months.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   What an amazing, rich verse, verse 10 is.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   But what I wanna focus on right away
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   is this phrase, God is bringing many sons to glory.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   The reason that's important is because it connects
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.160]   way back up with verse seven, where he quotes Psalm 8
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.400]   to say that the destiny of human beings is glory,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.000]   honor, dominion over the creation under God
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.760]   alongside Jesus Christ.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.360]   That's your destiny.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.840]   That's your goal.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.560]   Now, we don't yet see that, the case.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   Human beings suffer, they die.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.240]   But what we do see is Jesus made a human for a little while,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.800]   breaking into death, out of death,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.160]   seated on a glorious throne
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.760]   where we will one day join him unspeakably,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120]   according to Revelation 3, on his throne.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.200]   And in doing that, what is he doing?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.920]   Verse 10, he is leading or bringing
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.800]   many sons with him to glory.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.440]   So the reason the son assumed human flesh
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   is so that Psalm 8, which seemed to be aborting,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.200]   would be fulfilled in the first man out of the grave
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   and he would bring others with him.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.540]   That's the flow.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.560]   That's what's going on here.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200]   This is our great salvation.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   When he says in verse three,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.160]   beware lest you neglect your great salvation,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.280]   this is what he has in mind.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.320]   This great coming of the son into humanity,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   breaking through death, going into the Father's presence,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   being crowned with glory and honor,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.240]   and bringing with him many sons and daughters to glory
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.020]   so that Psalm 8 will have a fulfillment.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.860]   It will be fulfilled.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.580]   It is a great salvation for several reasons.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.420]   We've seen them.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.940]   It's great because there's a great destiny.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.100]   There will be no more cancer.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.160]   There will be no more paralysis.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.000]   There will be no more blindness.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.960]   There will be no more arthritis.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.240]   There will be no more heart disease.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.260]   There will be no more depression.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.320]   There will be no more violence or conflict anymore
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.440]   for the former things will have passed away.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.400]   Psalm 8 will be fulfilled.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160]   The glory that Jesus now enjoys at his Father's right hand
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.440]   will become our glory as well,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   and there will be a new heavens and a new earth,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   and Psalm 8 will be true as you and I vice versa.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.980]   Christ, regents, as it were, rule the universe
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.260]   alongside our older brother, Jesus Christ.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.460]   That's coming.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.620]   That is our great salvation,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.780]   and it's a great salvation, secondly,
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.960]   not just because of our goal, our destiny,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   but because of our Savior.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.660]   He is a great Savior.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.580]   His glory is our ultimate destiny.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.220]   We share in the glory that he has won
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.560]   by his death and resurrection,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.100]   and he was the Son of God coming to rescue us.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.620]   No mere human could have done what Jesus Christ did,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.700]   so our salvation is great because he's a forerunner,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.100]   God, and his goal is the glory of God.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.460]   Therefore, verse 3,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.220]   therefore, we're always coming back to the therefores.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.260]   Don't neglect this great salvation.
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.620]   Don't neglect it.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.060]   One of the great reasons for weakness
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   in the American evangelical mainline churches
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.260]   is neglect of the greatness of our salvation.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.900]   Ask yourself, how much mental energy
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.580]   do you expend to occupy yourself
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.000]   with the greatness of your salvation?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   Compared to the energy you expend on, say, your finances
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.700]   or housing or job,
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.900]   there is a colossal neglect
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.940]   of the greatness of our salvation in the church,
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.780]   not to mention outside the church.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.100]   Well, what would be the opposite of neglect?
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   Let me list off for you answers from the book of Hebrews.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.820]   In chapter 2, verse 1,
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.900]   it is paying close attention to what we've heard.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.260]   In chapter 3, verse 1,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.580]   it is consider Jesus the apostle
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.260]   and high priest of your confession.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.620]   In chapter 3, verse 12,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.260]   it is take care lest there should be in any of you
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.700]   an evil, unbelieving heart,
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.540]   but exhort one another every day.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.340]   In chapter 4, verse 16,
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.620]   it is drawing near to the throne of grace
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.420]   to get help from Jesus.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.860]   In chapter 10, verse 23,
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.020]   it is holding fast our confession without wavering.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.620]   In chapter 12, verse 1,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.140]   it is running the race that is set before us,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.980]   looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our salvation.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.700]   And in chapter 12, verse 25,
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.540]   it is not refusing him who speaks from heaven.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   Not neglecting is the mental, spiritual,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.100]   emotional engagement with God to behold,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.540]   to taste, to see, to embrace him in his greatness
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.060]   and all that he wrought for us.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.780]   To ponder it, to think on it and not neglect it.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.660]   My dad and I were coin collectors when I was growing up.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.460]   There was a series, a sequence of years.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.260]   I can't remember the exact age.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.660]   We were coin collectors.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.300]   I wonder how many have ever been coin collectors.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.020]   I haven't looked at the books for a long time,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.940]   but there used to be these fold open blue books,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.980]   little holes, dates, place of minting, push the coin in.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.100]   If you get a book full, you got a big deal.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.260]   Hundreds of dollars it's probably worth.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.420]   So my dad is a traveling evangelist.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.820]   He'd go away and he'd talk to coin collectors
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.420]   and he'd save all his coins and he'd bring them home
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.180]   and he and I would sit down together and look at them.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.900]   And we'd look them up in the book and see,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.940]   is this good, excellent, or is this fair?
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.940]   And we'd push them in the book and we'd try to finish books.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.020]   And then something happened.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.540]   I cannot tell you what happened.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.500]   We just started to not do it.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:40.380]   And there were a few spurts in the years after that
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.180]   of interest and we'd go down in the bottom shelf
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.900]   where it has a little door and we'd push the door
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.740]   and there they were.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.340]   We'd pull one out and do it a little bit
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.460]   and put it back and longer months would pass.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.420]   And today, I don't have a clue where those books are
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.900]   and they're worth thousands of dollars.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.260]   And that's the way many people
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.060]   experience the Christian faith.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.540]   There's this spurt, there's this engagement,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.940]   there's this flowering of apparent zeal and interest.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.940]   And then weeks pass and no prayer,
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.020]   no meditation on the Word.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.860]   It's easy to skip worship.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.540]   The late home really needs some attention
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.460]   and there's good fellowship there
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.100]   and the glory of God is proclaimed in the sunshine.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.580]   And little by little, you wake up one day
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.140]   and it's over, it's over.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.860]   It's not only neglected, it's forgotten and you're cold
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.740]   and there may be no return according to Hebrews 12, maybe.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:03.020]   And that's what this book is written to help not happen.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.100]   That's the point of the book of Hebrews.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.660]   Don't neglect it, don't neglect it.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.940]   It is a great salvation.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.860]   It's 10,000 times more great
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.620]   than dozens of full blue coin books
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.300]   but this salvation is worth 10,000 times more than that.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.660]   And this author is pleading with us,
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.620]   don't neglect a great salvation.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.460]   He writes this book to model for us
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.620]   and to help us copy him in meditating
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.300]   on the greatness of salvation.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.540]   If you say, what is the book of Hebrews?
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.140]   The book of Hebrews is one extended effort
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.100]   not to neglect the greatness of salvation.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.620]   It is one long meditation on the magnificence
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.380]   of Jesus Christ and what he has wrought
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.540]   through his death and resurrection for you and me.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.460]   So if you wanna know how do you not neglect
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.940]   your great salvation, let the book of Hebrews model for you
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.540]   how not to neglect your great salvation.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.180]   That's what he's doing here.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.100]   - So good, that coin collecting story.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   I'd never heard that before.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.780]   It's a good one, motivating one
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.620]   to warn us against the dangers of gospel drift.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.060]   This clip was taken from a sermon on Hebrews chapter two
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.060]   titled, "Our Captain Made Perfect Through Sufferings"
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.420]   preached on June 2, 1996.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.580]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.860]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.900]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.260]   Make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.020]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.140]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.820]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.300]   Well, what if the Bible warns us
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.540]   not to become overly righteous, overly righteous?
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.740]   Is that what the Bible says, to avoid being too righteous?
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.620]   Yes, it does.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.500]   Right there in Ecclesiastes 7.16.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.380]   You can look it up for yourself, no joke.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.900]   Don't be too righteous.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.180]   So what on earth does that mean?
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.380]   It's a great Bible question and as of next time,
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.220]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.060]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.960]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
