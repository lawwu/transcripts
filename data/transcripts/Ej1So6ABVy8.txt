[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.820]   - Curious what made quitting such a hard decision?
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.640]   What characterized it so differently
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.640]   that it was worth the kind of followup to dig into?
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.180]   - Basically, here's the deal.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.600]   What allows us to make decisions under uncertainty
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720]   is that we have the option to quit.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.160]   Okay, so just basic, right?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.480]   Imagine if when you hired someone
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.960]   you could never fire them.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.520]   How hard of a decision that would be.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.880]   Imagine if as soon as you went on a date with somebody
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.280]   you had to marry them.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.000]   How hard would it be to choose somebody
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.320]   to go on a date with, right?
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.680]   Imagine if you rented an apartment,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.080]   you couldn't get out of the lease, like ever.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   Like these things would become very difficult, right?
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.320]   So decision-making under uncertainty is really hard,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   but what allows us to be able to do it,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.240]   to be able to choose things when we know so little
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.400]   is that when we find out new stuff,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   whether it's about the world
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.200]   or it's about our own preferences,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.220]   oh, it turns out I don't like this neighborhood,
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.820]   whatever, that we can quit.
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.800]   Okay, so it's a really, really, really important decision.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.560]   It's having this option to quit is incredibly valuable.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.120]   But what's interesting is that what the science tells us
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.960]   is that we're really bad at it.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.720]   So, you know, there's a lot,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.000]   obviously grit is a really, really popular concept.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.880]   People think about grit as character building,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.640]   in fact, as almost synonymous with character.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.280]   And it's true that grit's really important
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.600]   for getting you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500]   That's incredibly important, right?
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.360]   We have to not quit things just 'cause they're hard.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.560]   Otherwise we won't ever be successful at anything
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   'cause anything worth doing
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.540]   is gonna be hard at some point, okay?
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.440]   So that's for sure true.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.280]   And I think everybody should read "Grit"
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.540]   and it's a great book and Angela Duckworth is brilliant.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.180]   But I was missing the other side of the conversation,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.880]   which is that grit also gets you to stick to hard things
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.220]   that are not worthwhile.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.480]   And that's a really huge problem.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.800]   Grit, we can't think about grit as a virtue
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.680]   and quitting as a vice or a character flaw, right?
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.140]   Because there's, I can show you lots of circumstances
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.420]   where grit is a character flaw.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320]   Where sticking to something too long is bad.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640]   Like Muhammad Ali boxing for years
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   after he already had symptoms of Parkinson.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.880]   You know, when he was really suffering physically,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.720]   he should have walked away from the game.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   So we know that it's very context dependent, right?
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.040]   And sometimes quitting is the best thing
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   that you can ever do.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   Like if you're in a job with a toxic boss
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.360]   or you're in a toxic relationship
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.320]   or you're at the top of Everest
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.840]   and it's past the turnaround time
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.720]   and there's a snowstorm coming in.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.160]   Clearly sticking to it is dumb in that situation, right?
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880]   So we need to realize that they're the same decision
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   and one is not good and one is not bad.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   It's very dependent on context.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.800]   And then when you start to look and dive
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.520]   into the scientific literature,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   it turns out that there's just tremendous,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.200]   just a tremendous cognitive forces
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.780]   that make it very hard for us to walk away from things.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.740]   Not at the right time anyway.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.960]   All the way from sunk costs,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.160]   which we've talked about a little,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.180]   which is this tendency to stick to things
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.600]   because you're worried you'll have wasted the time
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.840]   or the money or whatever that you put into it
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.400]   because you wanna get that back.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   Somehow like when you hold onto a stock
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.760]   or you stay in a job or whatever,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.880]   there's issues that have to do
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.760]   with endowment ownership over things.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.160]   We value the things that we own
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.280]   more than the things that we don't,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.040]   including our beliefs, by the way.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.600]   And we don't like to let go of those things
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   that have to do with something called sure loss aversion,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.960]   which Daniel Kahneman talks about,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.680]   which is, as we just said,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.560]   like you have a loss on the books.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.880]   If you quit, it turns it,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.400]   I'm sorry, you have a loss on paper rather.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.600]   If you quit, it turns into a realized loss.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.120]   We don't like that.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   That doesn't feel good to us.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   So, as Richard Thaler says,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.880]   like we don't like to close mental accounts in the losses.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.960]   So like, we don't like to close those accounts
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.680]   and sort of eat that loss.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   Even though, obviously just like a stock portfolio,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.280]   our decisions are a portfolio,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.480]   our opportunities are a portfolio,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.200]   and we ought to be trying to spend our time
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.840]   on the ones that are going to move us toward our goals
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.440]   the most that are gonna cause us to gain the most ground.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.280]   We open an account for a particular thing we're doing,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   whether it's a marathon or climbing Everest
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   or a job or relationship or whatever.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   And we don't think about that time, that effort,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.760]   that all of that is fungible
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.560]   across all the possible opportunities we have.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.280]   Instead, we just think if I quit now,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.600]   I won't have hit my goal.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.040]   And then I'm gonna be a failure and I'm gonna have lost.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.440]   And so we won't quit.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.480]   There's identity, cognitive dissonance, status quo bias.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.000]   These are all in the book, omission, commission bias.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.680]   It's like, there's so much stuff
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480]   that we just carry around with us,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.800]   this cognitive debris that makes it really hard
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.520]   for us to walk away.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.240]   And here's the thing that why I'm so passionate
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.520]   about this topic is that we think
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   that quitting will slow our progress down.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.220]   We think it may actually cause us to lose ground,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.280]   but that's not true.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   When you quit at the right time,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.920]   it actually gets you to where you want to go faster
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.840]   because it stops you from sticking to something
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.080]   that isn't actually causing you to get there,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.360]   to gain ground toward your goal
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   and allows you to switch to something
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.480]   that will allow you to gain ground toward your goal.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   And that's the thing that we miss
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.680]   because we don't see the other opportunities
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   that the thing we're doing is stopping us from engaging in
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   because there's a cost to that time.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.520]   There's a cost to that money that we're spending
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.560]   on whatever it is that we're into
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.760]   or that we're pursuing, the path that we're on.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.560]   And we won't let go of it
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.040]   because if we haven't reached our goal,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.320]   we think we're a failure.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   But just like if you sell that stock at 30
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.920]   and you take the $20, you know, whatever,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   you lost the $20, so what?
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   You can put that $30 into other investments
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.360]   that are actually gonna get you
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.680]   to financial wellbeing more quickly.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.880]   So holding on to a stock that isn't worthwhile
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.440]   because you already lost $20 in it
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.680]   is actually slowing your progress down
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.360]   because you can't go put those resources
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.400]   into something that will get you
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.320]   to financial wellbeing more quickly.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.360]   And that's true whether it's a stock or a job
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.600]   or a relationship or a race you're running.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.520]   I don't really care.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.360]   If the world tells you you should quit, you ought to do that
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.960]   because that's the thing that allows us
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.920]   to decide under uncertainty in the first place.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.520]   So let's start exercising that option
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.860]   so that we can more efficiently and more quickly
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.580]   get to where we wanna go.
