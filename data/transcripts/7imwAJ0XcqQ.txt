[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:20.960]   All right, everybody, welcome to Episode 151 of the all in
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.560]   podcast with me again today. The Sultan of science, the Queen of
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.440]   Kenwa, the Prince of panic attacks, David Friedberg, the
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.600]   dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, and your crazy
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.520]   angry history uncle David Sachs is here. Welcome to the program,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.040]   everybody. We got a very full docket. I guess we'll start it
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.560]   off with how the war and the conflict in the Middle East is
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.280]   going here. Sachs you hosted a Twitter space with the vague
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.040]   and Elon on preventing World War Three. What was the premise
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   and the reason for setting up this trio to talk about World
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   War Three?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.480]   Well, I think Vivek actually had the idea to do it. We had a
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   couple other folks on the panel as well. We had Colonel Daniel
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.320]   Davis, who has a podcast called deep dive. He's a military
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.400]   expert. We had Alexander Mercurius from the Duran, which
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.320]   is a top geopolitics podcast. And so we were talking about the
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   risk of a series of chain reactions that could happen in
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360]   the next few weeks here over what's happening in the Middle
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.760]   East, Elon wanted to do it, because of what he said, which
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.640]   is that he's talking to a lot of world leaders, he's talking to a
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.880]   lot of different people. And they tell him that the risk of
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.240]   some major war happening or some greater catastrophe is higher
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   than they've ever seen. So he was quite concerned about that.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.440]   And, you know, I think a few things came out of it. The first
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.200]   is, and I think Elon took this position most strongly, we
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.960]   really need to end the war in Ukraine, the combination of
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.680]   having a war in Ukraine, that involves the United States, and
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   then a war in the Middle East that could also involve the
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.200]   United States and Russia has troops in Syria, there's a lot
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.680]   of ways for this to spiral out of control, there's a lot of
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.720]   room for unintended consequences. His view was,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.640]   look, we've just had five months of counter offensive here, it
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.680]   didn't go anywhere. On net, the Ukrainians didn't take back any
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.200]   territory. In fact, the Russians slightly gained territory. So
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.080]   this war is going nowhere. It has failed, it is time for the
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.040]   administration to work towards a ceasefire and a resolution.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.000]   Because having
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   all the Ukrainians have not
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.600]   they had a completely failed counter offensive.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.400]   Okay, but you said the worst found. So I'm just curious,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.320]   which the counter offensive has failed.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.280]   Okay, got it.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.880]   We're now the counter offensive started on June 4, or fifth.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.240]   It's now October 26. And if you look at the map that the New
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.400]   York Times provided, Ukraine has not taken back any meaningful
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.040]   amount of territory. In fact, Russia on net has gained
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.880]   territory, even when it was supposed to be Ukraine on
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.240]   offense. So there is no prospect of Ukraine achieving its
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.960]   objective of evicting Russia from their territory. So what is
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.280]   the point of
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320]   have defended themselves from an invasion from Putin? Yeah. You
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.800]   would say that they've ended up six hundreds. What's successful
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.880]   about it? Several hundred thousand didn't get taken over
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.360]   as a country when they were in. That was that was Russia's goal.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.440]   Okay. So when they sent the troops in there, their goal
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.160]   wasn't to invade. What was our goal, then? Honestly, you don't
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   really understand the history of the conflict.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.920]   No, no, I mean, we've we've talked about his problem. I'm
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.280]   just saying the way you're framing it is that Ukraine
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.720]   found it seems to me they've also the argument could be that
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.120]   they defended themselves successfully.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.440]   If you look at what's happened this year. So let's just put a
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   pin and what happened last year, because I think there's
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   different ways of interpreting it. But if you look at what's
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.080]   happened this year, and certainly over the last five
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.840]   months, Ukraine has made no progress in evicting the
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.960]   Russians, nor is there any prospect of them evicting the
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.920]   Russians. So the continuation of that war doesn't achieve
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.200]   anything except kill the flower of Ukrainian youth, and
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.800]   continue to use the Ukrainians are dying in much higher
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.160]   numbers. And Russia is a much bigger country. They've got
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.600]   something like five times the population. So moreover, with
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.920]   this new conflict in the Middle East, you create all these
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   unintended consequences and all this risk of escalation, being
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.080]   in a proxy war with Russia. So that was the first thing to come
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.680]   out of the Twitter space was a consensus among the people who
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.040]   were there that it's time to resolve this conflict with
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.320]   Russia, the United States is not need to be in a proxy war with
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   Russia, we need to normalize relations, it's way too
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.840]   dangerous to be continuing this with what's going on in the
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.800]   Middle East. The second half of the the Twitter space, I think
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.280]   was about the scenarios here for what could come in the Middle
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.720]   East. And just briefly, I think that there's three scenarios
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.040]   here for what could happen, assuming Israel goes into Gaza,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.800]   this is what everyone's waiting for is will there be a ground
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   invasion of Gaza Netanyahu says they're going to do it. The
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   theory on why they haven't right now is the US is actually moving
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   a bunch of assets into military assets into place, they're
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.400]   putting air defense batteries around military bases in the
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.200]   Middle East. So there's been a lot of reporting that the US has
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.000]   told Israel to wait until the US military is ready for any
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   blowback that could happen. But Netanyahu has been very clear
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.880]   that they are going in no matter what anybody else says. Three
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.840]   scenarios could arise from that number one is what Israel and I
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.600]   think the administration want, which is that they have a
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.040]   successful military operation and the US is threats deter
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.680]   Hezbollah or Iran from getting in. So that would be like
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.360]   scenario number one. Scenario number two would be that the
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.080]   Israelis go in, it's guerrilla fighting, it's much tougher than
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   anybody expects, they start to take casualties. At the same
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.520]   time, you get massive public uproar, you get a lot of
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.040]   protests, the Arab street erupts, more and more leaders
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.440]   across the world denounce Israel. And so you kind of muddle
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.280]   your way eventually towards a ceasefire in a couple of months.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.520]   So that would be scenario number two. Scenario number three is
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.180]   that this thing spirals out of control very quickly where you
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.640]   get Hezbollah in the north invade. So you have a second
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.040]   front, the West Bank could erupt in protests that could
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.680]   potentially create a third front. Iran could get involved
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.360]   either because they feel the need to defend Hezbollah or
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.000]   because you have people like Lindsey Graham are basically
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.640]   already calling for war with Iran. So either side could
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.360]   basically escalate into that. So
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.680]   I think what happened with Lindsey Graham, because he was
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.760]   telling them if Iran if they got involved, that we would strike
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.240]   back. Yeah, yeah. But I wasn't saying invade.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.080]   I think he's saying pretty clearly that if Hezbollah gets
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   involved, we're blaming Iran for that. Got it. Okay. So he's
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.480]   chomping at the bit to basically invade Iran. Now, how could
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.920]   that happen? Well, you're saying you think he's chopping at the
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.320]   bit to invade Iran? Oh, yeah, he just he gave them the warning to
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.800]   not this about the neocon. I'm curious about that point. Yeah.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.560]   Explain that piece. This has been on the neocon agenda for a
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   long time. They wanted to have a war with Iran, they basically
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.560]   see the Iranian regime as an enemy, and they want to knock it
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.800]   off. Even if you go back to 2003, the beginning of the Iraq
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.400]   War, there was serious conversation about whether Iraq
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.680]   was the right country to invade. A lot of people thought that we
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.440]   should go after Iran, not Iraq. And the Bush administration's
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.720]   view on that was, don't worry, we're gonna get them all. The
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.840]   question is, which one to do first, we're going to knock off
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.440]   Saddam first. In fact, what's going to happen is we're gonna
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.920]   be greeted as liberators. The invasion is gonna be so
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   successful, that the rest of these tyrannical Middle Eastern
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.040]   regimes are just going to throw up their arms. And they're
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.280]   going to basically, you know, surrender and become
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   democracies that this was the Bush administration's claim back
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.240]   in 2003, obviously didn't work out like that. But there has
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.700]   been a desire to go into a lot of these countries for a long
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.280]   time. And I think there are a lot of these neocons who see
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.820]   Iran is unfinished business. And if they get the chance to do
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.400]   that, they will.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.960]   So yeah, that and see, that's the piece of your analysis there
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.860]   that I thought was most interesting. You think Lindsey
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.000]   Graham wants to invade Iran. So when he gave that warning in his
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.920]   speech, which I think came out today, or did it come out
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.720]   yesterday? You think when he gave him the warning, hey, don't
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   get involved, or that's going to be the third front, you'd
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.300]   actually think it's he wants to invade. The United States has
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.040]   that agenda.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.760]   I think there's a lot of neocons who have that agenda. And you
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.840]   see this in the Wall Street Journal, which is sort of the
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.560]   lead leading neocon publication.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.080]   Got it. Okay, so let's explain what the Wall Street Journal
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.200]   obviously, has been talking about Hamas militants being
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.560]   trained in Iran a few weeks before the 1070 tax. And it says
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   about 500 militants from Hamas
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.520]   even when 10 seven happened, remember, there was that Wall
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.240]   Street Journal story claiming that Iran had directed the whole
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.640]   thing. Yeah. And then that was knocked down by Israeli
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.880]   officials who said we haven't seen evidence of that as well as
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.040]   Washington officials, you know, kind of the usual unnamed, knock
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.440]   that down. So the Wall Street Journal has been kind of pushing
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   the the edge here trying to I'd say, rattle the saber and gin
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   up some sort of action against Iran. The latest thing was a
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.880]   story claiming that 500 militants had just been trained
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.440]   by Iran. So they keep trying to put this idea in play that we
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.560]   need a war against Iran is my point.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.680]   Okay, so just let me reflect that back to you're saying
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.560]   Lindsey Graham wants to invade Iran, and he's part of the
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.680]   neocon agenda. And the Wall Street Journal is not just
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.760]   straight reporting this, the Wall Street Journal is in trying
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.720]   to incite an incident here and start a war with Iran.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.880]   Well, the Wall Street Journal reflects the agenda of the
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.680]   people who own it, and then the people who are their sources.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.360]   And clearly, somebody is leaking the stories to the journal,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.080]   somebody leaked the idea on day one of this crisis that Iran was
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.080]   secretly directing the whole thing, even though Israel itself
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.280]   said that was not true. So yeah, look, they have an agenda. They
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.920]   have an agenda.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.120]   So the Wall Street Journal's agenda is to sabre rattle and
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   incite a global war with Iran. Or are you saying that they're
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.360]   just useful idiots and that they're being manipulated by the
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.600]   military global complex and the neocons?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.160]   I'm just saying,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.400]   you said the Wall Street Journal sabre rattling. So that's as if
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.640]   the Wall Street Journal wants to start a conflict.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.000]   The Wall Street Journal is beating the drums of war.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   That's what's going on.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.360]   Okay, so you believe the journalists at the Wall Street
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.160]   Journal are trying to start a war with Iran.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.520]   They are beating the drums of war.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.800]   That's what drums of war means to you. Okay. Chamath. Friberg,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   you think that the Wall Street Journal here is trying to start
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.600]   a war with Iran?
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   I'll give you a little bit of history here. I'm going to
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.320]   presume you know, it's it'll be repetitive. But it used to be
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.480]   that Iran was a bastion of economic growth and cultural
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.600]   vitality, right. But if you go even further back, there was a
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.040]   duly elected Prime Minister that was overthrown Muhammad Mossadegh.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.360]   Because he tried to nationalize the oil industry in the 50s in
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   Iran, and that coup d'etat, which was run by the army, was
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.800]   sponsored by the UK and US government. So we've had a long
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.040]   kind of sordid history with Iran for a very long time post World
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.400]   War Two. A lot of it has been intertwined with petrodollars and
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.320]   oil. So you know, we had the Shah, then there was this duly
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.560]   elected Prime Minister, he tried to nationalize the oil
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.840]   industry. He was overthrown in a coup d'etat supported by America
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.280]   and Britain, they brought back the foreign oil companies,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.440]   including American oil companies. Then the Shah ran for
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.240]   30 years, but then he was overthrown for a whole bunch of
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.280]   cultural issues. And so it's gone back and forth and back and
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.680]   forth. So I think it's important to keep in mind that a lot of
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.040]   that generation, it's not clear to me where their views come
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.920]   from. And what I mean by that generation is folks of Lindsey
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.840]   Graham's generation and older have this multi layered view of
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.760]   Iran, because they've seen two or three of these regime changes,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.440]   and they've seen the changing incentives that America has had
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.040]   towards dealing with them. So instead of just kind of kind of
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.320]   putting it out there, like we just want to go to war, I think
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.920]   it's important to remember that these guys have a historical
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.360]   context that younger folks may not. Okay, that's number one.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.720]   Number two, I think it's David is right, that there are certain
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.000]   publications that are beating the drums of war, the first time
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   that the Wall Street Journal did it, it was that Iran was the one
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   that essentially was the trigger puller on the October 7 attacks.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.960]   And that was immediately refuted. Interestingly, not by
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.040]   Iran, which did it later, but actually by the United States in
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.880]   Israel. So I do think that there is some questionable incentives
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.120]   that drove the publication of that article at a very critical
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.160]   point at the beginning of this Israel, Hamas, Gaza,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.960]   you're an idea of what that incentive would be.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.280]   No, I don't I don't know, except to say that the facts are that
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.440]   there was an article that pointed the finger. It was
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.840]   written as an exclusive, it was written in a moment where things
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.280]   were very heightened, and little was known. And that these
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.040]   governments had to come out and explicitly disavow and de
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.600]   escalate it. And so I think that's just an important thing
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.200]   to observe. Now we're in this second wave, where there's a
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.520]   second attempt to now point the finger directly back to Iran as
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.760]   having trained these Hamas terrorists, as now engaging in
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.280]   and it's not to say that they're not. But it's just that this
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   escalation is definitely happening on a continuous basis.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   And so it's important to, frankly, understand the
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.520]   historical context and de escalate so that we don't I
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.480]   think Ilan is right, this is how you sleepwalk into war is you
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:11.320]   read a headline, you believe it, and then you run with it. And
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.800]   the opposite of sleepwalking is underwriting from first
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.200]   principles, I think it's important to go and read the
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.960]   historical context of how we've been engaged in Iran since World
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.920]   War Two, particularly the back and forth, the complicated issue
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.760]   of all the petro dollars. And then you can view Lindsey
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.200]   Graham's comments in two veins, I think vein number one is he
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.080]   was there with a bipartisan delegation of I think it was 10
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.880]   US senators and five of each five Republicans, five
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.080]   Democrats. So I think it's fair to say that he is not just
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.960]   speaking off the top of his head. I think that there's some
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.720]   understanding of what he intended to say. And so I do
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.000]   think that this is sort of a back channel way of getting on
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.080]   the record that they really need to de escalate. If they are given
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.800]   an opportunity to engage, they should not. I think that's the
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.360]   way you say you're talking about Iran. Yeah, Iran should be
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.720]   escalated. And frankly, hopefully they listen and they
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   do and they do it. Lindsey Graham's quote, just to put it
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   out there. When he was visiting Tel Aviv. We're here today to
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.960]   tell Iran, we're watching you if this war grows, it's coming to
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.040]   your backyard. The idea that this happened without Iranian
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.960]   involvement is laughable. Freeberg, what are your thoughts?
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.640]   Do you think the journalists at the Wall Street Journal are
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.280]   complicit in trying to incite something here? Do you think
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.240]   they're just reporting the facts straight? What's your take on
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.600]   this?
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.080]   Can I answer that? Because I actually have a data point.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.920]   Yeah, no, I mean, and the reason I'm pushing you on it sacks,
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.520]   you're using the language of conspiracy, like complicit, to
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.720]   make it sound like I'm leveling an accusation at them when what
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.080]   I'm saying is, this is their editorial policy. And you can
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.680]   see that by actually reading their editorial. So therefore,
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.080]   look at an op ed that came from their editorial board two days
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.720]   ago, called Biden's redline moment with Iran. And what it
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.840]   says is here that Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.920]   Tuesday, that the US would respond swiftly and decisively
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.360]   to any attack on American forces from Iran or its proxies. And
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.840]   then it says, that's a welcome message aimed at deterring the
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.760]   mullahs in Tehran and their agents. But will the President
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   enforce the redline he appears to be drawn? He hasn't so far.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.320]   So in other words, the journal editorial board is saying that
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.120]   Biden has not been tough enough on Iran. Okay, now go to the
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.280]   last paragraph. It also says here, Iran is using his proxies
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.400]   to test us resolve. The more they attack without Iran paying
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.320]   a price, the more likely that Iran will raise the stakes. The
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.800]   paradox Mr. Biden has to appreciate the most stabilizing
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.120]   move for the region would be restoring America as a deterrent
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.240]   power. So what does that mean? You take these things together,
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.000]   they're saying that in order to stabilize the region, we need to
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   deter Iran, but they say that just making threats of
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.120]   deterrence is not enough, you actually have to do something.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.400]   So in other words, like attacking Iran is the
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   stabilizing move, which is war is peace. It's right out of
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.160]   George Orwell. So this is what I mean beating the drums. And by
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.880]   the way, the reason I'm not saying you're conspiracy,
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   there's your there are there is editorials, then there's news,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.520]   and then there's your imprecise language that I'm just
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.200]   challenging you on because I want you to be precise here. If
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.960]   you're saying the journalists are trying to provoke a war here,
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.600]   or, you know, in the banging the drum and saber rattling, I'm
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.520]   not sounds like I think you're well, saber rattling and banging
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   the drums are a bit imprecise.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.120]   You're going down a weird rabbit hole of what, what the Wall
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.160]   Street Journal believes, I think it's pretty clear that their
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.520]   editorial policy is they are super hawkish on Iran, they
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.280]   don't think Biden's been tough enough on Iran. They also have
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.960]   published two stories that have been either knocked down or
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.360]   questioned since October 7, that clearly want to lay all the
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.960]   blame for this on Iran. And so they are ginning up both in
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.400]   their news and their editorial pages. They're beating the
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.840]   drums of war. They're trying to basically prime the
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.320]   administration to go to war.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.360]   Got it. They're trying to go the administration, but I don't
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.760]   think I don't understand why. Honestly, I feel like we're
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.160]   going down a rabbit hole. Look,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.480]   no, I'm just trying to understand your position. And
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.840]   if you're talking about the editorial page, you're talking
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.240]   about the reporting. That's all I'm trying to get you to be more
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.880]   precise. That's all.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.640]   I think both in this case, remember, if you go back to the
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.240]   reporting on the Ukraine war, and I followed a lot of it by
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.760]   all the major publications, in my opinion, the Wall Street
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.160]   Journal's news coverage of Ukraine was some of the most
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.560]   biased and inaccurate of any publication, any major Western
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   publication. And I'll just give you one example here. The
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.040]   Wall Street Journal, which is on August 31, the Wall Street
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.720]   Journal claimed that Ukraine had a major success in its
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.840]   counteroffensive, claiming that it had pierced the main Russian
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.600]   defensive line. Okay, we are now what is it? Basically, two
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   months since then. And it's very clear that that did not happen.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Okay, that was all nonsense. And again, read the first
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.160]   paragraphs here. Not only do they claim to penetrate the
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.160]   line, it said it raised hopes of a breakthrough that would
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   reinvigorate the slow moving counteroffensive. Was there a
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.560]   subsequent breakthrough? Did hopes get raised? No, this was
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.280]   total nonsense.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   So your position here is the journalists who wrote this
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:32.160]   story, are in some way, trying to benefit the neocons in the
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.000]   military industrial companies.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.880]   Wall Street Journal as a, you know, an active participant in
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.600]   the war, and as a reporter, it's just kind of an explosive. It's
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.760]   not kind of it is it's an explosive claim. And so I'm just
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.160]   trying to be
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.320]   really, I'm just saying that their reporting on Ukraine was
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.800]   highly inaccurate. And it was all inaccurate in the same way.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.680]   Which is it always overstated the Ukrainian successes in this
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   war. So I call that bias, I think it's easy to prove. I
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   think they have a similar bias, which is stated explicitly by
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.240]   the report, which is they don't think that Biden and DC has been
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.920]   hawkish enough on Iran. And they would like to see, they think
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.680]   the stabilizing move is for Biden to basically take action
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.360]   against Iran, whatever that means.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.560]   Yeah, okay. Freeberg, any thoughts on this one before we
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:33.040]   move on to the next up? Nothing on the war on the situation?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.400]   We can pivot off of that. Yeah, that's why I'm bringing him in.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.920]   I mean, I feel like we're debating the wrong thing, which
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.520]   is you're, you're actually questioning whether there are
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.280]   war drums beating for Iran, when I think it's like abundantly
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.800]   clear what we should be discussing is whether that's a
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.040]   wise move for the US.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.440]   I think it's clear that these drums are being beaten. I think
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.000]   the question is, why? Why would we allow that to be the default
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.760]   plan of action?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.200]   My concern, it's, everyone's gonna think it's crazy, but it's
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:14.360]   that there's a very, very low probability, but now probably
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.520]   much higher than it was, that the world marches towards using
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   a nuclear weapon for the first time in a long time. And the
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   reason is, as Saks has pointed out so many times, there's
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.080]   significant material and industrial production shortages,
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   not just in the US, but around the world to support rising
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.480]   conventional wars that seem to be scaling all over and there's
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.320]   going to be multiple fronts. And to feed those wars with
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.080]   conventional weaponry. There's, there's a breaking point, our
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.600]   cost of weaponry is 10x Russia's cost of weaponry, supposedly, I
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.760]   mean, I'm just quoting Saks on this point. But if all that is
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.400]   true, at some point, these conflicts become really
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.600]   difficult to maintain. And if we're in the midst of a
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.680]   conflict, you may not be able to simply retreat or recede. At
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.880]   some point, the question is, well, how do we gain superiority
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.560]   again? And whether that's us or Russia backed into a corner, or
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.680]   Israel backed into a corner who also has a nuclear arsenal,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   there's a couple of scenarios, there's like a million scenarios
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.440]   from here, there's a million realities we could live in from
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.520]   here from today. But there's some number of them that end up
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.880]   with someone saying, I got to press the button. And there's
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   remember, not all nuclear weapons are these things that
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.000]   wipe out a million people instantly, some of them are
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.960]   small, low tactical weapons, that is still very low
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.640]   probability, but much higher than it was a few weeks ago,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.320]   that we find ourselves walking, because of the fact that we're
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.680]   gonna have multiple conflicts and burn through all this
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.760]   conventional weaponry not have industrial production systems to
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.200]   support all these conflicts. But every bunch of countries that
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.600]   have a trump card, and once you start talking about it, it'll
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.200]   seem scary at first, then it'll get normalized. And then it'll
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.480]   become a question of when and where and how. And then all of
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.560]   a sudden, it's like, holy shit, this is a different world we're
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.440]   living in. That's a scary place I don't want to be in anything
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.480]   we can do to eliminate those paths from being walked. I'm in
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.960]   favor of even if that means seeding strategic advantages
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.480]   today, I just don't think that that's a place we want to go.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.680]   There's like, nine nuclear powers, who do you think is
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.440]   going to be the one who would actually use a nuclear bomb
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.280]   freeberg? I have some speculation there. You just
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.520]   think everybody runs out of bullets and tanks and missiles,
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.640]   and then they go to nuclear because they have nothing left.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.400]   I don't look, I tend to think in terms of like, there are
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.040]   multiple parallel scenarios that can play out. So I don't have a
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.160]   point if you're not going to say deterministically, I think this
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.920]   thing is going to happen. Again, I think this is very low
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.440]   probability. Sure, I could see a bunch of scenarios emerging,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.840]   like, let's say that Russia's got their back against the wall
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.680]   and Putin's feeling lost and desperate, and he needs to use a
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.560]   tactical weapon to, you know, get some regional victory. Again,
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.960]   these tactical nuclear weapons, they're not necessarily the
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.640]   kinds of things that you would use to level Manhattan. Those
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.480]   exist. But there are other weapons in the arsenal that I
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.000]   get worried that someone says, we're backed in a corner, we
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.360]   have nowhere else to go. We can't win this thing
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.120]   conventionally, and we cannot lose. And that's the moment when
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.000]   someone says this is the let's start talking about this. And
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.200]   that conversation happens before it gets used, then that
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.640]   conversation becomes normalized. And then suddenly, it's not this
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.880]   thing. We all grew up in a world where this was never a real
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.760]   threat or risk or conversation. There was the Cold War and the
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.080]   dismantling and we were kind of headed in a good direction for
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.840]   the last 40 some odd years. But now it's like, I don't see it
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.800]   going in that good direction anymore. So I'm just really
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.560]   nervous about that.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.560]   Yeah, I think you should be nervous about that. Let me give
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.720]   you a couple of examples. So first of all, I agree with
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.040]   freebirds point that humans who are convinced of the
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.120]   righteousness, their cause have a tremendous ability to wave
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.480]   away or justify any sort of tactical implications. So, for
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.120]   example, we did use two atomic bombs to end World War Two. That
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   wasn't the only time it was advocated. If you go back to I
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.920]   think it was around 1950. MacArthur wanted to win the
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:22.520]   Korean War by using 20 to 30 atomic bombs. And his plan was
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.360]   to so thoroughly irradiate the border between China and North
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.080]   Korea, that China would never be able to invade through invading
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.520]   army for something like 50 years. Truman had to fire him
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.960]   because Truman didn't agree with the strategy. And by the way,
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.600]   MacArthur was not some crazy, you know, he was not some like
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.400]   wacko. He was the most respected man in America in 1950. And
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.440]   Truman paid a huge political price for having to fire him. It
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.400]   was one of the reasons why Truman couldn't run for
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.920]   reelection again. So this idea that like rational people would
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.520]   never use these things not true. The generals in 1962, during the
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.920]   Cuban Missile Crisis, were all ready to take the nukes off the
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.040]   chain if the Soviets were willing to break the the naval
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.120]   blockade. So, you know, it's not just foreign powers who have
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   rattled the saber on nukes. We've done it at various points
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.360]   through our history to let me give you a more mundane example.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.040]   Just earlier this year, Biden said that we were out of 155
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.640]   millimeter artillery ammunition. And so we had to give Ukraine
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.840]   cluster bombs. Remember this, just a year before that same
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.120]   administration had said the use of cluster bombs was a war
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   crime. So in other words, they were able to change the morality
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.040]   on the use of cluster bombs because tactically they were out
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.520]   of the type of ammunition they want to use, they had nothing
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.240]   left. So, you know, I think this kind of reinforces freebirds
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.880]   point now, look at our inventory replacement times for key
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.080]   systems. This was a report by CSIS. That is a military think
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.960]   tank in Washington, what they show is that our industrial
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.080]   capacity is so hollowed out that it's going to take us five plus
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   years to replace our stockpiles of artillery ammunition of
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:16.480]   javelins of stingers of gimlers as another type of rocket system.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:22.240]   And so we are like dangerously low on key types of ammunition.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.200]   And yet, remember when 60 minutes to that interview with
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.040]   Biden, they said to him, well, gee, if we're in a war, both on
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.480]   behalf of Ukraine and behalf of Israel, doesn't that pose any
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.280]   trade offs? And by his response was no, we're the most powerful
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.440]   nation in the world. For good measure, he said, we're the most
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.320]   powerful nation in the history of the world. So he doesn't see
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.880]   any trade offs, he doesn't see any limits on American power.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.520]   Quite frankly, I think this is why he's dangerous is because he
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.080]   still thinks that the US is living in 1991. He's been in
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.840]   Washington for 50 years, and he only remembers the unipolar
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.200]   moment, all of his instincts and experience have been shaped by
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.160]   that period of time, when the US was the only superpower, that we
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.000]   were the global hegemon. We're no longer in that position
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.720]   anymore. You know, first of all, Russia and China are strong,
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.640]   they are great powers, too. And Iran is much stronger than Iraq.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.320]   Iran is four times the size of California and has roughly 90
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.600]   million people. And they got a lot of engineers. And even if we
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.680]   didn't want to attack them, it's not exactly clear how you would
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.920]   stage that attack. Just getting to Iran would require flying
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.360]   over some very dangerous territory. It's not clear we
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.840]   have the we have the bases or the air clearance rights from
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   allies to be able to even get to Iran. Moreover, Iran apparently
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.600]   has a very strong missile program. So they may even have
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.800]   the ability to fire missiles or hypersonic missiles that are
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   aircraft carriers that are sitting in the Mediterranean
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   Sea. So if we get in a war with Iran, it's no joke, this is not
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.480]   going to be shock and awe, this could be a very, very dangerous
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.800]   situation for the United States. Which is why when people are
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.000]   just kind of making these idle threats, they should be very
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.440]   careful about that, because Iran is hearing that too, and they're
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.800]   getting ready. And one last point on that, thanks to our
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.840]   destabilizing the Middle East with the Iraq war and the Syria
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:23.280]   regime change operation. Iran now has proxies in both Iraq and
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.840]   Syria. They've got Iraqi Hezbollah. They also have
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.520]   proxies in Yemen with the Houthis. And all of those groups
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.840]   could stage attacks on American military bases there.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   We've gone down the worst case scenario here, use of a nuclear
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.780]   bomb, the United States invading Iran, here's just a list of the
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.440]   nine countries that are nuclear powered, and that have nuclear
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   bombs rather than nuclear powered. And as you can see,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.920]   Russia, US, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel, and
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.120]   North Korea, Israel denies they actually have them. And
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.840]   Pakistan has been the one who has been proliferating them,
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   getting bombs to North Korea and helping Iran with their program.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.640]   Ron obviously does not yet have a nuclear bomb. But we don't
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.760]   know how far they are, because intelligence is sparse on that
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.480]   topic. Based on my cursory research.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.360]   What's the best
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.800]   sorry, Jake, I'll be clear. I just want to be clear that I
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.200]   don't see nuclear use as likely as that was free birds point.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.420]   Sorry, I did not say it was likely at all, either. Not at
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.600]   all. No, no, you said it's a small possibility. And we just
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.480]   spent 10 minutes talking about that small possibility.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.320]   Like, let's say something goes from 2% chance to 8% chance.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.760]   It's now four x in the next 20 years. That's right, a
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.520]   significant shift in risk. And I think there have been others,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.300]   like Ray Dalio, I think, or Warren Buffett, some people have
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.520]   said that the chance of us using a nuclear weapon over a long
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.680]   enough period of time, approximates 50 to 100%. It
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.200]   starts to get very high, because, you know, at some
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.640]   point, these things proliferate, the intelligence, the
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.960]   capabilities proliferate, they get into the wrong hands, but
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.400]   there's all these different scenarios that emerge. So the
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.520]   probability might be low on any given period of time. But over a
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.040]   long enough period of time, these things become a real kind
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.560]   of concern. The nukes that were dropped on Hiroshima and
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.960]   Nagasaki are like 20 kiloton yields. I mean, we have massive,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.400]   massive, massive warhead multi warhead missiles that have
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.960]   many, many, many megatons of yield, but there are some 20
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.120]   sub 10 kiloton yield nukes that can be deployed in a
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.360]   conventional in what people would call a tactical setting.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   So you're not trying to
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.640]   this new, they're not literally suitcases that they're on
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.320]   trucks, but tactical nukes are have been produced by Russia,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.200]   China and the United States are the known tactical nuclear
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.920]   powers.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.840]   Well, they're also they're, they're in different forms of
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.560]   delivery, but they're not, you know, you don't take a bomber up
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.080]   and put it over a city and blast.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.600]   No, he's driving in a van is the idea.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.000]   No, it's not necessarily about being on a van. It's like they
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.760]   can be on short range tactical systems. So the point is, like,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.360]   hey, you're caught in a corner, you have nowhere to go and you
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.960]   can't lose. And if you have one of these things, I mean, just
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.480]   take all human history aside. And all convention aside, if
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.200]   you've got this thing, you're trapped in a corner, you got
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.400]   nowhere to go. And you can press this button and when you might
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.120]   press the button.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.640]   And so let's do the other side. What's the best case scenario
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.160]   here? Obviously, we haven't had the ground invasion. We've had
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.640]   Qatar and Saudi and a number in the United States, obviously
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.600]   doing some pretty hardcore diplomacy. And we've had some
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.640]   hostages released. So, you know, I've been spending some time
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.760]   here in the Middle East, there is a theory that people have
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.160]   brought up multiple times here that there's a deal going on
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.240]   right now, to get the hostages a larger number of them. And that
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.960]   the ground invasion may not occur. This is just a theory
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.440]   that a number of people have been talking here, and maybe
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.160]   they're just optimists. But is there an optimistic scenario
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   here to Martha? Is there a golden bridge out of here? Is
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.680]   there a possible path to, you know, the peace process getting
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.160]   back on track? Or does it all just seem hopeless? And if there
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.600]   is, and if there is a possible path, what would that look like?
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.840]   Let's just see if we can come up with any optimistic framing or
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.480]   theory here.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.160]   Why it's just as bad as the other side. Okay, so you don't
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.320]   see one. Yeah. How about we just look at the facts on the
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.120]   ground. The facts are that we have this long simmering war
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   between Russia and Ukraine that doesn't seem to have an end. And
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.760]   there doesn't seem to be a loss of life at which they're willing
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.400]   to stop or whether the international community is
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.080]   willing to force a ceasefire. And then now you have this one,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.320]   which is in 1000s and will escalate into defense of
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.280]   1000s. But it seems like it's on a path to be slow and simmering.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.080]   So I don't know what to say except that it does not seem to
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:10.800]   be escalated. And the reason it isn't escalating is that there
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.120]   isn't enough emotional impact. That's causing people to
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.920]   understand that the stakes are high. And so when the actual
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:28.040]   actions are relatively de escalatory, I find that the
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.160]   rhetoric ratchets up, right? It's almost inversely
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.560]   proportional. You know, it's kind of like, what was the
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.400]   phrase and World War Two about Churchill iron fist wrapped in a
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.840]   velvet glove? Is that is that the phrase something like that.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.600]   But the idea is that when you act decisively, you say little.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.000]   And when you have no plan of really escalating, you say a
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.280]   lot. So I think that right now we're saying a lot, which
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.320]   actually, counterintuitively, to me says we're not planning to do
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.400]   much of anything. And I think that that's good. So I'm all for
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.280]   Lindsey Graham, braying as long as we don't take it too
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.920]   seriously and sleepwalk into some escalation.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.960]   sacks any chance that this gets de escalated? And what might that
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.640]   look like?
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:18.000]   Sure, I think there's a chance. I think like, yeah, well, what
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.480]   it looks like, I think is that the ground invasion keeps
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.920]   getting paused, either because the US needs more time to get
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:32.080]   its military in place, or because the Israeli military
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.280]   realizes this is going to be a very difficult operation, and
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.000]   they need more time to plan. And while that's happening, there's
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.320]   a serious diplomatic effort going on. And while that's
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.480]   happening, there's also more pressure being brought to bear
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.720]   against Israel to not go in. So for example, you saw her to one
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.640]   this week, make some statements, I actually thought they were
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.720]   pretty outrageous, where he described Hamas as basically
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.120]   being freedom fighters, but warning Israel not to go in.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.000]   There were much more reasonable remarks by King Abdullah of
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.200]   Jordan, basically, at least recognizing the atrocity that
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.080]   had taken place against Israel, but also trying to advocate for
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.760]   the lives of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and telling
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.360]   them that it would be a mistake to go in. So you're seeing like
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.600]   a wide range of opinions across, I'd say, major players in the
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.960]   Middle East. But all of it, the gist of it is basically telling
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.720]   the Israelis not to go in. So you've got all these delays and
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.400]   pressures going on. And so maybe there's some chance it could
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.600]   deescalate. I personally think that that's still unlikely. And
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.920]   the main reason for that is I think Israel is determined to go
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.680]   in, I think Netanyahu has made that clear, I think from the
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.880]   Israeli point of view, they don't feel like they have a
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   choice. They've suffered the biggest massacre of of Jews
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.000]   since the Holocaust. And they can't be perceived as simply
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.560]   standing by and doing nothing that would make them look
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.160]   extremely weak in a region of the world, where you don't want
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.360]   to look weak, they have to
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.240]   annihilate Hamas, I guess is the thinking.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.840]   Well, they say that their objective is to destroy Hamas.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.600]   But I think that probably from their standpoint, that
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.440]   considered a success if they could significantly degrade
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:19.280]   Hamas, set them back 10 years, destroy hostages back, destroy
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.600]   their capability to wage war against Israel to undermine
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.360]   their tunnel networks, and so forth. So I think Israel still
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.160]   feels like this is something they have to do. And so I kind
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:33.400]   of think that the most realistic good case scenario is that if
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.760]   they do go in, that the military operation for various reasons,
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.040]   is not a long one, and eventually a ceasefire can be
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.320]   agreed to, before this can escalate out of control. And so
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.680]   there's a bunch of like very delicate red lines there for a
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.120]   lot of different players. And so in order for that scenario to
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.280]   work out, I think it's going to take some very deft behind the
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.920]   scenes diplomacy from the Biden administration, really, and I'm
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.880]   not sure they're capable. I'm not sure they're up to that
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.640]   task. So this is why I think it's such a dangerous situation.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.320]   But can I ask you a question, by the way, is Graham speaking on
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.880]   behalf of the United States officially with the President's
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.440]   approval? He can't possibly be freelancing that I didn't have
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.120]   any. I tried to research it online, I couldn't find any.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.760]   Well, why don't you fill in the blanks? sanctioned or not?
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.760]   Yeah, well, Jason, think about this. David texted this into the
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.880]   group chat and then tweeted it as well. Do you think Mohammed
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.920]   bin Salman is meeting with a group of 10 senators that's just
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:41.640]   off on an adventure? No. Okay, well, there's your answer. Yeah.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.680]   Yeah. No, no, I'm just look at this photo. I think this picture
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.360]   says 1000 words. So you have a delegation of senators, but I
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.480]   count about 10 centers there. Yeah, yeah, they're meeting with
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.400]   Mohammed bin Salman, Republicans and five Democrats, and who has
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.040]   the seat of honor right next to MBS in the front of the room. So
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.400]   I personally would like to believe that Lindsey Graham is
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.720]   just an outlier and he doesn't speak for anybody. But
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.760]   unfortunately, this delegation saw fit to put them in the front
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.960]   of the room. I consider that very scary.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.120]   Well, I think it's also fair to say that the office of MBS would
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.400]   have coordinated that decision with the White House before
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.880]   receiving them. That's typical political protocol. Yeah.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.320]   It just was never explicitly said he didn't say on behalf of
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.360]   the President or the President has sent us here. It just seemed
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.400]   like a disjoint. I hadn't never seen that before. All right, I
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.600]   guess we'll move on to some business issues here. The macro
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.800]   picture is quite confounding GDP, as we were talking about in
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:48.360]   our group chat grew 4.9% year over year in q3, higher than the
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.840]   4.3% expectations and much higher than the 2.1% growth in
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:58.320]   q2. highest year over year GDP since q4 2021. And we thought we
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   were going into a recession, we have a couple of quarters of
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.400]   contraction that hasn't happened. CPI in September is
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.800]   3.7, slightly above the 3.6 estimates. And Chamath, what do
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.840]   you take from all of this? This crazy, high growth GDP? Is this
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.000]   because of stimulus in government spending? What what
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.080]   is this confounding? You know, inflation coming down and
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.600]   getting somewhat under control and then crazy GDP growth? I
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   don't know. I don't think anybody knows. But it's really
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.080]   confounding for the markets. I think it's really bad for
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   markets in general. It's probably the worst for private
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.040]   companies, because you have this effect now where everybody's
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.880]   been wanting to price in a recession, right? Everybody
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.440]   wants to see that shoe drop where they say, Oh, okay, here
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.640]   it is. Something softening demand is softening. And then
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.280]   when you see a print like this, where the economy is expanding,
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.480]   you're kind of confused. And you're like, well, where is the
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.920]   softening going to come from? And so what happens is people
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   become very overreactive to small amounts of data. And that
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.680]   actually started to come out. I think basically, since August,
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.760]   and what's been happening since August is that every time a
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.200]   company reports, the sector that's gotten the most attention
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.840]   has been fintechs. And the reason is that fintechs tend to
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.720]   be on the bleeding edge of capturing consumer demand. And
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.120]   if consumer demand shrinks, that's probably the first sign
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.080]   that there's going to be a recession, right? Because
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.760]   consumption is about almost 70% of the US economy. And so since
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.240]   August, what you've seen are the large leading edge, public
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.480]   fintech companies just get absolutely murdered. And
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.920]   yesterday was an even worse day. Because what happened
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   yesterday was a company was basically world line started to
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   report softness and spending. Now that spending was not even
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.960]   in America, that spending actually happened to be within a
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.480]   segment of their customer base in Germany. And that was enough
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.240]   to just literally sink the stock, I think 60% in a day. So
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.720]   we have on the surface, a healthy growing economy. But
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.520]   underneath the surface, what we what we are betting on,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:25.440]   increasingly, is that consumer demand has basically stopped. So
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.840]   you can see here, odn is down 50% since the beginning of the
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.120]   year. But again, most of this was since August, block is down
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.560]   another 35%. PayPal is down 30%. So. So that's one thing,
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.400]   which is this is a big bet, that consumption is slowing and
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.080]   shrinking, the economy will be in a recession over these next
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.520]   two or three quarters, which will give the Fed the motivation
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.400]   and the justification to lower rates starting in the middle of
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.280]   next year. That's the big bet in the market. But separately, if
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.080]   you take a different lens and look at this data, we all have a
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.760]   bigger problem in Silicon Valley land, which is how do the
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.000]   capital markets take companies public when this is happening.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.800]   And the reason why this data is so important is, we've said this
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.320]   1000 times, there are only two companies that can structurally
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.720]   open the capital markets for all startups. One is SpaceX Starlink,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.800]   but that's on its own path, and not going public soon. And the
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.880]   other stripe. And you're probably a tick tock to that as
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.000]   well. No, because that's a Chinese company with all kinds
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.720]   of overhang. So no, I would disagree with 30 or 40% US
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.680]   ownership. I would disagree with that. But no. So I think it's
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:46.040]   Starlink and stripe. And the the problem now for stripe is that
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.440]   the public comps dollar for dollar are off 50%, which from
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.080]   the beginning of the year, which then says that if you apply that
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.600]   rateably to its valuation, they did around at 55 billion, then
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.160]   the market clearing trade may be 25 to 30 billion now. Now 25 to
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.920]   30 billion for stripe, you're incinerating $70 billion of
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.600]   equity value, right, and about five to $10 billion of actually
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.720]   paid in capital. So what does that do for Silicon Valley and
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.600]   for VCs? I think it's going to put a lot of pressure on
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:23.840]   companies and valuations. So yeah, we're in for a real slog.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.800]   So on the surface for the real economy, I think it's generally
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:33.920]   decent news. For startup land, I think it's not good. And then
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.880]   specifically within startup land sectors like FinTech are in
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.360]   pretty bad trouble, I think.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.400]   And the late stage, obviously still very much in trouble.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.720]   freeberg. Any thoughts on the startup economy? You had some
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.120]   thoughts on this, I think, too.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.320]   I'd like to hear your guys's experiences. But there's
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:53.160]   definitely been a big hold up in series BCD later rounds, because
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.960]   so much of the market questioning is, you know, when
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.080]   when is the next round going to get done, which is based on when
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.440]   can the companies potentially go public. And ultimately, if you
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.520]   don't see a path to a window opening up, you don't fund the
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.080]   pre IPO round, you don't fund the late stage around the growth
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.040]   stage around everything gets held up. And a lot of rounds
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.240]   that are getting done lately have been these kind of convert
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.840]   or bridge rounds where existing investors are funding the
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.360]   company to give it another year or two of runway. That was
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.000]   definitely the case for most of this year coming out of 22. I
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   think post the summer, it seems like a lot of folks I'm talking
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.680]   to are starting to wake up there's even more series B at
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.840]   lower prices, and everyone's kind of capitulating and
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.720]   accepting that there are still great businesses out there. It's
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.760]   just that they got overpriced in their A or their B. And let's
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.040]   price them at a lower valuation and then rounds are sort of
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.560]   starting to get done in the fall here.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.400]   I'll have you react to this data sacks. Carta manages cap tables
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.960]   for folks, but they have produced this chart. And this is
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.400]   Carta companies only. So this is a subsection who knows Carta may
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.880]   power the cap tables of 10% 20% of Silicon Valley, the rest are
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.120]   done on other pieces of software or even in Google Sheets or
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:14.080]   literally in an Excel sheet by an attorney who is working with
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.960]   the company. If you look at this chart in 2020 and 2021, you had
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.840]   about 70 startups shutting down per quarter in 2022. You see
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:30.440]   that number double and we start seeing 129 141 a quarter.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.320]   And then in 2023, this last quarter, Q3, rocketing up to
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.440]   2020. So roughly three times what we see in the boom markets
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.760]   sacks and any thoughts on this data. I have a couple of
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.640]   observations, but I wanted to go to you first.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.920]   Well, this is not surprising to me at all. This is the bubble of
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.280]   2021 working its way through the system. We know that there were
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.120]   these gigantic rounds that were funded in 2021, especially in
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.280]   the second half where you had this asset super bubble. It
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.120]   wasn't just in tech, it was like all growth stocks, crypto
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.360]   everything. And so there were a lot of startups that raised huge
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.200]   funding rounds at the peak of the market, and they haven't had
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.840]   to raise for a couple of years. Well, now they're starting to
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.640]   run out of cash. And they do have to raise they're finally
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.920]   being forced to go back into market and a lot of them are
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   either burning too much money or they don't have the numbers to
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.200]   justify another round or if they do, it's a structured round
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.480]   down round. Or again, they just are unable to raise they have a
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.720]   broken process and they eventually start winding down.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.760]   So I think you're going to see this dynamic for the next 18
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.880]   months or so. But this is not a new dynamic. This is the lagging
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.920]   indicator of what we've been talking about since the regime
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:46.440]   change of the first half of 2022 is that the markets started
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.320]   looking for different things instead of growth at all costs
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.120]   been about growth with unique economics and efficiency. And
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.560]   the valuations went way down. And there's a lot of companies
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.280]   that no longer qualify and they're getting weeded out. So
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.520]   this is just a delayed reaction to things we already knew.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.920]   That's the key part, the delayed reaction as well. Just note when
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.400]   a company does shut down, that process typically takes two or
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.480]   three quarters. And for a founder to accept the shutdown,
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.400]   that might take one, two, three quarters as well. So anything
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.560]   you're seeing in 2023, that might be a shutdown, where the
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.720]   employees were all laid off in late 2022. But I mean, I see
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.480]   that. I have a question for you guys. What what turns this
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.320]   around? I'll tell you what I'm seeing in the early stage. We
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.120]   are seeing many companies come to Founder University, and two
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.880]   or three people who want to build a company who can't get
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.840]   jobs at Google or Stripe, they're not hiring. So we'll see
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.600]   two or three developer teams working on a project and then
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:46.160]   raising 250 500 k at a five to $12 million valuation, and then
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.280]   very quickly getting to 10 to 50 k monthly revenue, all this
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.480]   money that we need to return so that we can recycle and keep
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.040]   doing this job. What what needs to happen? Saks, Friedberg, what
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.520]   do you guys think needs to happen to get to crack? Because
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   like the three IPOs we've had have not fared particularly
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:09.920]   well. And the market just seems to get harder and harder for
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.240]   tech companies, even profitable ones, right?
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.880]   Yeah, I mean, I think I think profitability is key. I think
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.800]   that's the great evolutionary forcing function here. It's like
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.840]   a tale of two world of two startups. The one startup needs
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.240]   cash for a long period of time, and the other one's found a path
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.880]   to profitability, the one that's found a path to
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.600]   profitability, they have an infinite number of options
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.840]   available to them, it might take longer to get public or
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.760]   whatever. But they can wait it out because they don't need
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.880]   money. The one that needs cash continuously and will for a long
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.160]   period of time. It's really screwed.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.560]   What about the multiple of these profitable companies that
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.080]   seems to have changed materially?
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.800]   That's starting to happen as well. Chumaf is that the public
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.320]   markets are looking at their stocks if they're undervalued,
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.840]   and then Dara, Uber is reportedly planning like buying
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.280]   back upwards of 20% of the Uber shares in the next five years.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.520]   And then you look at a company like snap, which is majority
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.800]   control with super voting shares, they're still losing
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.920]   three or 400 million a quarter. So I think freebergs exactly
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.600]   right, tell it to cities, some people refuse. And then if the
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.120]   stock is so cheap, people start buying it back. And the freezing
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.440]   of employees and the expenses going down while revenue goes up
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.240]   and earnings increase. I think that's the setup. If you're
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.440]   looking for the setup, I think it's the public market company
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.080]   showing the path profitability buying back stock. And then
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.760]   these small companies, how does that how does that help private
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.320]   companies go public? If the private companies follow suit,
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.880]   and they're profitable, and they control costs, and they people
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.480]   get greedy looking at how profitable they are, as opposed
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.280]   to their 50% growth rate, they start looking at their
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.200]   increasing earnings and how much cash they're throwing off. And I
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   think that's starting to trickle down through the startup
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.960]   ecosystem, people are trying to get to profit profitability
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.000]   quickly. I don't know. The question was, can we turn it
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.680]   around? I think if they do, that's what it's going to be is
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.400]   profitability.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   Yeah, I mean, I think you guys are kind of talking about two
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.560]   different things. Sure, any particular company can still get
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.160]   its house in order and create a great business. And they'll
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.240]   eventually get, you know, liquidity, they'll go public.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:12.320]   The question is, I think what Smith is getting at is that the
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.600]   exit comps have changed. If you were a tech investor, or let's
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.920]   say a real estate investor, before the regime change, you
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.560]   were underwriting to completely different exit comp. And now
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.120]   those exit comps have totally changed. And so it's gonna be
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.520]   very hard for those investors to make a good return.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.000]   They're gonna lose their money like Instacart. Yeah, I'll give
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.880]   you a mathematical example, just to illustrate what David just
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:41.160]   said. If you have a company with 300 million of ARR, you are in a
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.760]   rare group of say, 30 or 40 companies period, okay. So very,
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.920]   very, very few companies get to that level of scale. But if you
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.360]   are at 100%, net dollar retention, okay, which means
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.440]   that you're kind of treading water, essentially, your
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.120]   customers may grow, but the value of each customer isn't
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.840]   particularly growing. So you know, you have you have pretty
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:10.300]   nominal growth. That company now comps to roughly three to five
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:15.040]   times ARR. Now, the problem is, if you go and look back through
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.400]   crunchbase, or any of these other serve a pitch book, the
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:25.320]   number of companies that traded above $1.5 billion valuation as
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.040]   a SaaS business, there's like 70 of them, but there's only seven
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.880]   of them that have 300 million of it. So what do you what happens
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.420]   guys like the jig is up? Okay. What's going on here?
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.780]   consolidation, I guess, and some of them will flame out. I mean,
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.860]   look at Instacart, the last the people who were the last four
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.700]   rounds, they either lost money or broke even so and that means
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.700]   time adjusted versus what they could have made in the markets.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.140]   They lost money. So what happens if stripe is only worth 30? I
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.760]   mean, how much has been invested into that company? What's the
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.780]   total paid in capital?
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:06.840]   Again, I think we all want stripe to be worth 100. We want
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.880]   it to be worth 200 billion, because it would help. Frankly,
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.560]   it is the rising tide that lifts all boats. But if if unit level
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.360]   profitability is scrutinized, and then comped appropriately to
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.080]   the public markets, as Zack said, we're gonna have to take
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:27.860]   that signal and apply it to our entire portfolio. And so it goes
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.620]   all the way back to eventually the seed in the series A as
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.480]   well, which is really good. Jason, as you've said many times
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.440]   just getting the inflation under control and in check, but it
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.400]   will mean not just changing valuations, but it will mean
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.840]   changing salaries, right? It will mean totally different
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.000]   equity packages, a lot of hard work. I almost think that maybe
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.320]   none of the hard work has actually yet started. So I don't
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.120]   know, I'm just putting that out there, guys. Do you think that
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.340]   we've all just kind of been hoping maybe that all of this
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:02.680]   would pass? And now we're getting more and more signals
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.720]   that we actually have to do a pretty hard valuation reset?
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.120]   Yeah, I mean, if you look at the altimeter charts that jam on
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.720]   balls put out, I mean, the valuation levels are returning
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.120]   to let's call it the pre COVID mean. In fact, they're slightly
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.320]   below the pre COVID mean because the 10 year Treasury has a
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.280]   higher rate. So yeah, we're going back to something that was
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.740]   more like I don't know, 2015 levels of valuation, and maybe
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.340]   even slightly worse again, because long term rates are
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.380]   higher. So cost of capital and hurdle rate are higher.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.060]   That's what I'm saying. I'm seeing 2012 valuations,
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.260]   valuation of Uber when I invest was 5 million.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.100]   Yeah, let me just tell you, it's a lot harder for people to make
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.240]   money when the money supply is shrinking, than when the money
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.300]   supply is growing. For obvious, when the money supply is
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.160]   shrinking, it's like you're playing a game of musical
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.640]   chairs. And you're just hoping that you still have a seat.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.400]   Whereas when the pie is increasing, it's a lot easier to
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.600]   get like a piece of it. But when the pie is just hard to get a
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.000]   piece,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.800]   musical chairs, as you're describing is where you're is
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.240]   literally the description of the venture capital industry and
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.020]   GPS right now. A lot of people are losing their seats. Yeah.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.960]   And I think a lot of shutdowns of venture firms, I think a lot
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.640]   of venture firms are going to shut down. This could be zombie
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   funds. I think we got to believe the extraordinary outcomes make
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.440]   up the bulk of returns in venture from, you know, the
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.200]   singular companies, and there's a few of them. Right, there's
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.440]   $15 billion exits created every year. I don't know if it's
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.200]   unicorns as valued in private markets or actual exits. But as
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.400]   we know, every couple of years, there's a company that comes
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.480]   along that's worth 10 billion. And every once a decade, there's
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.560]   a company that comes along that ends up being worth 100 billion.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:53.200]   And the bulk of the returns in the entire venture landscape
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.680]   comes from those handful of companies. I think we end up
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.480]   focusing a lot on market metrics as the performance driver for
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.280]   venture returns. But the truth is, it's the performance driver
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.960]   for the mid tier of venture returns. And that mid tier
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:15.640]   venture returns is skating along at two x multiple after 10 years
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.840]   or three x after 10 to two to two and a half x after 10 years,
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.800]   that's the top quarter, right. And so whatever it is 1.8 x, and
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.600]   now those guys are all underwater. So instead of being
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.320]   1.8 x, they're all going to return point seven x, or point
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.000]   five x, and they're gonna lose money.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.040]   Now, I think the I think the 50th percentile returns money.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.160]   Okay, but the truth is, so now they're gonna lose money. But
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:39.800]   the truth is, whichever funds get the tiger by the tail,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.840]   whoever gets the Uber at 5 million, whoever gets the slack
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.200]   at whatever you got in at whoever got to the SpaceX or
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.800]   whatever sacks got in at, you're going to be fine, because like
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.120]   the multiples in markets don't matter as much if you're
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:52.840]   generating
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.040]   9000. I don't think that's true. Because if it happens in a fund,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:02.880]   and that all of those deals, except SpaceX happened in a
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.680]   different valuation framework where rates were zero. So I
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.200]   think the question the more intellectually honest question is
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.760]   what would slack and Uber have gone public at today, with a 5%
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.560]   10 year? And I think the answer if you're going to be
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.040]   intellectually honest is a very different valuation than when it
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.520]   went out when the 10 year was zero,
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.000]   it's going to be hard to make outsized returns on less than
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.360]   until the entry price is completely correct. And I think
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.200]   they've partially corrected, but they may not have fully corrected
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.520]   because people, I think always want to believe that there's
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.040]   going to be a bounce back. Yeah, and it takes time to kill that
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:38.440]   hope.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.760]   I think I think that
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.200]   capitulation is, I think that capitulation is starting to
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:49.360]   happen, to be honest. I mean, that was my observation. I feel
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.200]   like everything was so shut down. Last year, the start of
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.360]   this year through the summer. And then in the fall, like just
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.480]   the last couple of months, it feels like there's this
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.960]   capitulation where it's like, okay, we're worth 80% less, but
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.920]   we need money. Let's do the deal. Okay, we'll put money in.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.120]   I don't think the reset can happen until stripe goes public.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.760]   I'll be very specific. I think that is the company that sets
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.080]   the cascading valuation framework for every other
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.600]   company. So I think all of this is a bunch of people, us
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.960]   blathering on and making stuff up. I think the true numerical
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.480]   forcing function, the clearing event happens when they go
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.600]   public, because it will it will be you won't be able to hide
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.800]   like I think we all would say it's the best run company that's
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.880]   private. It's the most technical, it's gotten the most
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.680]   people it's gotten the most pristine cap table, it's raised
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:44.560]   the most money at the like, it's done everything right. It's the
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   gold standard. Yes. And what their valuation is, is then what
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.440]   you can expect if you are of that caliber. Or you can expect
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.200]   a lower valuation if you are not of their caliber. And I think
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.520]   that until we know what that is, we're all going to be hoping.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.400]   And but we know that hope is in a strategy. So my takeaway from
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.680]   all of this is just more that people have to really right size
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.960]   the portfolio, sell what you can find liquidity where there are
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.520]   people that want to buy at different entry prices, they may
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.920]   not be the price that you thought originally, but you
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.200]   know, make sense for them and their risk profile in this
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.560]   moment in time, all of this stuff has to happen to actively
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.720]   manage to exits, I think,
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.160]   well, and there's a new phenomenon that's going on, that
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.360]   I've been seeing a lot of I've been approached by a number of
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.720]   people who are doing buying strips of GP interest and strips
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.080]   of LP interest in venture funds. From the last 10 years, I got
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.320]   offered for a five x on paper fund, like three point whatever
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.840]   x you know, and you could clear out like you're saying some of
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.520]   your shares, I got offered, you know, half price basically, by
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.840]   some people who I think I don't want to say the bottom feeders,
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.320]   but I think they're maybe optimistic about certain names.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:58.920]   And yeah,
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.720]   I've noticed that the amount of activity from secondary brokers
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.280]   seems to have increased. And, yeah, and, and specifically that
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.720]   the emails that I get that are interesting are the ones where
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.400]   they're asking me to sell shares. So when someone's
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.040]   offering you that doesn't mean anything, because there may not
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.800]   be any transactions clearing, but when they have definite
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.920]   buyer interest at a certain price, that tells you that the
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.120]   market now has found or is in the process of finding the
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:32.280]   market. Yeah, so I think I think we do actually know, from the
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.200]   secondary market, kind of where a lot of these unicorns are at.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.080]   My guess,
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.600]   what would you say on average half?
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.800]   Yeah, there's
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.480]   that's what I see. I see a lot of half price action.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.240]   That's not I'm not trying to be a wet blanket guys. But the
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.920]   average SaaS company that's public is down 75%. If you look
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.280]   at the fintech space, these companies are down 80 to 90%. So
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.840]   how can half be reasonable? Well, just for certain names.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.120]   Yeah,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.600]   because I think the really bad names don't get any liquidity,
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.680]   like there's just no buyers. So you're talking about names where
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.400]   there's already a buyer. So that's going to bias it towards
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.360]   the better companies.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.640]   And when square and odd, and these are great companies, right
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.880]   that are down 80 90%. How can a private liquid company be only
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   down 50%?
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.800]   Maybe it's not priced correctly. But maybe also there's been two
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.280]   or three years of growth since that last private valuation. So
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.920]   maybe there's some selection bias, maybe it's there's 20 30%
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.440]   growth.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.480]   Yeah, but but add Jen and stripe of all I mean, square have also
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.280]   grown by 50%.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.520]   I mean, you also have let me we have a comp on this, which is
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.440]   Instacart 39 billion peak profit market valuation is trading at
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.000]   like, six and a half billion, which I think is exactly what
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.240]   you said, Jamal, when we were pricing it, we looked at that
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.720]   800. I think what I know, but I had said 800 million, and I just
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.880]   put it out like, there was 800 million in advertising revenue.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   And I said, Okay, you know, seven, eight, nine times that
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.480]   that top line, or if I said if it was, if it was 50%, margin,
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.280]   you can give it 20x. So I think that's how I came up with my
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.200]   number. And I think we came up with eight based on that. And
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.600]   you're sure enough, that's basically where it's trading 6.8
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.440]   billion. Yeah,
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.680]   it's amazing. It's on 26%. Since it IPO. Now, I will say that
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.200]   Instacart is an example of a company that has historically
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.680]   had very high burn, and it's a very capital intensive business
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.880]   relatively, whereas a good software business, like take a
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.680]   Clavio, for example, is much more capital efficient, and
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.160]   should be doing better. Clavio is down 16%. Since this IPO,
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   market cap about 7 billion. So yeah, it's an ugly story. I
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.520]   mean, even for the names that just IPO, it's not looking too
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.840]   good. Yeah, I mean, revenue profits that that clears it
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.360]   out. I do think there's going to be a lot of GPS or arm down 21%.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.680]   So that's a lot of money. Yeah. Look, I think the market has
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.240]   just turned very negative very recently. It comes back to this
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.440]   GDP report. You know, when I saw the 4.9% number, I mean, the
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.200]   thing that occurred to me, the larger theme is that there's
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.400]   such a divergence right now between Main Street and Wall
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.880]   Street.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.440]   Explain why the GDP is so strong right now. And that would
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.600]   indicate that the economy is strong. Therefore, stocks should
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.800]   go up, right? Why? Why is that not happening? I think this is
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.480]   the next maybe confusing for people.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.920]   Well, I mean, I'm not sure I can fully explain it. So I think
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.080]   there's a lot of contradictory data. But if you look at Main
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.680]   Street, you're seeing whatever 4.9% GDP growth, you're seeing
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.480]   pretty robust employment numbers, the consumer seems to
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.360]   be holding up. But if you look at Wall Street, and the
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.200]   investment side of things, it's pretty miserable. The whole
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.240]   stock market this year is being held up by seven stocks, the so
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.920]   called magnificent seven is the top seven tech names in the
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.640]   S&P 500. If you look at the overall S&P 500, excluding those
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.800]   names, it's flat for the year. And it's basically given back
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.320]   all the gains. And now those seven names are starting to
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.760]   crack. So just in the last week or so, Tesla went down a bit.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.240]   Yeah, we're seeing them go down. And so, yeah, and Facebook. So
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.160]   we're seeing then you know, Microsoft had a great quarter,
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.320]   but it's now down, it's given back that that pop. So you're
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.640]   seeing that on the investment side of things, it's still
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:28.120]   pretty grim out there, because people are now pricing in higher
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.440]   rates for longer. That's basically what's happening. And
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.120]   the thing I wonder about the I mean, here's the disconnect is
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:41.040]   that ultimately, what happens on Wall Street affects the consumer,
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.800]   their 401ks go down in value, the value of their houses go
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.400]   down, because now, you can't, if you if you sell your house, you
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.480]   lose your 3% mortgage, now you have to get a new one at 8%. So
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.240]   everyone stopped trying to sell their house, the number of real
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.320]   estate transactions gone down a lot, that's gradually working
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.040]   its way through the system. So at some point, the consumer
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.600]   realizes that they're just not as wealthy as they thought they
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.520]   were. That's the wealth effect, and they just stopped spending
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.120]   as freely. And we already know that credit card debt, and
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.760]   especially credit card servicing costs are at all time highs
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.680]   because of these high interest rates. So at some point, you
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.600]   just wonder if the consumer is like Wile E. Coyote, and has
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.440]   gone off a cliff, but just hasn't looked down yet.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.480]   Yeah, just like the country, just like our government, it's
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.040]   like we're just, everybody's just spending, and nobody's
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.320]   actually paying attention to the balance sheet, whether it's the
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.680]   government or individuals, apparently, because credit card
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.000]   debts now at its highest, and people are still yellow, I
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.560]   don't mean is because the only possible explanation with the
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:47.360]   consumer is that consumers wages, and the unemployment, the
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.840]   low unemployment, persistent low unemployment, the number of jobs
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.720]   available, is just making everybody super confident. But
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.160]   that's got to end at some point, right? Doesn't it? I think
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.680]   companies keep cutting their belts.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.480]   I don't think Wall Street and Main Street can be disconnected
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.800]   forever. I think it's got to reconcile one way or another.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.960]   So I would describe our economic situation as as fragile. I mean,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.600]   I think most commentators, like Bill Ackman, still thinks that
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.320]   things are going to turn south that this this GDP number is
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.400]   sort of a number. I don't know, it's just things still seem kind
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.360]   of shaky to me. And not exactly the recipe that you want, when
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.400]   you have this massive geopolitical instability.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.880]   Yeah, exactly. That double whammy and then plus the
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.320]   election coming up and the chaos that that could cause in the
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.520]   country. It's kind of like that quote about going bankrupt, how
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.840]   did it happen slowly, and then all at once. I think that's kind
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.120]   of what we're heading towards. This has been happening slowly.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.520]   And then everybody's gonna wake up with a heck of a credit card
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.600]   bill at 15 or 20%. And they're not gonna be able to pay it.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.960]   Although just like the government will have to
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.720]   intervene there. They can't be in a situation where I agree with
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.640]   tomorrow, a large percentage of the US consumers just can't.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.320]   This is my point of view on Yeah, on consumer and all this
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.000]   commercial real estate and the bank loans. Eventually, the Fed
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.640]   monetizes all this stuff. It's the only path, which by the way,
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.760]   will inflate a lot of financial assets. And if that actually
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.160]   you bring up another data point we haven't discussed, which is
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.560]   there's a major storm cloud out there, which is major US banks
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.080]   are facing large unrealized losses. So Bank of America had
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.760]   unrealized losses of 131 billion on securities in q3. JP
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.960]   Morgan Chase had a realized loss of 40 billion in its health and
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.320]   maturity portfolio in q3. And Citigroup did not disclose its
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.960]   losses for q3. But it had 24 billion of losses at the end of
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.040]   q2. So remember this dynamic that we had with SVB and all
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.560]   these banks back in was like March, where all these regional
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.080]   banks were basically had these large and realized losses and
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.480]   then it created a run on a few of them. Well, now the biggest
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.000]   banks are starting to face that unrealized losses problem. Now,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.840]   I don't think like Bank of America, JP Morgan or Citigroup
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.560]   are going to have a run on the bank, but they're clearly not
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.880]   doing that great. And at some point, there's gonna have to be
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.040]   a reconciliation of that.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.160]   Unless they hold it to maturity, I guess we should do just a
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.280]   quick hit here on this cruise follow up story. We talked
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:23.240]   earlier about the cruise accident and self driving. Well,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.320]   a lot of news has come out about this gentleman that is
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.480]   potentially explosive. As we all know, just to catch everybody
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.600]   up on October 2, there was a hit and run accident. And this
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.840]   tangentially included that cruise vehicle, the cruise
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.360]   vehicle, a woman tragically got hit by a car driven by a human
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:49.520]   that that car ran off. The woman got knocked into in front of a
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.400]   cruise self driving car, which then ran her over. Okay,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.080]   California's DMV has suspended cruise and their permit. Because
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.200]   allegedly, the company withheld footage of the incident. If you
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.880]   remember, we had a little discussion here about the taxi
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.560]   had rolled over the person. And then we talked about, hey, you
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.720]   know, you're not supposed to move off of the person when we
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.360]   did our whole joke about EMT J Cal. Well, it turns out, after
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.120]   the AV collision, the cruise vehicle apparently pulled the
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.880]   woman for 20 feet. And this has been confirmed now by cruise.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:31.760]   But when cruise gave that information to the regulatory
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.040]   agency, the California DMV, they didn't show that footage. In
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.520]   other words, they showed just the first half of the footage.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.840]   And that has gotten their license suspended. So we have
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.160]   we're left to interpret why did cruise not tell the full truth
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.040]   to the DMV. And now freeberg to your point about society taking
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:59.200]   risk. Now we have allegedly cruise. I don't know what the
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.960]   most generous way to say this is, but they either omitted or
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.400]   they straight up lied to the California D DMV DMV. I mean,
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.440]   J Cal, if it's true that they lied and were deceptive about
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.920]   the video, then yeah, that's like do not pass go go directly
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.880]   to jail time. I mean, that's really bad. Yeah. One point I
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.840]   made last time was I didn't think cruise was sophisticated
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.480]   enough tech or really GM, who's their backer was sophisticated
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.840]   enough technologically to get this right. And I still
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.480]   maintain that. And so if on top of that, they were deceptive
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.680]   about what happened, then that's like the kill shot. One
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.980]   question I have J Cal is there was an NBC reporter who was on
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.160]   the scene just happened to be on the scene. And I remember her
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.120]   reporting that cruise was not responsible. So I'm just
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.240]   wondering, like where the disconnect here is between all
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]   these various reports.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.680]   I have a theory, I have a theory, which is not responsible
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.320]   for the accident, but then responsible potentially for the
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.920]   subsequent the dragging of the body. So I think that's the the
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.860]   issue here is that they may be able to claim, hey, we had
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.240]   nothing to do with the accident. But then in what happened after
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.400]   the accident, yes, the technology failed, apparently,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.520]   or maybe the technology never took into account what happens
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.280]   if you run somebody over that was rocketed under your car. And
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.040]   maybe that's just a freak accident that we have to get
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.080]   used to that possibility happening. And that could
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.480]   happen with obviously human drivers. So it's just a
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.960]   possibility that that could happen.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.880]   You don't think that that case is hard coded?
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.760]   I mean, the edge case of how would the car know there's a
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.480]   person underneath it? I don't know.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.680]   No, but I'm saying you're you're bringing up something so
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.760]   obvious as to be comical, which is like, of course, there has to
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.840]   be some emergency cut off when there's like some obstruction.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   Anyway, sure. Let's let all the facts. I think we'll wait for
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.600]   the rest of the facts to come out. We've got I think 80% of
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.480]   them here 90% of them. But freeberg, you had told us in the
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.320]   group chat that Hurricane Otis would potentially be disastrous
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.640]   for Mexico. And turns out you are correct. 27 people are dead
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.480]   in Mexico. And maybe you can explain to us why this storm is
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.000]   unique. And why, if you think this, that we're seeing more of
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.200]   these? Or are we seeing more of these? Or is the coverage in the
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.760]   media? Yeah, you know, in the reaction to it? Getting
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.240]   distorted?
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.800]   I don't know about the media coverage. The big story with
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:36.240]   Hurricane Otis is that it went from being kind of a tropical
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.480]   storm to being a category five hurricane in about six hours.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.080]   And then it made landfall in Acapulco and a category five
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.400]   hurricane. And no hurricane forecasting models had
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.560]   predicted this and hurricane forecasting models are what are
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.120]   you know, typically run off of ensemble models, meaning that
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.400]   there are multiple things that may happen. And that those
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.920]   simulations are run on very compute intensive systems. And
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.800]   there are many, many simulations being run all the time, every
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.760]   six hours, the simulation runs are done. And then you look at
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.840]   these and you create a probability of things that may
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.400]   happen. And none of the forecasts had any probability
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.560]   associated with this event happening. It was so out of the
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.120]   bounds of anything we have seen historically, that none of the
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.680]   models had any chance ascribed to this tropical storm suddenly
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.600]   evolving into a category five hurricane in six hours, and then
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.720]   making landfall on a city with a million people. We can look at
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.280]   pictures if you guys want and what happened in Acapulco. It's
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.280]   obviously pretty devastating. There's apparently no powerline
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.840]   standing in the entire region. Here's some photos. I mean, look
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.040]   at this like, wow, 165 mile an hour sustained winds. The
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.920]   eyewall went through the town. So a million people, by the way,
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   many of whom live in not concrete reinforced buildings up
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.880]   against the mountain there. And so the devastation is really
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.680]   extraordinary. But the shocking thing is that there was no prep.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.520]   There was no warnings, there was no alerts. There were a ton of
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.840]   tourists sitting in these hotels. Look at that. I don't
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.000]   know if you have any of the hotel photos, Nick. But it's
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.800]   insane. There are zero windows left in any of the hotels, any
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.680]   of the condos, any of the resorts, they are gone. So
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.760]   imagine you're like, in Acapulco, you're drinking beer
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.280]   and tequila. And then you go to sleep. And this thing hits at 1am
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:24.000]   as a category five hurricane and destroys everything. There's no
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.120]   power, there's nothing. So if you pull up the first chart,
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.240]   most of the energy that is absorbed from the sun ends up in
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.800]   our oceans. So you know, we talked about atmospheric carbon
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.160]   increasing energy retention. And people can debate that all they
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.480]   want where the carbon comes from, etc, etc. At the end of
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:47.120]   the day, there is energy coming into the earth from the sun. And
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.240]   that energy is being retained. The vast majority of that energy
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.080]   is retained by the oceans. So the first couple 100 meters of
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:00.800]   the oceans retain north of 90% of the energy absorbed by Earth
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.840]   to go to the next slide. So that results in water temperatures
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.560]   going up. So if you look at this is compared to the 1955 to 2006
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.320]   average, and you can measure ocean heat content, but ocean
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.440]   heat content has risen fairly linearly since the 90s. And you
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.120]   can kind of see, you know, how much excess is actually related
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.920]   to temperature perfectly or no. So this is ocean temperatures
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.760]   over time. So here you can see 2023. And so this shows you the
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.640]   average sea surface temperature. So 2023 has been such an
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.800]   outlier. And this is also because of these El Nino
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.200]   phenomena. But there's obviously over time, if you were to look
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.440]   at the average sea surface temperature trend, it's rising
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.920]   linearly with heat content over time. And in particular, in
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.720]   2023, there's an extraordinary rise in temperature. So off the
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.240]   coast of Acapulco, the sea surface temperature was 88
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.120]   degrees Fahrenheit. I mean, it was so hot, the water like
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.280]   imagine an 80. That's like a David Sack swimming pool. It's
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.720]   so you know, going down many meters in the ocean. So when a
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.080]   storm goes over that level of heat, it takes heat out of the
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.880]   ocean. And that heat coming out of the ocean increases the wind
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.480]   speed. And then the wind speed pulls more heat out of the
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.040]   ocean. And that's how these things become escalatory until
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.080]   they hit something cold, like a mountain or the land, the land
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.440]   is much cooler. And then these things start to dissipate and
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.960]   break apart. And that's why these things form over the
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:27.320]   ocean. So the point is, no models predicted this. And
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.160]   that's because we've never seen this level of energy stored in
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.080]   the oceans before. And the model training has never really
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.400]   accounted for this sort of extreme condition. This extreme
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.840]   condition, obviously, is what some folks are arguing is
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.120]   becoming more frequent. So it brings into question, you know,
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.280]   the this, this, this ability for us to actually forecast the
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.600]   rise in the temperature over time is driving this. And then,
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.480]   oh, from an economic perspective, this is one of the
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.000]   key points I wanted to make. When an event like this happens,
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.360]   there's a market called the reinsurance market. And the
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.040]   reinsurance market sets the price for covering insurance
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.000]   companies against a big loss, where you can lose a ton of
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.680]   stuff at once. Insurance companies like to write
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.240]   insurance policies like car insurance is a great business.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.000]   Because there's never one big event that causes everyone to
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.680]   get in an accident on the same day. But with property
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.680]   insurance, a hurricane can cause everyone to lose on the same
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.160]   day. So insurance companies need to buy reinsurance. And then
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.120]   there's these big reinsurance companies and they have pools of
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.520]   capital and there's capital markets involved in bonds that
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.200]   are sold to protect reinsurance. So there's, you know, hundreds
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.680]   of billions of dollars trillion dollar plus in reinsurance. When
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.120]   an event like this happens, those reinsurance markets take a
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.160]   loss. And the loss causes them to raise rates significantly.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.320]   And it's and when that happens, the reinsurance markets harden
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.000]   is what they say. And then rates go up next year for
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.560]   reinsurance. And then the insurance companies pass those
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.960]   rates on to consumers, and to property developers and to the
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.880]   people that have mortgages. And the more of these events happen,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.920]   even though it just happened in Acapulco, it impacts insurance
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.760]   rates everywhere. So as we see the events like what happened in
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.720]   Maui, what happened in Acapulco, what happened in Miami, you can
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.720]   start to see more of these things start to happen at the
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.040]   same time, the cost for insuring property goes up. And that
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.480]   starts to make this whole system very difficult to maintain
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.360]   because if the cost for insurance doubles or triples,
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.400]   and people can't really afford it, but the mortgages require
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.880]   that they have it in all of these high risk coastal cities
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.720]   and coastal areas. That's where an economic hit either has to be
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.280]   absorbed by the federal government, or
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.440]   we end up taking a mask or we can't get insurance, right? Or
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.560]   we take a massive economic loss. And so I just want to say like,
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.480]   this seems like an outlier event. And oh, my gosh, we
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.520]   should be sorry and sad. But the truth is, the frequency of these
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.920]   events and the risk factors, which is this ocean heat
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.120]   temperature, rising continuously for a long period of time, are
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.640]   going to drive that frequency of events. And there's going to be
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.280]   a real economic cost to bear on the order of several trillion
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.960]   dollars over time, because someone has to underwrite that
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.200]   real estate and someone has to underwrite the insurance to
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.880]   support that real estate. So it may seem like a one off and oh,
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.200]   you know, this won't be a big deal. But it actually translates
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.920]   economically through the reinsurance and insurance
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.320]   markets into the real estate markets fairly quickly. And so I
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.720]   just wanted to kind of point out one of the second order
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.560]   consequences of this article in the Wall Street Journal a few
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.320]   weeks ago, Nick, you can probably find it about this
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.120]   exact issue where they profiled the handful of homeowners, I
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.480]   think it was in Palm Beach or West Palm Beach. And they
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.920]   essentially had to sell and leave because they couldn't
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.400]   afford the home insurance or for those that own their home
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.360]   outright, they just stopped insuring it because they
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.040]   realized the land value would be fine. And so they said, if a
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   storm there it is, if a storm, you know, if a storm hits, you
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.880]   know, West Palm and destroys my home, you know, hopefully I'll
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.880]   be fine. And then I'll just leave and I'll just sell it for
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.920]   the dirt. But to your point, it's become economically
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.240]   untenable in a lot of places for these folks to be able to
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:03.000]   ensure, ensure their home. Look at this on this example $121,000
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.560]   a year for home insurance. Right? What?
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.480]   How's my way, by the way, so add up the value. Well, that's
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.400]   because there's a one in 10 chance that a hurricane is
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.360]   going to hit them on any given year, right? And then they lose
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.120]   their whole value. So do the math on what the total real
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.120]   estate value in that region is. And think about what it gets
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:22.040]   written gets written down to as everyone starts to sell. And
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.280]   then you do that across all these regions where there's now
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.480]   high risk and lack of insurance available. And you have a real
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.080]   economic question on who's going to step in to support and buoy
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.400]   those asset values.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.080]   Now, but aren't there state actors now that step in and act
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:36.960]   as a reinsurer?
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.520]   Great question. In Florida, they have a reinsurance pool that is
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.880]   largely assumed to be completely underfunded. And so everyone
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.760]   says like Florida's got this reinsurance pool, the right
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.720]   your stuff. But Florida if people if you ask people in the
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.960]   reinsurance industry, they're like, this thing's basically
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.640]   bankrupt, it's completely insolvent, this isn't real. So
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.040]   the federal government's going to be asked to step in and cover
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.560]   that thing at some point. And then someone's got to write a
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.600]   trillion dollar check. I mean, you know, you want to complain
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.480]   about sending 100 billion to Ukraine, Israel, wait until most
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.760]   of the country has to underwrite coastal communities real estate
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.280]   values.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.200]   So Silicon Valley actually needs to be pro climate change so that
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.960]   you can reinflate the money supply.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.200]   Wow, I mean, and then the other the other I mean,
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.480]   I'm being facetious, but I'm kind of not it's really crazy
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.720]   that so many industries it I think SAC said it really, really
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.840]   quite perfectly. When the money supply is shrinking, there's
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.480]   just a lot less money to go around when the money supply is
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.040]   growing. It's much easier for all of us to grab a share of it.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:37.480]   And now that it's shrinking, you have this weird effect where you
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.880]   actually want government intervention, which
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.320]   unfortunately only happens in acute tragedies and calamities.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:48.120]   And so what are we hoping for now as a society? That's a very
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:48.920]   scary idea.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.400]   The second one, in fact, is who's going to buy these homes
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.360]   if they can't be insured, right? It's not going to crash home
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.360]   prices, Freiburg.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.840]   That's my point is that these assets aren't worth what they're
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.040]   currently marked at. And if you add up all of the real estate
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.480]   assets in all of these different regions, that you know, everyone
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.520]   assumes are worth x. But the only reason they're worth x is
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.840]   because they're insured. And if they're not insured, people are
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.480]   gonna have to start to sell them. If they can't afford the
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.920]   insurance, they're gonna start some, then the real value starts
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.560]   to come out. These sorts of events like Acapulco are
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.920]   catalyzing events for forcing the market to rewrite this.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.320]   That's, that's, this is the beginning of a cascading effect.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.640]   I saw a really interesting study about the the risk of the rising
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.000]   oceans and just the salinity of the oceans to all the real
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.400]   estate in Malibu. And the reason is that, you know, if you look
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.480]   at the Malibu coastline, there's a small number of homes, but
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.120]   they trade at an extreme amount of economic value. But what
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:46.360]   underpins all of that stuff are that these homes are viable, and
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.280]   that you can live in them and that you don't have to replace
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.920]   them. And if you can sufficiently drill far into the
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.000]   bedrock, you can keep these homes safe. And this study was
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.560]   just talking about how the corrosive effects of the ocean
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.240]   are such now that you can't actually do that to the same
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.400]   rate when you when you actually initially buy these homes. So
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.840]   now you have these 50 and $100 million homes that are really at
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   risk of just corroding and falling into the sea.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.200]   Interesting.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.560]   Yeah, that's always been an issue there. And you're right on
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.520]   the PCH highway. And there's a small amount of land between you
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.320]   and the water. So if it starts rising, or it's corrosive, you
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.600]   know, I've rented those homes before friends of ours have as
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.960]   well. And the water just goes right underneath the homes. And
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.080]   every year, it goes a little bit further onto the home. Right?
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.640]   Yeah. And you can't in some of the homes now, when they when
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.360]   they rent them to you for the summer, they say, Hey, listen,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.640]   during high tides, you can't get to the beach. safely, you can
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.720]   like jump off your back porch and jump into a wave. But you
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.760]   know, low tide, you can get down and use the beach. If not, you
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.920]   have to walk down the street and go down like, you know, another
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.320]   person's alley to get to the water.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   Take out where are you now?
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.200]   So I have been in the Middle East, I got to go to Riyadh for
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.760]   the first time and in the UAE for the second time. I don't
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.440]   have any business interests here. But I have been taking a
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.920]   bunch of meetings. And the reason I went is I'm actually
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.840]   and I'll pre announce it here. I'm going to be bringing this
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.120]   week and startups, I'm going to do a series from the Middle
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.120]   East and feature the capital allocators and the startups
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.920]   that are growing here at the startup scene here is
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.640]   extraordinary. And I'm going to bring my founder university to
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.560]   the region as well. And I'm going to start teaching
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.880]   entrepreneurs here in the region, Egypt, Saudi, UAE,
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.240]   Qatar, anybody Jordan who wants to learn how to build a company,
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.720]   I'm going to be teaching startups in the region. And so
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.920]   pretty exciting. And I think startups, you know, at their
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.840]   core is hope and personal freedom to change the world.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.600]   And I think if we build deep relationships between these
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.200]   important countries that are playing a bigger and bigger role
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.760]   in the global stage, and we we build companies together, that's
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.800]   going to be great for America, American interests. So what I'm
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.360]   doing here since people have been asking, yeah.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.640]   What if anything has changed between what you thought of the
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.040]   Middle East versus what you think of it now? Has anything
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.840]   changed? Did you have a different view of Saudi? Let's
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.240]   take Saudi, for example, what did you think of Saudi and MBS
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.440]   before you went? And what do you think now after you've been
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:03.940]   there?
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.000]   Well, there, there was very little change in that society
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.800]   over the last 30 or 40 years. And based on what they've told
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.000]   me, you know, spending a lot of time with a lot of people there,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.080]   I maybe had, I don't know, 30 individual meetings, or coffees,
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.520]   dinners, literally 30 different people. And they've told me
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.560]   everything's changed. So personal freedoms have changed
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.680]   radically, economic freedoms have changed radically, the
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.640]   political political system hasn't changed. Nor do I think
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.840]   that's going to change radically. But yes, my opinion
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.520]   of it. The reality of it is it's changed massively. And then on
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.440]   top of that, yeah, I have learned a lot. I've never been
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.920]   there. The entrepreneurial excitement in the region,
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.200]   Saturday, you were do you think you were too judgmental before?
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.960]   I have some core principles that I believe in. And what I will
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.080]   say is from doing this podcast with the three of you, and then
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.560]   being thrust into, like geopolitics, which, you know, I
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.560]   really haven't been in my life, I felt I needed to get more
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.360]   educated. I feel I am more educated now, after doing all
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.680]   these meetings. And I think the big education is the people here
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.360]   are not much different than the folks in our country. And they
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.800]   all want peace, prosperity, personal freedoms, they want to
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.880]   have a great life for their families. So to that extent, I
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.720]   think and each of the countries is very different, you know, and
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.800]   so you can't paint with a wide brush. Now, of course, I know
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.440]   that. But there's no substitute for being here and spending time
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   with people. So
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.880]   so do you think that you just had a misconception? Or do you
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.680]   think you just fell for what the media tried to portray these
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.280]   countries when there were incidents? Like, how do you how
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.120]   do you reconcile that as you change your mind about them?
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   Well, I, I think things have actually changed here more than
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.680]   I've changed my mind. I still feel the same way I feel about
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.440]   human rights and, you know, personal freedoms and everything
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.840]   like that. But what I've learned is that this area is changing so
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.240]   quickly. And that change is hard. And David said something
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.560]   really important, you know, it's like, you need strong people to
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.160]   make these changes here. And they're going to make the
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.320]   changes on their time. So the other thing, I think, if there's
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.040]   anything that has influenced me, it's probably what David said,
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:23.040]   you know, it's like, this is gonna be hard to make the
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.080]   changes here. And another thing you said, you know, there was
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.720]   one point you've said on this pod, like, hey, do you think
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.880]   they care what you think, right? They actually do care, they
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.960]   listen to the pod. But the truth is, the changes are going to
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.920]   occur here, Chamath, whether we're involved or not. And so I
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.920]   think as Americans, what we have to decide, and as business
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.720]   leaders, how involved do we want to be in that change? And how
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.140]   deep of those relationships do we want to build? Because if we
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:48.840]   don't build those relationships, there are other people who would
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:53.160]   like to forge relationships, right? Russia, China, etc. So I
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.240]   think just in terms of the chessboard that we see playing
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.080]   out right now, the more America can engage with this region,
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.680]   build companies with them, I think it's going to be better
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.740]   for humanity and society. And I think if you look at China, we
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:12.360]   disengaged, and how's that going for us? Yeah, it's going
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.800]   terrible. So I want to build companies here. And that's the
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.640]   thing is people are having big talks about all of these issues,
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:24.000]   human rights, changes. And so I, the thing I want to make sure
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.120]   people understand is, I want to see positive change in the
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.960]   world, including our country here everywhere. And so, you
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.800]   know, it's never coming from a place of trying to be preachy to
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.320]   people, I just want to see positive change in the world.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.520]   And, you know, now with this podcast being so popular, people
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.560]   have expectations of us. And one of the expectations is we we
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.360]   know what we're talking about. And I did not know what I was
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.040]   talking about in this region, because I never spent time here,
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.080]   just like Saks has never been to Ukraine, what does he know about
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.760]   Ukraine and Russia, he's never been to either. So, you know,
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.160]   just like Saks is going to go to Russia and Ukraine and get
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.520]   educated, you know, I came here to get educated so that I can
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   represent the pod better.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.680]   I've been to the United States. And so I know that the US
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.760]   shouldn't be involved there.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.080]   I'm joking with you, my friend. I'm joking. But we you know, I
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.200]   think we should go, you know, do more travel. And it's really
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.000]   inspiring to see what's going on here. On a very pragmatic basis,
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.160]   I will say, this is going to be the number two region, region
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.400]   and venture capital. And it's going to be that in 10 years,
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.440]   because I met with a lot of the family offices. And the family
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.120]   offices here are extraordinary. Like they built these businesses
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.640]   like really hard fought businesses 50 years ago.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.440]   Welcome to being a capitalist, Jason, I love it. The water's
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.920]   warm in this bathtub. Join us.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.240]   Well, no, the thing with these, these individuals is they're
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.600]   they're coming to the United States to invest in companies
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.880]   here. They're not just like the dough money at the table.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.440]   They are, of course, because they're smart business people.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.680]   We're all smart business people. We've always wanted to be in
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.640]   business. Nobody. It's what you said. Nobody was sitting here
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.440]   wanting to be some preachy know it all.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.360]   Yeah. So anyway, I'm learning a lot. I'm having a great time
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.200]   here. I don't have currently have any business business
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.520]   interests here. But I would say, you know, a year from now,
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:00.840]   there'll be, you know, a 12 episode run of this week and
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.080]   startups featuring folks here and then founding university to
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.240]   be here building companies with people in the region. So I'll be
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.920]   investing in some companies here and helping founders start
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.920]   companies. All right.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.720]   Saks, I
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.840]   get tell us about the speaker socks.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.120]   And let's not call it because he's third in charge. He's third
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.160]   in line for the presidency. So Saks, who is he?
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.240]   Okay, his name is Mike Johnson. He's from Louisiana's fourth
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:27.680]   district. He's been in Congress for since 2016. So his fourth
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:32.040]   term, he is in relative terms, a backbencher. Apparently, he's
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.600]   never met with Mitch McConnell, that may be a good thing. But
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.600]   several members had to Google him to find out who he was.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.000]   Really?
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.080]   Here we are. The good news, in my view, is that he did vote
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.680]   against more funding for Ukraine. However, as much as I
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.200]   like him on that issue, there are other issues where I think
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.600]   his previously stated views could be problematic for the
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.400]   Republican caucus. So he's very socially conservative. He voted
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:02.680]   to ban abortion at the federal level. He's called gay marriage
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:07.360]   a dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy that could do
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:12.440]   even the strongest Republic. On the issue of entitlements, he
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.320]   has expressed support for cutting Medicare and Social
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.800]   Security. I think Trump has rightly figured out that that
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.480]   would be death to the Republican Party, where he is aligned with
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.800]   Trump is that he bought into the election denial theories. And
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:28.680]   particularly, he bought into the Dominion scam that was pushed by
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.480]   Cindy Powell.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.960]   Shout out Cindy Powell, who is pleading guilty this week. Yeah.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.520]   The crack in the other crack. Yeah.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:40.360]   So was lunatic to muted of a word to describe this guy's
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.760]   facts? Would you say or would you?
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.520]   I don't think he I wouldn't say
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.960]   David, David, how did he get elected? Because I thought there
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:50.440]   was like more moderates that were like emers and even
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.000]   Scalise is more to the left of this guy. So how? How did how
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.280]   did is it that all of that ended up with the far, far, far right
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.280]   person getting elected?
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.960]   This is the crazy thing is that they had better choices. So for
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.720]   example, Jim Jordan is the guy who I think should have gotten
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.400]   it. Jim Jordan is always supremely prepared for any
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.640]   hearing. He's one of the only Republicans who knows how to ask
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.160]   tough questions. I think he would have run the house with
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.560]   tremendous discipline. This is a case where you're plucking a guy
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.000]   out of obscurity, he may not even have the experience to run
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.840]   the house with the necessary discipline. Moreover, he's
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.640]   somebody who the Democrats are going to write campaign ads
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.160]   against very easily. Now, you asked the question, how did this
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.680]   happen? I think that the GOP just kind of ran out of gas. I
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.120]   mean, they went through so many candidates that they exhausted
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.240]   all the options. And there were three weeks of chaos. And the
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.000]   New York Times summed up the feelings of the GOP caucus by
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.460]   saying, they view Johnson as someone who's sufficiently
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.760]   conservative, who they do not personally despise. So that's
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.960]   really the reason at the end of the day is they just perceive as
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.360]   a nice guy. But as you know, nice guys don't always get the
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.760]   job done. I think they were what is happening, they kind of ran
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.040]   out of candidates. And they chose this guy because he's a
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.960]   nice guy. Now Jim Jordan, this guy's a nice guy. He's a nice
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.160]   guy. He's a guy who believes gay people are evil. I don't I
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.040]   certainly don't approve of that message. But it comes from his
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.520]   religious views. Well done Republican Party. But look, Jim
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:23.840]   Jordan was the right guy here. But Jim Jordan sometimes has
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.920]   sharp elbows. And so he's rubbed people the wrong way. Mike
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.920]   Johnson, on a personal level, has not rubbed people the wrong
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.920]   way. But I agree that the campaign ads are going to write
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.760]   themselves here. He apparently hasn't rubbed anyone.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.840]   And then the crazy thing is that the one social issue gets
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.120]   crazier. Well, from my point of view, the one social issue or
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.320]   cultural issue where he's not that conservative, apparently is
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.040]   on CRT. He said a bunch of things that indicate that he
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.600]   views the US as being systemically racist and doesn't
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.560]   think Republicans should should be attacking CRT, which I think
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.880]   is the one cultural issue where Republicans should be on
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.120]   offense, they should be opposing the woke mind virus, I would
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.760]   like to see them go after that issue, and not be trying to
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.280]   re litigate gay marriage or abortion at the federal level.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.520]   So in my view, this, this guy is the wrong mix of cultural
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.440]   issues. And then of course, his views on entitlements are a
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.320]   surefire loser for the Republicans. So the Republicans
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.720]   are all like slapping each other's backs and sucking each
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.080]   other's so we're getting this done.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.400]   But I think it's a disaster.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.320]   Whoa, yeah, it's a disaster. How long does this last? How many
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.600]   days give me how many moochies? How many sacrilegious? Yeah, you
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.320]   give them seven.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.800]   Well, again, the Republicans now are so burned by the chaos is
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.600]   went through that I don't think they want to go back into it too
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.680]   easily. Wow. So I could last. Look, you're right. I don't
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   think I don't think he's gonna last long term. But But it may
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:11.560]   be more than a few scare moochies. Yeah. Shad scare
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.320]   moochie. 11 days. So yeah, that's 100 days. The scare
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.400]   moochie is a is a unit that equals 11 days. Yes. So you
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.360]   think like 10 scare?
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.240]   Yeah, I think you could get to you if you have to get to like
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.640]   January 20 of 2025, which is the inauguration. What are you
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:34.280]   talking about? 365 days? Right? Plus another? We're talking like
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.920]   70 days here. No, we're talking about 41 scare moochies to get
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:46.000]   to 1020. I mean, 40 scare moochies. 2540 and a wake up. Oh
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:46.840]   my lord.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.240]   So what you're gonna see is now that the media this already
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.720]   started, there's gonna be a drip drip drip of all the things that
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.080]   he's ever said when he was kind of a backbencher and almost
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.040]   paying attention. All these sermons that he's given and so
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.440]   forth. They're gonna be, you know, writing stories about
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.880]   that. And they're gonna make the guy seem like a wacko
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.840]   or expose that he is a wacko. I mean,
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:12.600]   well, I think that I would say that he's just somebody who's
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.600]   got very socially conservative views based on being
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.200]   evangelical, and
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:20.440]   might be wildly out of touch with Americans. Yeah,
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:24.240]   I don't want to like offend people in that group by saying
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.320]   he's a wacko. But I think you are right that it is not in tune
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.400]   with most voters. Let's say that
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.760]   hey, before we go, it's actually gonna ask you about the about
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.280]   the Trump cases. I mean, as a lawyer, what what do you think
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.120]   is gonna happen here? We have all of the cracking people have
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.520]   to answer the audience what happened?
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.080]   Well, I mean, I think everybody's following a Jenna
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:51.240]   Alice, Kenneth, she chez bro, it's spelled cheese, bro, but
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   it's chess, bro. And Sidney Powell have all now pleaded
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:58.160]   guilty, some of them for felonies, in fact, but the
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.320]   others misdemeanors, and they're all really apologetic about
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.160]   basically this fake electorates scam they were running to try to
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.880]   overturn the election. And they say there's six more of these
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.600]   19 people in the Rico case, we're gonna flip next week. At
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.560]   the same time, Trump was doing his case in New York and was
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.120]   fined 10k for violating this, the gag order the second time,
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.920]   third time, they think he's actually potentially put be put
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.360]   in jail, which seems to be something he's trying to do. So
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.680]   what's your day here, Saks? Is it all deep deep state
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.840]   conspiracy still January 6 up? Or were these lunatics actually
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.040]   trying to overthrow the government?
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.080]   To be honest, when you mentioned the name Jenna Ellis, all I can
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.320]   really think of is that election hearing in Michigan, where she
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:52.240]   made a face because Rudy Giuliani audibly farted. And
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.000]   then it turned out that that she got COVID a few days later, and
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.800]   that we think that Giuliani had it at the hearing. So he may
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.360]   have farted the COVID into her.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.080]   That's what we learned after all of this with COVID is that it's
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.200]   not it's actually is just
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.560]   flat. You could you could fart COVID onto somebody.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.400]   We got to go to a second science corner here, Freedberg.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.000]   We need an emergency science corner. Can you fart COVID into
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.840]   somebody's face? Please, Freedberg.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:26.480]   Can I come out your bum as well as your mouth? Come on.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.280]   We should we have put masks or diapers when we were on
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.760]   airplanes to block the COVID from we should have masked and
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.800]   we were masking the wrong place. Yes, Friedberg. I got him to
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.440]   smile. He almost left.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   Hold on. Put this on the screen. Yeah.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:52.640]   No, but she said she says the TLTR is unlikely, but that's not
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.680]   a no. It's not a no.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.360]   That's all the same as impossible.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:01.720]   Yeah. I mean, I can we get Fauci to come back? Shout out
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.480]   Anthony Fauci. He's got the answer for us. In all
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.840]   seriousness, this is they're gonna flip all these folks. I
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.000]   mean, this is like the end of Goodfellas here. Everybody's
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.400]   getting pinched. You think Giuliani's gonna get go to jail
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.040]   here? What do you think? How does this end, Zach?
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:23.320]   I think what's likely happening is that they're flipping these
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.480]   lower level figures in order to flip the next higher level,
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.120]   which would be Giuliani and Johnny Smith, because I don't
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.320]   think these people have anything on Trump. So they're going to
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:38.560]   try and, you know, use Jenna Ellis to flip Rudy, and then
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.560]   they're going to try and see if Rudy will flip on Trump. But
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.880]   this all begs the question of like, was there ever a crime
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.280]   here?
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.240]   Well, yeah, I mean, they admit and yeah.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.720]   Who's admitted to it?
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.040]   The three people who pleaded guilty.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.680]   And the closure because they don't have their lives ruined by
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:59.720]   spending their lives in criminal prosecutions that could send
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.880]   the jail. So obviously, they're going to cut a deal. But that
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.080]   doesn't necessarily mean that like, they're going to get the
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.120]   big guy here on some on some crime. And in fact, I remember
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:15.360]   when the TDS crowd was orgasmic over Trump's CFO flipping
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.600]   remember when Wesselheim
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.000]   Yeah, he's going to jail for six months.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.640]   Yeah, but remember when he supposedly flipped on Trump, and
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.440]   it turned out to be a big nothing burger, they couldn't
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:23.840]   get from
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:28.680]   Trump knows how to say stuff. He's just like, hey, maybe you
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.840]   guys could do something over here with the election.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.520]   Sex. I read that he walked out of the courthouse yesterday, and
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.200]   he got like a $10,000 fine for violating a gag order by
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.560]   second time reporter. It's so incredible. This whole thing.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.600]   How does a president of the United States who's running
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.160]   again for president of the right to say what he wants? That's
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:45.840]   crazy to me.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.760]   Well, no, they said it's the security of these individuals
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:51.600]   who's going after like the like, court reporter, like he's going
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:56.320]   in like the second person. What happens if he gets convicted?
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.520]   Does he miss the election? Is there some rule that says he
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.200]   can't run? What is the law?
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.840]   They don't know. That literally is unknown territory, uncharted
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.440]   territory, uncharted territory, just like the foreign Okay,
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.600]   everybody, just like the hot water in the ocean.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.400]   I think I was gonna get payback on Rudy for that fart. That
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:13.800]   COVID.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.160]   She flipped it and the fart.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:23.000]   All right, everybody. God, I mean, at least there's something
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.600]   to laugh about in this horrible, terrible. End of 2023. It's so
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.600]   depressing right now. I mean, it's just so depressing
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.400]   everywhere, isn't it? Let's pray for peace. And listen, this has
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:40.720]   been another amazing episode of the All In podcast, episode 151.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.600]   Let your winners ride.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.440]   Rain Man, David Sass.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:53.040]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:53.240]   it.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:53.880]   Love you.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.800]   I see no
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.160]   King.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:55.680]   Why?
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:03.560]   Besties are gone.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.120]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:15.480]   You should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.320]   because they're all just like this like sexual tension that
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.600]   they just need to release somehow.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:27.600]   What? You're a B. What? You're a B. We need to get merch. Besties are gone.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:37.320]   I'm going all in. I'm going all in.
