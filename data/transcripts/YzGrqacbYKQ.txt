[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   So let's say my weekly goal is to hire a new assistant.
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.220]   Okay.
[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.900]   Well, what's the most important next step on that?
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.100]   Well, I guess I got to put a job application out there.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.340]   Nope.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.940]   Not good enough.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.060]   We'll go, go deeper.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.860]   I need to open up my computer and write a job description.
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.180]   Can I go even more specific?
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.740]   I need to go to Google and Google assistant job descriptions.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.740]   I took a 10 year vision.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.200]   I went from 10 years to three to one to 90 days, or, you know, a quarter down
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.700]   to a week down to a day down to an action.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.780]   And every single morning I wake up and do the same thing.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.020]   So every morning of the week, I just wake up and I say, what is my most important
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.580]   step to accomplish the weekly goal every day?
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.220]   So I've taken a 10 year goal of buying $10 billion of real estate, and I've boiled
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.620]   the entire thing down to a 32nd task.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180]   Go to Google and type in personal assistant job description and hit enter.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.580]   My entire future, my family's future.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.820]   My generational wealth is all dependent on a 32nd Google search.
