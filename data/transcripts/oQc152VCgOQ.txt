[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540]   The complaint is like, "Oh, I'll build in this to make like a cylinder of glass or a rectangle of glass or whatever like that."
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.680]   It may not be super interesting from the outside, but if you're on like the inside of a building,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.520]   it's really nice to have a whole, you know, a large open space to walk through and to have like a lot of like natural light.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.020]   That was very hard to do prior to like, you know, the mid-20th century, and because for a couple reasons.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.860]   One is because buildings weren't really air-conditioned before that, and another one is like to have like big expanses of glass.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.640]   It's still expensive, but it was like even more expensive.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.680]   It basically became a lot more possible to just have like your building as like a big giant slab of glass and have like a lot of natural light.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.580]   It seems like it's maybe a case of the technology evolved such that you can create this nicer interior space to some extent
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.560]   that perhaps came at the expense of like having a lot of really ornate decoration on the outside.
