[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   A podcast listener named Kobe, who also keeps current on our blog at desiringgod.org it
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.520]   seems, writes in to ask this, "At the 715 mark in your sneak peek video in the Look
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   at the Book series, you connected the sacred writings in scripture, then made the jump
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.460]   to say that these inspired writings produce or yield faith in Jesus Christ for salvation.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.880]   But it seems that scripture here makes one wise for salvation through faith.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.280]   So faith is the means by which scripture produces salvation, not scripture producing faith.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.420]   So my question is, how do you take 'through' to mean 'produces' or 'yields'?
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.360]   How do you arrive at the conclusion that scripture produces faith from this text?"
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.280]   That's a complicated question.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   I'm sure the listeners are kind of, "What?
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.960]   What did he say?"
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.920]   So let me try to answer it in a way that clarifies the question, and I don't think it takes long.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   I really look forward to doing this more often, that if people see the Look at the Book, they
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   have another question, they call you, or they write to you, and we kind of tie together
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   Look at the Book and APJ this way.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   So let me give the verse.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.120]   Here's 2 Timothy 3:15, which he's asking about.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.840]   "From childhood, Timothy, you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.640]   make you wise unto or for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.160]   Now Coby says, "I think, the very words, it seems that scripture makes one wise for salvation
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.880]   through faith, so that faith is the means by which scripture produces salvation, not
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   scripture producing faith."
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.240]   Now Coby sees these as alternatives.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.440]   Either scripture produces or yields salvation, or scripture produces faith.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.060]   But I don't see them as alternatives.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.440]   Both are true, and both are essential.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.160]   The scripture makes us wise for salvation through faith.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.240]   Yes, faith is the means by which scripture leads to salvation.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   That's right.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.720]   And scripture does this by awakening and producing or yielding, that's the language I used in
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.800]   the LAB, faith.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.560]   In other words, if faith is essential to salvation, which it is, then if scriptures are going
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.040]   to lead to salvation, scriptures must do it by awakening or producing or yielding faith.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.160]   So Coby's asking, "How do you arrive at the conclusion that scripture produces faith from
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   this text?"
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.560]   And my answer is, it seems to me to be demanded by the wording.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.120]   Here's the wording again.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.580]   The sacred writings are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.560]   If the sacred writings lead us to salvation through faith in Jesus, then they must be
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160]   the means used by God to awaken our faith.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.120]   That is, they produce faith.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.520]   And then I find that confirmed in Romans 10.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.160]   Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.560]   So let me just close with one application beyond what Coby asked, because I think it's
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.040]   relevant here.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.220]   The sacred writings that Paul's talking about here that lead us to salvation and produce
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.520]   faith that brings us to salvation are the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.920]   These made Timothy wise unto salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.200]   That's amazing.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.060]   The Old Testament scriptures are designed by God to lead us to faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.360]   They're not an end in themselves.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.240]   Romans 10, 4, the goal of the law, and I think it means the instruction of God in the Old
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.400]   Testament, the goal of the law is Christ for righteousness to all who believe.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   This is how the scriptures make us wise unto salvation.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.560]   They prepare our minds and our worldview and our hearts so that when Jesus the Christ is
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.720]   proclaimed, we're ready, we are wise, and we believe and are saved.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   Yes.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
