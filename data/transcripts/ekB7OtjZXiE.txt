[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.820]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles in the seventh chapter, reading the first two verses.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.820]   The first two verses in the seventh chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.320]   Then said the high priest, "Are these things so?"
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.560]   And he, Stephen, said, "Men, brethren, and fathers, harken!
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.840]   The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.880]   he dwelt in Charon."
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.700]   Now, those who attend here regularly will know that we are looking at this statement
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.040]   for the third Sunday evening in succession.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   We are indeed engaged in the study of this great speech, sermon, statement, call it what
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.020]   you like, that was delivered by this first martyr, the first Christian martyr, Stephen,
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.240]   to the great court of Jerusalem, which is called the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.600]   Stephen was a man who was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.080]   He had been enabled to do wonderful works, and he was able to preach and teach to the
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   people.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.400]   And for this reason he had been arrested by this court, and charges, false charges, had
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.680]   been brought against him, the charge of blasphemy had been brought against him, the charge that
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.320]   he was against Moses and against the law and against the temple, those were the charges
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.880]   brought against him.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.720]   But above all he was charged with preaching the Lord Jesus Christ, for they said that
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.360]   they have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, namely
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.240]   the temple and Jerusalem, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.840]   Now, here we find, you see, Stephen appearing before the court, and the high priest who
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.480]   was chairing said, "Are these things so?"
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.280]   And Stephen begins to give his defense, makes his great statement, and it goes on through
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.720]   the bulk of this long chapter of sixty verses.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.560]   Now, why are we considering this?
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.000]   Is it that we are interested in ancient history?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.440]   Well, we are, but that isn't our reason.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.120]   We are interested in this because it is the first extended report that we have of a statement
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.040]   of the Christian faith, the Christian gospel, by one of the early leaders in the Christian
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   church.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.880]   Here I am trying to show we have put before us the very essence of the Christian message
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.400]   to the world, and it is couched, of course, in terms of the rejection by the Jews and
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.560]   their leaders as represented on this great court, and the reasons that they gave for
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.960]   their rejection.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360]   That is why we are doing this.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.120]   But why should we be interested even in stating the essence of the Christian faith?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   Well, there is no difficulty about answering that question, particularly on a night like
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.600]   this.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:29.200]   You see the kind of world we are in, an insecure world, an uncertain world, a world of calamities,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.360]   a world where we think we are in the midst of life, but discover suddenly that we are
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.400]   in death.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.600]   We are in such a world, and we are beset by problems round and about us, with which the
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.440]   ability of man at its best and highest can do nothing.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.400]   We are left staggered, helpless, astounded, bewildered.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.040]   The highest learning of the world doesn't understand.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.320]   Whenever you come up against the real, great, fundamental questions, human wisdom is always
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   useless.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.200]   Human philosophy has got nothing to say.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.680]   It just has to turn away to something else, to some pleasure of frivolity, some drinks
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.440]   and drug.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.560]   It doesn't understand.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.200]   Now that is why I am calling attention to all this.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.440]   There is only one message in the world this evening that can say anything to us of any
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.120]   value in the present position in which we find ourselves, and it is this gospel, the
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   message of this gospel.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   The world is bankrupt.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.440]   Here is the only answer.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.120]   But the tragedy is that men and women, instead of believing it and accepting it, and experiencing
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.520]   its wonderful consolation and comfort, and rejoicing in the hope that it sets before
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   us, the modern world, like these people 2,000 years ago, very nearly, these members of the
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.320]   Sanhedrin, the modern world persists in refusing it.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   And the reasons for refusing it are precisely those that operated in the case of the members
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   of the Sanhedrin.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.800]   Well, now, Stephen, you see, deals with all this, and that is what I am here to do.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.960]   I am just here to put Stephen's statement, Stephen's case, before you.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.000]   I've got no message of my own.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.880]   I'm simply an expositor, an expounder of this teaching.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.440]   That's all I've got.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.960]   My understanding and my wisdom is exactly the same as yours.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.440]   We are all equally helpless, but thank God here we've got a message transmitted to us,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.800]   coming down to us, which really deals with it in an authoritative manner.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.880]   Now, what is this message, then?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.240]   Well, we've been looking at it.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.520]   It's a message, you see, that starts with the word "hearken," "listen."
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.760]   In other words, as I expounded it, it means this.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.840]   You've got to take this message as it is.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.800]   You know, you can be seated in a chapel like this and listening to a man preaching without
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   listening, without hearkening.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.400]   There is a difference between just hearing words and hearkening.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.640]   "Listen for your life," says Stephen, "listen carefully, listen with an open mind.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.360]   For him has just been putting it very well, 'Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.'"
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.660]   Be careful, my friend, in your rash judgments and conclusions.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.640]   You don't understand God's ways.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.760]   Well, I say, "Hearken, be careful, wait a moment.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   There are aspects of this matter that you've never heard of.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.800]   God moves in a mysterious way, and our understanding is so small.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.720]   Hearken," says Stephen.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.320]   It's an appeal which he's making at the very beginning.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.480]   "Don't be prejudiced, don't be closed in your minds, keep your minds open.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.200]   Listen to what I've got to say, because," he says, "you've misunderstood, you've misunderstood
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.720]   your own religion, you've misunderstood your own history, you're so prejudiced, listen."
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.320]   And I would say the same this evening, "Keep your mind open, my dear friend.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.880]   Listen to what this message has got to tell us about God and his ways in this world."
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.560]   And then, I pointed out last Sunday night, he goes on to give this great review of the
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   history of the Jews.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.000]   He does it for some fifty verses, a great historical review, and we saw the importance
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   of that.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.160]   The gospel, you see, is based on history, not a mere theory, not a mere philosophy.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.960]   It's historical events and facts, and we must never forget that.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   And then we ended on this extraordinary note, "The God of Glory appeared to Abraham."
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.760]   The God of Glory.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   That's where the gospel starts.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   That's always the beginning of the gospel.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.640]   You don't start with men, you start with God.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.960]   The God of Glory.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.040]   Now here is this great message, "This God who has revealed himself to men, and supremely
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.580]   of course in the person of his only begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ."
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.400]   And we ended off with our reaction to that.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   Do we react as the men of the Bible reacted?
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.960]   Do we recognize, do we humble ourselves to the dust, admitting and confessing that we
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   are nothing and we know nothing, and do we just leave ourselves in his hands and in his
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.160]   mercy and his love and his compassion?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.880]   Very well, let's go on.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:44.960]   This is the message, "The God of Glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.240]   before he dwelt in Cairo."
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.680]   Now what does this mean?
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:59.360]   Well here it is, let me put it like this to you, "The God of Glory, Abraham in Mesopotamia."
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.760]   What does this mean?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well here is the very essence of the message, God and the world, and the relationship between
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.020]   the two, especially God's relationship to the world of men.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.080]   Now here again is something of course that is grievously misunderstood at the present
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.320]   time.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.960]   People feel that the Gospel is remote, that it's not relevant to the problems of the
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   modern world.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   That's why so many people dismiss it.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.120]   "It's an old fairy tale," they say, "you people interested in your personal salvation
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.360]   and the little ills of your own little spirits and souls, you small people, introspective,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.920]   morbid psychopaths, most of you.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.160]   What about the great world in which we live and the problems of mankind?
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.720]   Your message," they say, "is irrelevant to it."
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.700]   That's what they say, but I want to try to show you tonight that not only is that entirely
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.360]   and completely wrong, but as I've said already at the very beginning, I have a challenge,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.100]   and it is this.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.660]   There is nothing else that is relevant to our position as a world this evening.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.660]   Nothing else.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.440]   There is nothing else that speaks to our condition but this.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   It's the only thing that's practical.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.860]   It's the rest that is all talk.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:29.400]   How easy it is for men to talk, and they've been talking for centuries, the philosophers
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.040]   and the politicians, statesmen and poets and others, but what's the value of their talk?
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.040]   It comes to nothing.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.040]   It's they are the talkers.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.900]   If ever there was a practical message in this world, it was this.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.880]   That's why this history, you see, is so important.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.120]   Here is a message that has enabled people to be more than punkers.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.400]   Here is a message that has enabled men to stand up to life at its worst, and to go through
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   triumphant.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.560]   This is the record of the Christian saints.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.200]   They've been the only people who've really lived.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.120]   They're the only people who've known how to die as well as how to live.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.880]   There's nothing else.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.020]   Everything else is bankrupt.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:14.640]   So here I say, we are face to face with the actual situation in which we find ourselves
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.560]   as members of the human race in this world this very evening, the God of glory, Abraham
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.980]   in Mesopotamia.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.980]   Now what is this message?
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.800]   Well, I've tried to divide it up for you.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   Let's look at it like this.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.120]   First of all, let us look at the world of men.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:41.060]   Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, why do you think Stephen said that?
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:47.160]   Now this is the most important part of doctrine, this Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   What about him?
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.840]   Well, we know exactly what that means.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:59.280]   When Abraham was in Mesopotamia, he was a pagan.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.600]   He lived in a place called Ordo de Caldas, and as all the people there, he was a pagan.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.840]   They had their religion, they had their worship.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   What did they worship?
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.120]   Well, the chief element of their worship was the worship of the moon.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560]   They worshipped the moon.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:24.320]   As you know, pagans, they do worship the moon, the sun, the stars.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.480]   They have these various deities, the God of love, the God of war, others believe there
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   are spirits in trees, in stones, in brooks, and so on, and they worship this animism.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.280]   There are all these traditions, as you know, in paganism.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   Well now, Abraham, when he lived in Mesopotamia, was a pagan, and he was a moon worshipper.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:55.280]   This gives us an insight, you see, into the state and the condition of the world of men.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.360]   But of course, we no great deal beyond this.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.000]   You read it in the Old Testament history.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.280]   You read of a man called Cain, how in a spirit of jealousy he murdered his brother Abel.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.920]   That's the world in which we live, jealousy leading to murder.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.320]   And then you've got a terrifying description in the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   of the state of the world before what is called the flood.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.680]   Every thought of the imagination of men's heart was altogether and always evil.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:36.240]   You know the kind of life people were living before the flood, the horror of it all.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   The world is still like that.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.880]   And then you have the history of those cities of the plain called Sodom and Gomorrah, and
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.240]   the vice, and the filth, and the foulness.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.680]   That's men in the world.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   That's the story.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.640]   You get many other descriptions of it in the Old Testament.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   And there is an extraordinary description of it all in the New Testament in the epistle
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:07.120]   to the Romans in the first chapter, the second half of the first chapter, where Paul tells
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.040]   us, I was referring to the earlier part of this last Sunday night, how men in their wisdom,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   when God had revealed himself to them and they knew him as God, they turned their backs
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   upon him.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.880]   Becoming wise in their own conceits, they became fools and turned the glory of the incorruptible
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.480]   God into an image made like to corruptible men and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   creeping things.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.080]   In other words, they made gods out of these things and began to worship them.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.800]   And God gave them over to what is called a reprobate mind.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   Listen to this.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.240]   Here's a description of the world at many periods in its history, and it's true tonight.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.880]   For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections, for even their women did change
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.680]   the natural use into that which is against nature, and likewise also the men, leaving
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.080]   the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one to another.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.020]   Men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.200]   of their error which was meat.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:15.720]   On the description goes, filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:23.520]   full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.720]   proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.880]   covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful, who, knowing the judgment
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.360]   of God that they which do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.480]   have pleasure in them that do them.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.600]   That says, Paul, is the condition of the world apart from Christ, that's why I'm preaching
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   in it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.060]   That, I may say, is still the condition of the world tonight.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:02.000]   It is the condition of this great city of London, the great city of New York, the great
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.120]   city of Paris, with all our sophistication and knowledge and learning, that is how men
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   and women are living.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.600]   They're not only doing these things, they're gloating in it, they're glorying in it.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.400]   This is to be with it, to live like that.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.360]   Here's the state of our world.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.800]   It's still like this.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:29.040]   Paganism in Mesopotamia, worshipping idols, men and women are still worshipping idols.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.160]   They worship one another.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.400]   They worship their country, some of them.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   They worship their motorcars, some of them.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.360]   They worship their houses.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   They worship their children.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:46.080]   Nanni, here's the god, Nanni Mammon, one of the pagan deities.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.680]   The world is full of idol worship this evening.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.920]   This generation that rejects the gospel and regards it as insulting, they've all got religion,
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.000]   but those are their gods.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.280]   Paganism, Abraham in Mesopotamia.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.960]   But not only that, that's a description of the moral condition of the world of men.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.040]   But unfortunately that isn't the end of the story.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.320]   It is a world of illness and sickness.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.060]   It is a world of pain.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.860]   It is a world of calamities.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.280]   It is a world of accidents.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.340]   It is a world in which terrifying, awful things take place.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.720]   It is a world of famine.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.780]   It is a world of pestilence.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.360]   It is a world of death.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:41.040]   No, that's just an accurate description, isn't it, of the world of men, Abraham in
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   Mesopotamia.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.920]   That's how it was then, that is how it still is tonight.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:54.200]   And that is why we are here, because we're in a world like that.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.000]   And the question we all want to ask is this, and what we want to know is this.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Why is this?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.160]   Why are things like this?
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.600]   Here's the great question.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.120]   Can we do anything about it?
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   Is there any hope?
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.580]   Is there any consolation?
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.520]   Is there any way of escape?
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.800]   What do we do about this?
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.360]   Now, I'm here to say again that it is the gospel alone that really faces this problem
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.200]   and really deals with it.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.440]   There is nothing else that does it.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.520]   Well, let me show you how it does it.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.840]   Start with this first question.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.280]   Why is the world of men like that?
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.320]   Why were things like that with Abraham in Mesopotamia?
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:37.040]   Now, there are two main answers to this question, and there are only two, really.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   The non-biblical answer and the biblical answer.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.220]   You're familiar with the non-biblical, the natural men's answer to all this.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.480]   You ask him to explain why the world is as it is, and the answer he'll give you is this.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.320]   It is some kind of statement of the popular doctrine of evolution and the development
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   of men.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.640]   We are told, you see, that the whole world is an accident.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.520]   There's no mind behind it, no reason, things just have happened, the cosmos has come into
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.120]   being as the result of an accident.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:16.680]   But there is some kind of force, some power, some principle that is sort of pushing upwards,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   and it's produced men, who's better and greater and beyond everything in the animal realm
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.880]   and below him, in inanimate nature, but men, we are reminded, has only just come out of
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.600]   the jungle, he's only really beginning to liberate himself, and the processes are slow,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.760]   and it's taken millennia to come as far as this, and it'll obviously take many millennia
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:46.240]   more before men will truly arrive at a state of perfection and of complete development.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.880]   Well then you say, well all right, if that's the case about men, but what about these other
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.160]   things that happen in the world, the illness and the sickness and the disease, the calamities,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   and all the rest of it?
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.960]   Well they say that there is no answer to that, the whole thing is really a matter of accident
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.140]   and chance.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.320]   I'm telling you what they say, this isn't my caricature of what they say, I'm not being
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.200]   unfair to them, this is what they do say.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.920]   Your scientific humanists and even your classical humanists, they have nothing more to say than
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.600]   this, that the whole thing is a matter of accident and chance.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.120]   There is no purpose, they say, discernible in history anywhere.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.880]   Things just happen, we don't know where they are going, they may go up, they may go down,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   we don't know.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.240]   We are just in a world that we don't understand, and we've just got to make the best of it
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.360]   while we are here.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.600]   But you mustn't prophesy, you mustn't promise anything, we don't know.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.440]   It may turn upwards, it may turn downwards, the whole thing is a matter of accident and
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.680]   chance.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.920]   There is no comfort, there is no consolation.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.680]   This is the only world, this is the only life, and death is the end.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.800]   There is no proof of this, these are assertions, this is what they say.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:06.880]   It is the bankruptcy of men facing the problem of himself in a world like this without the
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.680]   biblical revelation.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   So I come to the biblical revelation, which is the second great answer to all this.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.160]   Why are things as they are, and as I've tried to describe them to you?
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   Well the answer of the Bible is this, that they were not always like this.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:32.440]   That the world was made perfect, and made perfect by God.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.280]   This is a view which tells us not that the world is gradually coming up from some primitive
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.800]   slime to modern civilization.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.240]   Here is a teaching that teaches us the exact opposite.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:52.440]   That the world is degenerated, that the world was originally perfect, paradise, God looked
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.160]   at it all and saw that it was good, there was no imperfection, there were no troubles,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.480]   there were no problems.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:08.120]   Men need never have died, there would never have been any illness, paradise, perfection,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.680]   nothing at all in the way of a blemish or anything going wrong.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.360]   Well then, why are things as they are?
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.760]   Well the Bible has got its answer.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.640]   It tells us that there was a rebellion in the angelic places, an unusually bright angelic
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   spirit rebelled against God in his pride, and he's called the devil.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.320]   He fell and a number of angels fell with him.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:41.940]   Now he is God's great antagonist and enemy, he hates God with all his being, and what
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.400]   he did was this.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:49.540]   He came to God's perfect creation, and he tempted the highest being in God's perfect
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:58.520]   creation, man, in the person of Eve, who led Adam to agree with her.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.620]   The temptation of the devil to defy God, and they did, they listened, they rebelled, they
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:10.600]   sinned against God, and in doing so they fell.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   Now this is the biblical explanation of why things are as they are.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.120]   Here is the first statement of the gospel.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.560]   You see, I say this again at the risk of being misunderstood, the gospel does not start
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.280]   with a statement, "Come to Jesus, come to this friend who is ready to receive you."
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.000]   Do you know why people don't respond to that?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.860]   Because they've never seen any need of him.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.120]   And they've never seen any need of him because they haven't started at the beginning of
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:44.960]   the gospel, which is the state of the world, and the fall of man, and the devil, this principle
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:51.040]   of evil that is here damning life, and dogging all our efforts to make a better world.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.560]   This is the sole adequate explanation.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   Now it's no use saying, "Oh, but you don't believe in the devil any longer, do you?"
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.400]   I do for this reason.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.960]   I can't explain the state of the world apart from him.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.680]   What about your explanations about the development and the evolution, where's the evidence?
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.160]   It's on the other side, isn't it?
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.520]   Very well, here now, then, is the first great explanation, but let me go on.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.120]   What then, you may ask me, is God's relationship to this fallen world as it is?
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.960]   Here's the question, here's the vital thing we need to know.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.920]   Well, the Bible is quite clear and unequivocal in its answer.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.360]   God is the maker of this world.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.960]   God is the owner of this world.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.280]   God is the sustainer of this world.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.920]   He keeps it going.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.160]   It would collapse without him.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   What if he held back the rain?
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.320]   What if he blotted out the sun?
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.560]   The whole thing would collapse.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.080]   Not only that, he is the governor of the world.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.320]   Not only that, he is the judge of the world.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.440]   This Abraham about whom we are reading and with whom we are dealing, he uttered that
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.080]   great phrase, "Shall not the judge of all the world do right?"
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.320]   God is the judge eternal.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.560]   Why do I emphasize that?
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.440]   Well, I have to do it because this is the thing that leads us to the explanation of
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.040]   why things are as they are in the world and with men tonight.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:29.600]   The world that you and I are living in is a world that is under the judgment of God.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.720]   If you don't understand that, you'll never understand the gospel.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.400]   It's not surprising people reject the gospel who don't understand this.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.080]   You see, they don't think deeply.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   They think superficially.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.680]   But you've got to come back.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.840]   And the first statement here is that the world is under the judgment of God.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.280]   Individual men is under the judgment of God.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.120]   That's why men, when he fell, was driven out of paradise.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.540]   That was a part of punishment.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.960]   You see, he disobeyed God and rebelled against him.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.160]   He no longer is allowed to stay in the Garden of Eden and just pick the fruit and eat.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   No, no.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.040]   He's to be punished and he was punished.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:11.560]   He was driven out and he's now got to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.920]   He's got to work and he's got troubles and problems and they came heaping down upon him.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.280]   He's spiritually dead, he's lost the face of God, and he continues to decline and decline
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.240]   and decline until he reaches that appalling condition that I've described to you prior
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.960]   to the flood.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.840]   But you see, this happened to all individuals in the world.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:40.280]   And the result is that the whole world is suffering as the result of the sin of men.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   Now, here is something which I want to put before you, particularly this evening.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.240]   We've all got in our minds, I'm certain, this terrible tragedy, calamity that's happened
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.160]   in South Wales on Friday.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.840]   And the question people are asking is why does this kind of thing happen?
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.240]   If God is God, if God's the God of love, why does he allow this sort of thing?
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.120]   These are the questions people are asking superficially.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:08.000]   They're judging the Lord with their feeble sense and jumping to their hasty conclusions,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.740]   not realizing what they're saying.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.800]   But wait a minute, here's the answer.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:20.080]   As the result of the sin and the rebellion and the fall of men, the whole world has suffered.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.440]   I mean by the world, no, not so much men, the animals have suffered.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.120]   Creation has suffered, everything has suffered.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.160]   We are told in the third chapter of Genesis that a part of God's punishment of the sin
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.600]   of men was that he cursed the ground.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.080]   And it is an undoubted fact.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.240]   Listen to Paul saying it, I read that portion from Romans 8 to you at the beginning in order
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.760]   that this might come out clearly.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:56.240]   He says the creature, that's to say creation, the creature was made subject to vanity, not
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.560]   willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.120]   You see the apostle said, I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.720]   to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   He says the earnest expectation of the creature, the creation, the animals, the flowers, the
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.040]   trees, everything, the earnest expectation of the creature, waiteth for the manifestation
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.800]   of the sons of God.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.920]   The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:36.480]   That's what happened in Abraham, the groaning of creation.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:44.160]   The calamities, the pestilences, the storms, the cyclones, it's the groaning of creation.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.440]   It wasn't like this at the beginning, it wasn't meant to be like this.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.440]   It is like this.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.840]   Why is it like this?
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.040]   Well, he says, it has been subjected to vanity, not willingly.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.980]   The creation didn't sin, it was men who sinned.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:04.880]   But because men is the Lord of creation, when he sins and falls, the whole of creation that
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.280]   is under him is involved in his punishment, is involved in his crime, and that is what
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.840]   the apostle is saying here in Romans 8, exactly as you have it stated in Genesis 3.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.660]   God cursed the ground.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.760]   Something has happened to the whole universe as a result of the sin of men.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:29.860]   My dear friend, you and I have never seen this world as it was originally.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.160]   There were no calamities in paradise.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.680]   The kind of thing that happened last Friday couldn't happen in paradise.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.920]   That is partly, you know, the result of the greed of men, money-making, not considering
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   consequences.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.880]   Even the houses they built in those valleys, they were not very wonderful to live in apart
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   from calamities.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.320]   Thrown together somehow, money-making in the last century and afterwards, that's not
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.920]   the only explanation, it's a part of it.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.680]   That's the sin of men, you see.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.120]   There was no disease in paradise.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.960]   There were no pestilences in paradise.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.560]   There was no death in paradise as it came from the hands of God.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.520]   No, no, these things were never meant to be, and they wouldn't have been.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.720]   Earthquakes and all these other things.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   This is creation.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.660]   This is nature, travailing and groaning in pain.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.720]   This isn't God's original creation.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   Well what is this?
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   Well, I say, here is the answer to the questions that people ask so glibly.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   They say, "Why does God allow war?"
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   You know the answer?
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   It's men who's produced war.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   God is allowing men as a part of his punishment to reap the consequences of his own folly,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   his own evil lusts and passions and desires.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   All that is untoward in nature and all that leads to suffering is a part of man's punishment
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   for his rebellion and sin against God.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   That's where they come from.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   And that is the answer to these questions that people put so glibly about spastics and so on.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   "If God is God allowed, why does he allow this?"
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   The answer is this.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   Why did man ever sin against a God who made a perfect world in which that kind of thing
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   need never have happened and would not have happened were it not for the sin of men?
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   All these things are the result of man's original sin and rebellion against God.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   And it's the explanation of them all.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   Very well, the world, then I say, is under the judgment of God.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   The God of glory and Abram in Mesopotamia.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   This world is under the judgment of God.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   But then I understand this.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   God's permissive will is seen in this world.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   God's allowing secondary causes to operate, that is what is called providence.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   The hymn put it behind a frowning providence.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   And providence often frowns.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   He hides a father's face.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   Yes, but remember, God is the God of providence.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   He's in control of the world, but he permits certain things to happen in it.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   He's put certain laws in nature, and these operate.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   And then, man has sinned. Well, God allows him, I say, to reap the consequences.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   You can work that out for yourselves.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   Whether those coal tips should ever have been put in that position where this kind of thing should happen.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   That's man, I say, not thinking about anything, but quick results, immediate returns, profits.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   God allows that.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Man says he can get on without God.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   And in prosperity, they have got on without him.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   To me, that's the great tragedy of this hour, I know that valley.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   I preached in that very town of Aberfan.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   And I know how God's cause has gone down there since the last war in particular.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   How men in this state of affluence, this affluent society, have turned their backs upon God.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   Where once they sang his praises, and met to pray to him, and to thank him for his mercy and compassion.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   They've turned their backs upon God.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   And are they right to complain now?
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   You see, my friends, we've got to think deeply about these things.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   God allows men to reap the consequences of his own rebellion and sin.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   He allows secondary causes to operate.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   And yet, and this is what I want to emphasize, he is still in control.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   Men sinned against him, has brought down this calamity upon himself and upon the world.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   But God is still in control.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   You get this thought right through the Bible.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   There is no better statement than that, perhaps, than in the 13th chapter of the epistle to the Romans at the beginning.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.720]   The powers that be are ordained of God.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.720]   Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil." And so on.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   He says that these justices, magistrates, kings, emperors, princes, he is the minister of God to thee for good, and so on.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   "If thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vain.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   For he is the minister of God, the revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   God, you see, has not allowed the world to run away, it's rebelled against him.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   He gives it liberty, I say, up to a point, but there's always a limit.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   God ordained governments, it's God who's done this.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   Government is not a human invention, it is God who taught men to do this.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   "The powers that be are ordained of God."
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   God has put a limit upon sin.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   He has put a check upon the evil consequences of sin.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   Romans 1 teaches that sometimes he withdraws the check.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   I believe we are living in an age like that now.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   He withdraws the check so that we see sin festering, fulminating, in all the foulness of its vile pus.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   That's God withdrawing the checks temporarily, but he's in control, and everything is under his control.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:17.720]   And you read the Bible, and you'll see God interferes in history, God intervenes in history, God breaks into history.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   He rises up when he sees a people like the Assyrians going to decimate his own chosen people,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   and he smashes them in a way that makes them look ridiculous, the interventions of God in history.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   It's all here in the Bible, and you can see it in subsequent history.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   But my dear friends, over and above all this, this is the important and vital thing, and the very heart of the Gospel.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   God's relationship to the world, the God of glory, Abraham the pagan in Mesopotamia.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   What is God's relationship? Here's the answer.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   God's redemptive purpose.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   Here's the very heart of the Gospel.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   Why did God appear to Abraham?
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   He appeared to Abraham because he wanted to tell him about his plan of redemption,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   the way of the restoration of his old world that had gone astray.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   This is the great theme of the Bible.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   That's why Stephen starts with it.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   Here's the beginning of it in a sense, although it had started before that, as I'm going to show you.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   But the God of glory appeared to Abraham when he was a pagan in Mesopotamia, and said certain things to him.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   This is the grand message of the Christian Gospel, God's eternal purpose of redemption and salvation.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   What is this message?
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   Well, I'm only going to give you the broad outlines of it tonight.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   This is a great Gospel, isn't it?
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   I say once more, the greatest sin of men in the church today is to reduce this glorious, infinite Gospel to something simple and almost cheap.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   Oh, stand back and look at it.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   Start with the God of glory, and look at men, Abraham in Mesopotamia.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   What is this message?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   Let me try and put it to you in general principles only this evening.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   What is this message of God's redemptive purpose?
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   Oh, thank God.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   Here is the first thing.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   This world is still God's world.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   I wouldn't be indisputable for that.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   This whole world as it is tonight, in all that is so true of it, it is still God's world.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   What's this message?
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   Why did God appear to Abraham?
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   Well, just to tell him that he hadn't abandoned the world.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   Though men like Abraham is a pagan worshipping the moon, though others are worshipping sticks and stones, and others worshipping beasts.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   Oh, God hasn't abandoned the world, he hasn't abandoned men.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   God is still concerned about this world.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   And this, I say, is our only hope.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   What if we're left to ourselves?
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   What if we were left to our own cleverness, our own devices?
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   What if the only hope for the world tonight were education and culture, and the arts, and all the cleverness of these men, who can even make jokes of tragedy?
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   What if he left us all to ourselves, and to fester in our iniquity?
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   We would be without hope, without God, in the world.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   But here is the message.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   God, the God of glory, appeared to Abraham, this God we saw infinitely different from men in sin and shame.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.720]   In all his glory, he's aware of this condition, and he appears to men.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   And he appears in order to tell men that he has a plan of redemption for this world.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   That's what he revealed to Abraham.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   That's what Stephen expounds in this great speech.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   But let me tell you the second deduction that I draw from this.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   That is the first, and oh, I feel like staying with it.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   You know, if I have nothing else to say tonight, this is the one thing that keeps a man on his feet and alive in a world like this.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   God is still concerned about this world.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   It still belongs to him.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   He's not abandoned it.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.720]   But listen.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   He's got a plan of redemption for it.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   And my second point is that this plan of redemption is entirely God's initiative.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   What do I mean?
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   Well, you notice how Stephen put it.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   He says, "Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   The God of glory appeared to Abraham."
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   God is the first mover.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   You see, the popular teaching today, of course, is the exact opposite of that, isn't it?
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   The popular teaching of today would have us believe that Abraham suddenly had an idea.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   That Abraham, as a thinker, began to work things out and said, "The moon can't be a god after all, because there's no person.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   It's impersonal."
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   So he worked it out, and as a result of a process of thinking and argumentation, he gave up paganism and arrived at a belief in this living God.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   That's the popular teaching.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   They call it comparative religion.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   They can tell you exactly how it's happened.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   How, I don't know, because they were not there.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   This is the theorizing that you see has turned into facts, and it's a lie.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   It's an invention.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   It's not true.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   But this is what we are told, that man starts in animism, then he goes up the ladder more and more and more, until he begins to believe in a personal God.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   And what we are told about the Old Testament is that it's just the history of this kind of ascent in men's idea of God.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   That the Jews got ahead further than anybody else and did so most quickly.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   That while all the other nations were worshipping a multiplicity of gods, the Jews arrived at a belief in monotheism, the one God.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   And so they arrived at that point sooner than all the rest, and then began to teach the others about this.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   That's the popular teaching.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   But it's an absolute lie.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   It's not true.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   The truth is the exact opposite.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Man started with a knowledge of the only true and living God.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   He fell away from it.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   And he went down and down and down into the depths and degradation of polytheism and paganism, animism, and all the corresponding life that was characteristic of such a belief.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   And there he would have remained but for one thing, what is it?
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   That God, the God of glory, appeared to Abraham.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   The story of the Bible is not the story and the history of men seeking God.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   It is the story of God seeking men.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   Don't you see it?
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   Even the moment men had fallen in the Garden of Eden. What do I read in the third chapter of Genesis?
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   This. Here is man. He sinned, the man and the woman.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   And they realize it, and they know they're naked for the first time, and they're filled with a sense of shame, and they cover themselves with fig leaves.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   Then suddenly they hear the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the evening.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   And they run in terror to hide behind the trees.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   What happened next?
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   They heard a voice.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   They heard a voice. What was it?
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   God appeared to Adam, even though he just rebelled and sinned, though he was a fool, though he was consumed and covered with his shame.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   God came down and appeared to Adam.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Adam, where art thou?
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   As he addressed Abraham later, he's here addressing Adam even in the midst of his sin and shame.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   My dear friend, I don't care how low you've fallen into sin.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   I don't care how vile you are.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   I don't care how black you are.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   Listen, this same God of glory is concerned about you and knows you.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   Listen to him. Be ready.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   Can you hear him calling you by your name and saying, where are you?
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   Come out of that shame. Let me speak to you.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   Here we've got it again in the case of Abraham.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.720]   But you see, this is the whole story of the Bible.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   Look at Jacob. Jacob was a great deal of a twister, wasn't he?
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   And he runs away from home because he twisted his own brother.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   And there he is, tired and exhausted, lies down to sleep.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   Can't find a pillow, gets a stone and puts his head on it.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   Goes to sleep and in his sleep, God, the God of glory, appeared to him and spoke to him.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   And Jacob wakes up and says, God is in this place and I didn't know it.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.720]   Of course not. He wasn't seeking God, but God was seeking him.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   And God knew all about him.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   Running away in fear and terror, in sorrow and shame.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   God, the God of glory, appeared unto him.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   Oh, this is the whole story of the Gospel.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.720]   Go back, go to your Gospels, look at the Gospel of Luke.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.720]   How does it start? Well, it starts like this.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   There was a man called Zechariah.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.720]   He was one of the priests and he had a certain duty to perform.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   And he went in one day to perform it as usual.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   Suddenly, he wasn't expecting anything.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   An angel appeared and a message and he struck dumb.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   What does he say when he regains his speech?
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   This is what he says.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.720]   God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   Same idea, God has appeared, God has visited.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   God has come down and knocked on our door.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   The door of the world, the door of humanity.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   God's paying a visit, God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   Go on to the third chapter.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   The son of Zechariah is called John the Baptist, comes on the scene.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   How is it introduced?
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Well, in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.720]   Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea and so on and so on.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   What happened?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   The word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   Not John as a student in a university struggling for years and years with books and learning.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   And arguing with philosophers and at last arriving at a solving world.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   No, no, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   In the wilderness without a book, without anything.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   God's initiative, God appearing, God speaking.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   And it's always the same, my dear friends.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   That whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   To redeem them that are under the law.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   Well, listen to the magnificent way in which Paul puts it to Titus.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.720]   In the second chapter, verse 11.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   Always disappearing.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   And it appeared in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   Well, listen to the apostle putting it again the same point exactly.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   To Timothy, here it is, without controversy.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   What is it?
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   Well, God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.720]   God has appeared in the flesh.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   Not in a word any longer.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   But God has come in the person of his son.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   God was manifest, hath revealed himself, has appeared, has come amongst us in the flesh.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   He tabernacled amongst us.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   He dwelt among us.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.720]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.720]   This is the message of redemption.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   The God who appears, the God who takes the initiative.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.720]   We owe it all to him.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   Why does he do it?
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   Well, I'll tell you why he does it.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   He does it for his own glory.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   Do you think that God can leave this world as it is?
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   God has this plan of redemption for his own sake, for his glory's sake.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   God can't allow the devil to triumph.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   He who's brought the world to this condition by fooling men, by beguiling Eve and she beguiling Adam.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.720]   Do you think that God can allow the world to go on like this?
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   It is unthinkable, it is impossible.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   God, for his own sake, his own name's sake, his glory's sake, he will not allow the devil to triumph.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   His own honor is involved.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   And so he has this great plan and purpose of redemption.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   But it's not his only reason for appearing to Abram.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   He's moved by his grace, by his mercy, by his compassion, by his love.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   He sees the misery, he hears the groaning, he sees the unhappiness.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   He sees what man has done to himself and the whole of creation.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   He sees the malignity of the devil, and moved by nothing but his own eternal love.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   And this grace which is favor and pardon shown to the utterly undeserving, he has done it all.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   God, the God of glory, has appeared to Abram.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.720]   It is all his initiative.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   And that is why he does it.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   And what is the purpose?
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   Well, here it is, here's the summary.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   This purpose of redemption is first a redemption for individuals.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   You can be saved out of this present evil world now, individually.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   It's a personal gospel.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   Abraham, an individual.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   Read your old Bible, God deals with individuals primarily.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   And he can take hold of a man and lift him out of the circumstances, out of the mess, the horror, the vileness of sin.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   And raise him up and make a new man of him and turn him into a saint.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   The Bible's full of it.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   Subsequent history is full of the same thing.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   There is a personal salvation.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   So even as things are in the world tonight, you as an individual, if you believe this message,
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   and believe that God has so loved you that he sent his only begotten son to bear the punishment of your sins,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.720]   and to die on the cross for you, and to rise again to justify you,
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.720]   you will be forgiven.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   And you will be given new life, and you'll become a new man.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   Though the world remains exactly the same, personally.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   But oh, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   There is a cosmic aspect to this.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   And we mustn't neglect it at a time like this.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   Because we are meeting under the shadow of a calamity.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:44.720]   And all these terrible things that happen in the world, there is a cosmic aspect, and we mustn't reject it.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   God appeared to Abram when he was in Mesopotamia, and you know what he ultimately told him?
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   He said this, not only that Abram was to be saved and made happy, he said,
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   "In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   There is a cosmic redemption.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.720]   Individual salvation, oh yes, but I like to look beyond it.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   There is a day coming, when this son of God, who already has done everything that is necessary
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   for our personal individual salvation, will come back again into this world.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   And what for? To destroy all his enemies.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   There is a day coming when the devil is going to be finally cast into the lake of perdition.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   He is already defeated.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   Our Lord defeated the devil in single combat when he was in this world in the days of his flesh.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   He has already conquered the devil and all his agents.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.720]   He has conquered death, he has conquered the grave, he has conquered all men's enemies.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   But he will come back, and he will finally destroy them out of existence.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   They will be cast into the lake of destruction forever and forever.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   And this old earth, this old world, yes, the very earth, will be changed and renovated.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   This whole cosmos is going to be purged of all the effects and results of evil and of sin.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   The lion shall lie down with the lamb, and the ox and the wolf shall feed together.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   A little child shall lead them.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   That's a part of this gospel.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   A new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   And all our enemies shall be finally destroyed.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   There shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more sin, there shall be no more death.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   Do you remember the statement that we have given in the book of Revelation in chapter 7?
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   Listen to this, my dear friends.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   In this world of calamity and death and sorrow and bereavement, listen to this.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   Here's this writer having his vision, and he looks on and he says,
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   "What are these things? A great crowd of people appear.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   And they say, 'Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   be unto our God forever and ever. Amen.'
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, 'What are these which are arrayed in white robes, and whence came they?'
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   And I said unto him, 'Sir, thou knowest.'
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   And he said to me, 'These are they which have come out of great tribulation
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   Therefore are they before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   And he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   Neither shall the sun lighten them, nor any heat.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   and shall lead them unto living waters, living fountains of waters.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.'
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:17.720]   No more sorrow, no more parting, no more death, no more grief,
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.720]   no more hunger, no more thirst, no more calamities.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   But the whole cosmos restored to its original perfection and yet more glorious.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   This is what is going to happen. It's a part of God's plan.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   The sun will come again and restore everything and head it up to its original glory.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.720]   And God shall be all and in all.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.720]   Oh, my dear friends, this is the message of the gospel.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.720]   And let me put it in the verse of the hymn.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   'Then the end, the church completed, all the chosen gathered in.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   With their clinking in glory seated, Satan bound and banished sin.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   Gone forever, parting, weeping, hunger, sorrow, death, and pain.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   Lo, her watch thy church is keeping. Come, Lord Jesus, come to reign.'
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   Thank God we are not left to ourselves, either individually or as a whole world.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   He's coming. He's a part of God's eternal purpose.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   I'll tell you again, God willing, how God, the God of glory,
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.720]   revealed this sort of thing to Abraham.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   The coming of the Son of God again. He's been once.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   He's done everything that's necessary for your personal deliverance and happiness,
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   here and now, with the world as it is.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   But eventually the whole cosmos shall be delivered.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   And you will reign in it as a king and as a priest with the Son of God.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   Come, Lord Jesus, come to reign. Amen.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.720]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
