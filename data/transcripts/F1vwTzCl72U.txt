[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.740]   that chapter that we have read at the beginning, the first epistle of Peter, the first chapter,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.940]   and I'm going to read again verses 10, 11, and 12, verses 10, 11, and 12, in the first
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.540]   chapter of the first epistle of Peter, "Of which salvation the prophets have inquired
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.020]   and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.020]   what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.640]   it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.320]   Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us, they did minister the things
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.820]   which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you, with the
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.680]   Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into."
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.580]   Now I read again that chapter at the beginning, as I did last Sunday evening, because I'm
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:18.660]   anxious once more to have a look at what this chapter tells us in general about the gospel
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.740]   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.300]   That is what the Apostle is doing, in a sense, in this chapter.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.820]   He is writing to people whom he doesn't know.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.080]   They were strangers scattered abroad, they were in different countries, and he was writing
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.940]   a kind of circular letter to them because they were experiencing a certain amount of
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.220]   trouble and of persecution, to strengthen them, to build them up, to give them courage,
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.140]   to enable them to face their problems and difficulties with fortitude.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.680]   And his method of doing that is to remind them of the basic fundamental truths concerning
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.260]   the Christian faith.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.380]   And it is because I'm anxious to do the same thing that I'm calling your attention to the
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.180]   message of this great chapter.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.820]   Now, last Sunday evening we were looking together at that first phrase in verse 13, "Wherefore,
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.300]   gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.340]   And I started with that for this reason.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.060]   There are many people, as I was showing last Sunday night, who won't even consider this
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.660]   message because they've come to the conclusion that it's just something emotional, sob stuff,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660]   dope of the people.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.220]   There are masses of people who believe that.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.940]   They've even stopped considering it for that reason.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.980]   Well, we dealt with that and showed what a terrible, tragic fallacy that is.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.660]   But that's not only the only difficulty with respect to the gospel.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.460]   More and more do I come to see that the difficulty so many people encounter with regard to this
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.540]   Christian faith, the reason why they're not Christian, is generally in the realm of the
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.300]   preliminary approach.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.220]   Because if you start on the wrong road, you can't arrive at the right destination.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.180]   Nothing is more important in life than beginnings.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720]   That's important in every realm.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.340]   It's the beginning that matters.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.300]   If you go wrong at the beginning, it's very difficult to get right again.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.460]   So we're here in the realm of things that are preliminary, as it were, introductory.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.940]   We're concerned, if you like, to change the picture with matters that are foundational.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.220]   And here now, this evening, we are directed to another difficulty that seems to baffle
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.220]   many people and to befug all their thinking about this Christian faith.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.100]   Here we are looking at people who are not in the position of having nothing to do with
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.740]   it because they say it's anti-intellectual or unintelligent.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.300]   The trouble with the people we are looking at now is this, that they start with a wrong
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.140]   idea and conception with regard to the content of the gospel, as to what it really has to
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.300]   say, and as to what it's about, or if you like, they start with a wrong notion as to
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.660]   what it is to be a Christian.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.260]   Now there are so many wrong ideas about this.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.180]   And many, I say, have never known the real truth about the Christian faith and have never
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.340]   experienced the power of the gospel.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.420]   They have never known anything of this joy of which the apostle speaks.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.300]   Did you notice what he says?
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.700]   He says of these Christians that their relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ is this, "Whom having
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:49.300]   not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice with
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.820]   a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.700]   They are not like that, because they've got this wrong, prejudiced notion with regard
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.260]   to what Christianity really is, and as to what it's all about.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.420]   Now I don't want to worry you with describing these false notions, but it's important that
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.020]   we should face them, and therefore let me just mention two or three of them.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.340]   There are some people who think, and who verily believe, that a Christian is a man who holds
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.420]   a certain general views and ideas with respect to life.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:34.500]   He's a man who believes in brotherhood, friendship, believes in helping people, and in doing good,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.060]   and things like that.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.140]   That is their whole idea of Christianity.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.020]   Christianity, they feel, is a point of view.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.100]   They're always talking about the Christian attitude.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.100]   You know, these are the people who are always asking this question, "What does the church
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100]   say about this?
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.500]   Is the church going to do this or that?"
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.380]   Christianity to them is just an attitude.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.740]   This is, of course, heard a great deal today because of this atomic bomb and so on, and
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.140]   there are people who seem to equate the whole of Christianity with just being pacifism.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.900]   Why doesn't the church speak about this?
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.500]   And some in the church do speak and give the impression that that is the whole of Christianity,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.740]   a constant protest against wars, and bombs, and fighting.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.260]   That's Christianity.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.020]   That seems to be the newspaper's notion of Christianity, doesn't it?
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.340]   It seems that it is the most prevailing and popular view of Christianity.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.700]   Well, now there's one.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.220]   Well, then there are others who don't quite say that, but their idea is that Christianity
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.300]   is just a code of ethics or of morals.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.540]   This is a great book which tells people how to live.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.540]   This has been a very popular view.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.780]   It was introduced very largely in the last century by Thomas Arnold, the great headmaster
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.820]   of the school at Rugby.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.620]   That was his notion of Christianity.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.700]   It's that which makes a man a gentleman, teaches him how to live and how to behave,
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.360]   questioned purely of morals and of ethics.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.820]   As you know, there are many who hold that view today.
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.380]   They say they have the vaguest, the slightest interest in the doctrines of the Christian
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.180]   faith, but they are very interested in its ethic.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.100]   And they regard Christianity as just a code of ethics and of morals, a great teaching
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.980]   which shows us how to conduct and to comport ourselves in this world.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.740]   Then there are others who view it in this sort of way.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.180]   They go beyond that, and they feel that to be Christian is really a matter of believing
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:47.200]   in God, and in occasionally giving expression to that by going to a place of worship, Easter
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.900]   Sunday morning, Christmas perhaps.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.740]   "Yes," they say, "I'm a Christian because I believe in God, and I believe in
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.740]   worshipping God."
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.220]   They may say their prayers regularly every day, and that's their notion of Christianity.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.220]   "You believe in God, and then you occasionally worship him in public, and you again do as
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.860]   much good as you can," and so on and so forth.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.380]   No, that's a very common notion as to what constitutes a Christian.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.740]   I'm not imagining these things.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.580]   These are things that have often been said to me.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.860]   These are the things that you so constantly hear.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.420]   Then there are others who would go even further and would say, "No, to be Christian means
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.760]   at any rate that a man has had some sort of an experience.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.460]   He's been aware of some other power that is greater than himself.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.700]   He's aware of a kind of power in the world that makes for goodness.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.340]   He doesn't know quite what it is."
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.260]   But there it is, a morality tinged with emotion.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.940]   That was how Thomas Arnold's son, Matthew Arnold, defined Christianity.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.260]   The son went a little bit further than the father.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.180]   The son wanted a bit of emotion.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.700]   He wanted a little feeling in it.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.060]   And there are so many in this position.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:14.220]   They say, "No, you're not Christian until you're aware somehow of the unseen, of this
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.780]   other power, not yourself, that makes for goodness," and so on.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.460]   It's still, you see, in the realm of something which is very vague.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.220]   Some of them would go further and say that you must have undergone some great change
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:36.340]   in your life, that you must be able to say, "Whereas I was once blind, now I see."
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340]   Something's happened to you.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.740]   There's been a change in your life and in your way of living, but they don't go beyond
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.740]   that.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.460]   Well, now then, there are some of the popular and the most popular notions with regard to
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:55.460]   what constitutes Christianity that are current at this present time.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.820]   Now I want you to hold those in your mind as we look at what the Apostle tells us here.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.360]   Because you see at once that all of them, separately, are all of them taken together,
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.540]   are totally inadequate and incomplete.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.500]   They don't justify the language that is used by the Apostle.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.860]   There is nothing about all that which calls upon a man to gird up the loins of his mind.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.620]   Did you notice the first verse, the first word in that thirteenth verse we were looking
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.620]   at last Sunday night?
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:35.220]   It is "Wherefore, in the light of this, gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.540]   Whatever else Christianity is, it is obviously something which calls upon a man to exercise
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.300]   all his powers, and especially the greatest of all, which is his mind.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:54.500]   "Gird up the loins of your mind," says this man, "because of all I've been saying.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.020]   Wherefore, in the light of this."
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.260]   So that as we come to consider what the Christian message and the Christian faith really is,
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.660]   it has got to satisfy that particular canon.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:15.120]   It has got to be something that calls out all a man's reserves, something big, something
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.440]   which demands his entire concentration.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.160]   I suggest to you that the definitions I've put before you don't come up to this test.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.180]   They don't call for that.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.180]   Why not?
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.380]   Well, I'll put it like this, they're not big enough.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.180]   Obviously from what this man says, and what the whole Bible says, Christianity is something
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:45.340]   great, it's big, it's grand.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:52.740]   It's called the gospel, and the gospel means good news, it's a proclamation, it's an announcement
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.740]   in the first instance.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.460]   You know, the gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't start by asking us to do something.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.860]   Before it asks us to do anything at all, it tells us something.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.820]   In the Peter ending of this great chapter, he says, "All flesh is as grass, and all the
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.820]   glory of men as the flower of grass.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.300]   The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the Lord endureth
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:25.120]   forever, and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.380]   It's a message, it's a proclamation, it's good news.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.820]   And as he points out, and as all these New Testament writers point out, it is thrilling
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:42.660]   good news, it's exciting good news, it's such marvelous and amazing good news that he says,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.420]   "Look here, gird up the lines of your mind, call up all your reserves, all your understanding,
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.420]   all your ability, because this thing that I'm putting before you, it's so great, it's so
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.740]   wonderful, it's so amazing, it'll take up all your powers and infinitely more."
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.460]   Now then, what is this?
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.100]   Is that our view of Christianity?
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:14.180]   Is it to us the most thrilling, the most glorious, the most magnificent thing in the world tonight?
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:20.100]   Let me put it like this, tell me, is your view of Christianity exciting?
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.940]   Do you know anything in the world tonight that is as exciting as your Christian faith?
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.900]   Do you know anything that gives you such a thrill, yes, such a kick, that rouses all
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:38.220]   your enthusiasm, that moves your heart, that draws out the greatest exercise of your mind?
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.220]   That's what it is.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.220]   Wherefore?
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:49.260]   Gird up the lines of your mind, because it is what it is, grand, magnificent, noble,
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260]   overwhelming, spectacular.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.660]   Well, what is this proclamation?
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.660]   What is this about?
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.460]   What is Christianity?
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.740]   What is this thing that leads to such a result?
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.980]   Now then, I'm taking these particular verses tonight because they answer the question.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:12.020]   They are the verses that immediately precede the word "wherefore," and this is the answer.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.020]   What is this?
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.180]   "Well," says the Apostle, "this is salvation."
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.060]   That's how he starts off, "Of which salvation?"
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.540]   He's already been talking about it, you see, he says in verse 9, "Receiving the end of
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.460]   your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.020]   Salvation.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.340]   He's already used the word in verse 5.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:42.620]   He says, "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.140]   revealed in the last time."
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140]   Salvation.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.300]   That's what it's about.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.580]   Let's take another word with it because the two go together and each one helps to explain
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.580]   the other.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.500]   Did you notice the word "grace"?
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.820]   "Receiving the end of your faith," he says, "even the salvation of your souls, of which
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.380]   salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.900]   should come unto you."
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900]   The grace.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.300]   Then we had it last Sunday night in verse 13, "Wherefore, God, up the loins of your
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:24.260]   mind, be sober and hope to the end, for the grace, the grace that is to be brought unto
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.500]   you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.420]   Now then, this is what Christianity is.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.780]   It's about salvation.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.540]   It's about grace, the grace of God.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.380]   And you know that's the theme of the whole Bible.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.620]   What is this great book?
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.500]   Sixty-six different sections in it, sixty-six different books if you like, what's it all
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.500]   about?
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.660]   Well, there's a common theme to them all, and the theme is salvation, the grace of God.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.860]   That's what this book is about.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.020]   It is the textbook of salvation.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.200]   It's the manual which teaches us about the grace of God.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.740]   It is the one theme of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.100]   It is what God has done about us men and about our salvation.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.220]   That's what it is.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.740]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:28.340]   This Christian faith, this Christian message, is not primarily just something which teaches
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:39.100]   us with regard to what we have to do in order to live a good life or in order to be better.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.980]   This I say is not primarily a teaching which comes to us telling us how we are to save
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980]   ourselves.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.220]   I'll go further, does this shock anybody?
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:57.860]   This is not a book which tells a man how he can make himself a Christian.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.860]   Nothing of the sort.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.660]   That's a complete denial of its message.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.100]   Well what is it then?
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:11.260]   Oh, the great theme of this book is to tell us what God has done about our salvation.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.280]   It is the grace of God.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280]   What is grace?
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.620]   Well grace is kindness shown to somebody who is totally undeserving of it.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.020]   That's what grace means.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.900]   Grace means unmerited favor.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.060]   And therefore the case of the Bible can be put like this.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:37.420]   That man in sin, as a result of his rebellion against God, is deserving of nothing but punishment
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.100]   and hell and suffering.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.220]   He has forfeited every claim upon God's love, but in spite of that, here is the message,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:51.340]   in spite of that, though we deserve nothing, God, because of his everlasting and eternal
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:57.420]   grace, because of the riches of his grace, has looked down upon us and has had compassion
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:03.820]   upon us and has done something to rescue us and to deliver us.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.220]   That's what grace is.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.500]   That's what salvation is.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.740]   Salvation means deliverance.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.540]   And the Bible, the theme of the Bible, is to tell us of what God has done in order to
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:23.700]   deliver us, of which salvation, of which deliverance, of which redemption.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.480]   Those are the terms that are used.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.940]   Man as he is by nature, born into this world, is a creature who needs to be delivered.
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.260]   He needs to be delivered from condemnation, from the wrath of God, from the world and
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.580]   the flesh and the devil, from everything that gets him down and makes him ashamed and unworthy.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.500]   He needs salvation, that is salvation.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.940]   And the great theme here is the way of salvation, of which salvation.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:02.420]   Now, the apostle's proposition is this, that this salvation which is proclaimed in
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:13.220]   the good news of the gospel, is something which is so great, so glorious, so wonderful,
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.420]   that a man needs to gird up the lines of his mind.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.060]   He needs the full position of his every faculty.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.260]   It's something that is going to exhaust all his capacity.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.300]   And when he said his last word about it, he hasn't begun.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:31.620]   It is so magnificent, so transcendentally glorious.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.620]   That's his case.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:39.460]   Well, now then, let's follow him as he tells us why it is like that.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.580]   What is there about this salvation that makes it so great and so glorious?
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.420]   Let me note to you some of the answers.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.740]   The first that he gives us is this.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.820]   It is God's plan.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:20:01.260]   He puts it like this, you remember, in verse 20, "who verily was foreordained before
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.540]   the foundation of the world."
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:13.540]   This is God's plan and God's way of salvation.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.260]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.060]   What's your view of Christianity?
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:24.900]   How have you habitually thought of this gospel?
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:31.420]   Had you realized, my dear friend, that this is something, I say it with reverence, that
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:38.860]   occupied the mind of the eternal God before there ever was a world at all?
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   Now, we are interested in schemes and plans and proposals for the world, aren't we?
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.100]   We are always waiting for something new, for something to turn up, for something to be
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.620]   thought of, something to be invented, that's going to relieve the situation a little bit.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:21:00.740]   I'm privileged to ask you tonight to look into something that was planned and arranged
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.900]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:10.220]   Now, we measure the greatness of things, don't we, very largely by the persons who produce
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.940]   them.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.020]   We are always influenced by names.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.420]   There are many people who can sing very well, but you don't listen to them all.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.780]   But if you hear that there's some outstanding singer, you want to listen.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.780]   It's the same with a painter.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:32.900]   The great names, ah, you say it's a Turner, or a Gainsborough, or somebody else, and you
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.820]   want to see it.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:41.580]   A great artist has painted this, and it's a very true and a very good test.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.620]   We all operate along that line, don't we?
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.500]   We don't want to hear the hack orators in the political arena.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.220]   We want to hear the big names, the great men.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   Quite right.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:00.480]   Very well, my friend, I take up your own standard, I take your own assessment of things.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.040]   I say you're right in going in for greatness, very well.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.420]   If you want something to think about, if you want something to grapple with with your mind,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.180]   if you want something that's going to exercise all your capacity as long as you live in this
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.340]   world and for eternity, consider this.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:29.620]   Here is something planned by the eternal God, the Godhead, Christianity, you say.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.860]   The average person says today they dismiss it.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.220]   They laugh at it, they're ridiculous.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.660]   Oh, they're interested in living life in this world, they say they want to be practical.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.580]   And this is, this old, no, no, they're not interested.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.460]   They want something, and I want the great philosophers, says the man.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.860]   My dear friend, I ask you, consider this.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:57.380]   This is something that is planned by the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.820]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:06.100]   Before there ever was a world, before there ever was a man, God in eternity saw the end
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.180]   from the beginning.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:12.980]   He saw that man would rebel and fall, and before man was ever made, he planned the way
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.420]   of salvation and of redemption.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.940]   And the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit were involved in it.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.780]   It's all in our text, you know.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.120]   We read about Christ here, we read about the Spirit, we read about the Father at the back
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.460]   of it all.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.580]   That is why this is so great and marvelous and thrilling.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:36.340]   Yes, the Apostle Paul, with his gigantic brain, he turns aside in writing to Timothy and he
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.980]   says, "Timothy, you know, great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.700]   Stand back," he says, "and have a look at it.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.340]   You are worried about yourself and about your churches and about what's going to happen
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.340]   and about the future.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.180]   Man alive," he says, "forget yourself for a moment.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.740]   Stand back and look at it.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.340]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:10.260]   God was manifest in the flesh," and so on, "which verily was foreordained before the
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.100]   foundation of the world."
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.220]   This is something that comes out of eternity, out of heaven, out of glory, down amongst
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.220]   men.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:27.980]   It's not a man standing on tiptoe trying to find a way out, it's God revealing, speaking.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.700]   What was decided in that eternal council between the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:40.820]   before time, before the world, before men, before sin, before anything, we are looking
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:51.060]   at and listening to something devised, planned, arranged by the everlasting God.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.260]   Had you realized that?
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.380]   Well, let's go on to the second thing.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.580]   The second thing he tells us about it was that it was prophesied and predicted.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:05.980]   "Unto," he says here, "of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently,
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.380]   who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:15.420]   time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when he testified beforehand
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:20.700]   the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow," etc.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.420]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.500]   You see how God works.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.300]   There, before time, he planned the salvation.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:37.340]   Then he began to make preliminary announcements about its coming into operation.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.340]   That's where your prophets come in.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.980]   That's your Old Testament.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.260]   It's nothing but one great prophecy.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.260]   What's it prophesying?
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.660]   Oh, it is the prophecy concerning the coming of this great salvation.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:58.700]   It begins, you see, in Genesis 3, verse 15, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   head.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:04.060]   God the Father himself made that proclamation in the garden of Eden."
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.940]   There it is.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.220]   Something tremendous is going to happen.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:18.100]   There's the first intimation, and on and on he goes, giving intimation about a scepter
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:27.900]   that shall arise in Judah, a Shiloh that is going to come, some root out of the seed of
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   Jesse.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.900]   Have you read your Old Testament, my friends?
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.380]   Let me commend it to you.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.380]   Don't get lost in the details.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.180]   Go back to your Old Testament, keep your eye on this element of prophecy.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.100]   You'll find every book in the Old Testament looking forward.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   Somebody's going to come.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.300]   A mighty salvation is going to be given.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.540]   They're all looking forward.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.420]   The prophets, the whole of your Old Testament, comes under this category.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.380]   And there it rises, perhaps, to one of its greatest heights.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.700]   In the book of the prophet Isaiah, in chapter 40, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   your God."
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   Why?
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.540]   Because it is coming, "Well, all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.140]   "Prepare the highway," he says, "let every valley be exalted and every mountain and hill
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.140]   be made low."
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.420]   "Make straight its paths in the wilderness."
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   Why?
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.660]   "Well, a great personage is coming, a deliverer is coming, a Messiah is coming.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.180]   Make straight, make the way for him."
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:31.020]   All flesh shall see the salvation of God.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.860]   And on and on they go, and the time gets nearer and nearer.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.140]   The prophets prophesied concerning this.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.740]   And you notice Peter's interesting way of putting it.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:51.620]   He seems to ask a question, he said, "Well, how did they ever know about this?
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:58.100]   How could these men, hundreds of years, in some cases even thousands, before the event,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   how could they know?
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.100]   How could they tell?"
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:05.420]   "Oh," he says, "the Spirit of Christ that was in them told them."
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.940]   This is revelation.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.260]   Do you doubt the being of God?
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.060]   Do you doubt the truth of Christianity?
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.340]   Well, go back to this great fact of prophecy.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.620]   Here you get it, I say, hundreds of years beforehand saying exactly what's going to
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.620]   happen.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.860]   How do you explain that?
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.300]   There's only one explanation.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.300]   It was revealed unto them by the Spirit of God.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.820]   That's revelation.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.820]   They were inspired to write it in the same way.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.580]   These men don't say that they suddenly, by looking into some crystal, had a view of
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580]   the future.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.580]   Not at all.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   God gave it to them.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.580]   God spoke to them.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.900]   They didn't know any more than we know.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:46.420]   Indeed, says Peter, very often they didn't understand what they were saying.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.820]   They were mystified by this.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.780]   The message was given to them.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.660]   And here was their great problem.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.420]   "Oh, yes," they say, "we can see some great Deliverer is coming, a mighty salvation
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.460]   is going to be given.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.900]   But when is it going to come?
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   Is it now?"
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   No, no.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.740]   The answer was it is not unto them, but unto us.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.980]   They did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:15.260]   the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:21.500]   Take a man like Abram, for instance, who lived somewhere about 2,000 years before the birth
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.420]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.540]   Do you remember the vision that he was given?
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.340]   He had a glimpse into the future.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.660]   He didn't fully understand it, but as our Lord Himself said, "Abraham, rejoice to see
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.100]   my day," he saw it and he was glad.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.460]   He didn't understand it fully, but he did understand this much, that in some distant
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:49.380]   future God was going to do this tremendous thing, was going to send his Son, was going
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.380]   to send salvation.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380]   He saw it.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   He rejoiced.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:59.700]   He wasn't to live to see the actual thing, but he rejoiced as he merely anticipated it.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:07.640]   Do you know what it is to rejoice as you look back upon it in its full glory revealed?
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.980]   That's why we need to gird up the lines of our mind.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.660]   This thing is so staggering in its immensity.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.940]   The prophets spoke of it.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:20.620]   They were told that it was coming, and they understood that it lay in the future, the
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.900]   preliminary announcements, and it gets nearer and nearer and nearer.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.220]   And then that brings me to my next point, which is this.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:36.900]   This great salvation planned before the foundation of the world, intimations given concerning
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:47.140]   it, long before it happened, then actually was achieved in time as the result of certain
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:52.660]   historical happenings.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.100]   These men are all saying it's going to happen.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:03.180]   Then when the fullness of the times had come, it did happen.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.380]   And you know, we are in this building at this moment because of certain things that have
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   happened in history.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.540]   Do you notice Peter keeps on saying this?
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.860]   He says here, "Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:22.700]   did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.820]   unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven."
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.140]   What is salvation?
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.300]   What is Christianity about?
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.940]   Well, it's about certain events that have been reported.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.620]   As a newspaper reporter puts his report in the paper, here is a report of something that's
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.620]   happened.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.300]   Christianity is a report about something that has taken place in history.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   Or take the way he puts it in verse 20, "Who verily was foreordained before the foundation
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:54.700]   of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you."
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.220]   Manifest.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.260]   No longer prophesied, but it's happened, it's manifest, it's taken place, the revelation
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.620]   has come.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.540]   Oh, this is a very vital part of my message.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:12.880]   God grant therefore that I may be given the ability to put it plainly and clearly.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.100]   Christianity, my dear friend, is not a philosophy.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.300]   It isn't but a teaching.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.420]   It includes that.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   But it's not merely that.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.660]   Do you know what Christianity is essentially?
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.780]   It is this.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:36.300]   It is the report, it is the record of what God has done in time and in history, in events
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.420]   of history, for us and for our salvation.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.780]   That is Christianity, and that is where it differs essentially from everything that is
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.280]   called religion.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.720]   All the others are but teachings.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:54.920]   Your Confucianism, your Buddhism, your Hinduism, your Mohammedanism, and all your cults, they're
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.040]   but teachings.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.120]   This is not primarily a teaching.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.060]   This is a report.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.460]   This is a factual account of something that has literally taken place.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.680]   We are concerned here about events and about facts in history.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.080]   I'm not here to argue opinions with you tonight.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:19.640]   I'm here to report to you certain things that have happened, that God has done.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.760]   These things, says Peter, that are reported unto you by them that have preached unto you.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.660]   Well, what is it that has happened?
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:36.940]   Let me tell you, it's all about a person whom he calls Christ, searching what or what
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:43.260]   manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:51.740]   beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.620]   Christ, who is he?
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:06.060]   Here's the heart and center of Christianity, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.700]   To believe in God alone doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:15.720]   An Orthodox Jew does that, a Mohammedan does that, they all do that in a sense.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.340]   That's not Christianity.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:22.140]   To believe in God and to live a good life, why you can do all that without this Christ?
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.140]   What's Christianity?
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.300]   Christianity, by definition, is that which depends entirely, utterly, solely, exclusively
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:35.140]   upon Christ, this Christ, this person, this deliverer, this Messiah, Christ.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.380]   Who is he?
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:45.860]   Well, you see, it's all about that babe that was born in Bethlehem and that was put
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:51.620]   into that manger, called Jesus.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.820]   Jesus is the Christ.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.500]   That was the apostolic preaching.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.620]   That was the message.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   What's it mean?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:04.180]   Oh, what it means is this, and the world that is so looking for news and for facts and for
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:14.100]   something exciting has never realized this, that nearly two thousand years ago, the second
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:20.820]   person in the blessed Holy Trinity came down on earth to dwell.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:27.020]   Yes, that second person, who was co-equal and co-eternal with the Father, who had dwelt
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.060]   in his bosom from all eternity, he entered into time.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.980]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.900]   He entered into the Virgin's womb.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.980]   He was born of a woman, made under the law.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   Christ, that's what it is, the incarnation.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980]   It's a unique event.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.300]   It had never happened before.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.540]   It will never happen again.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.660]   This is unique.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:56.740]   This God, the second person, was made flesh.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:03.300]   He took unto him human nature, added unto himself human nature, which he took from the
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.980]   Virgin Mary.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.820]   Now that, I say, is the staggering, amazing thing.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.820]   You are interested in phenomena, in marvelous things.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.540]   You will run across the world to see striking things.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.540]   Look at this.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.540]   Look at that babe of Bethlehem.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.540]   Look at that person in the manger.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.540]   Do you know who that is?
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:22.580]   He is the one through whom the whole world was made, and without whom nothing was made
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.500]   that is made.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:33.900]   Christ, Christ, great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:42.620]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.900]   That's a unique event in history.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:53.020]   That's why you call this year 1959, because that happened 1959 years ago.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.540]   Oh, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.740]   The report doesn't end merely at the babe in Bethlehem.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:05.860]   It doesn't stop merely at the young man who worked as a carpenter for all those years
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.860]   there in Nazareth.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   It includes that, but it doesn't stop there.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.300]   Indeed, it goes on to tell us that at the age of 30 he went out and began to preach,
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.340]   and he staggered and amazed everybody, because though he wasn't a Pharisee and had never
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:22.340]   been to the schools, he obviously knew God and the law of God and the word of God better
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.340]   than anybody else.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.340]   He could confound all the doctors of the law, even at the age of 12.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.980]   Who is this?
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.100]   He is the Son of God, I say, here in the world, in the flesh.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.900]   He has made himself of no reputation and has taken unto him the form not only of a man,
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   but of a servant.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.900]   He has humbled himself.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.940]   Oh, but it didn't stop there.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.940]   You notice how he puts it, "The Spirit of Christ that was in them did signify when it
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:59.340]   testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ."
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.540]   He is talking about salvation, you see, and the mere coming of the Son of God into the
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.060]   world couldn't save us.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.980]   All his amazing teaching couldn't save us.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   We can't live it.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.700]   We couldn't even keep the Ten Commandments.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.100]   We can't even satisfy our own standards of conduct.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.540]   How could we follow him?
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.460]   He damns us by his example.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.700]   No, no, the sufferings of Christ.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.020]   What's the meaning of this table and the bread and the wine?
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.680]   Oh, the sufferings of Christ.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.380]   He commended it himself.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:33.180]   He said, "This must be done and be done regularly, because I came into the world in order to
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.740]   suffer the death of Christ, the crucifixion."
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.340]   The prophets kept on telling people that it was going to happen, not merely that he was
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:46.140]   coming, but that he was coming to die, to taste death for every man.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   That's what it's about.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.300]   That's what we are reporting.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.380]   That's the thing that has been preached unto you, says Peter, the sufferings of Christ,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   the Son of God who died in helplessness on a cross.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.580]   Why did he do it?
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.500]   Oh, it's because that's the only way of salvation, of which salvation the prophets
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   have written.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.980]   If he hadn't done it, there wouldn't have been salvation.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.820]   It's by dying he saves.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.420]   That's the thing that God planned in eternity.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.500]   "Who will go for us?" said the Father.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.020]   The Son said, "Here am I, send me."
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.020]   He volunteered.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.020]   He came.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.660]   He left the courts of glory and not only came into this sinful, evil world, he set his face
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.660]   steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.100]   He deliberately went to the cross.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.580]   He said he had come that he might die, the sufferings of Christ.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.640]   Look at them.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.760]   Look at him.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.300]   Do you want drama?
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.380]   Do you want your heart strings to be rung?
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:49.460]   Do you like to weep in cinemas and in theatres and as you read your novelettes?
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:57.220]   I ask you in the name of God, look at him, Son of God.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.300]   Look at him sweating drops of blood in a garden.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:06.580]   Look at him with a crown of thorns upon his holy brow and the blood spots standing out
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   upon him.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.540]   Look at his pallor, his pale face.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.620]   Listen to him crying out, "I thirst!"
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:20.660]   The sufferings of Christ, the agony, the pain, the suffering, the shame, the ignominy of
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:29.060]   it all, the sufferings of Christ, and he died, and they took down his body and buried it
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.060]   in a grave.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.820]   Why did he suffer?
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:36.180]   The answer is this salvation that God had planned.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.620]   It's impossible without that, but thank God I don't end the sufferings of Christ and the
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.220]   glories that should follow.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.900]   My dear friend, I'm but a little reporter, and you see I'm telling you some wonderful
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:55.060]   facts, I'm giving you news about how the Son of God left the glory and came on earth and
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.020]   was born like that, how he died on a cross.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:03.220]   Oh yes, and I want you to know this, there was a third mourning after they'd buried him,
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:08.460]   and you know they went to look for his body in the grave and it wasn't there.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.940]   He'd vanished, he'd disappeared, he was no longer there.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.660]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:24.940]   mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.500]   from the dead.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.860]   The glories that should follow, here's the glory, declared to be the Son of God with
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.700]   power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.660]   Here he is, one who seemed to be so weak, he's stronger than death.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.780]   Death couldn't hold him, he burst asunder the bends of death.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.460]   He arose triumphant o'er the grave.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.940]   He's the King of life, he's the King of death.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:55.420]   He can not only command the tempest and the storm and the raging of the wind, he battles,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.940]   he defies, he masters death.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.980]   He's conquered the last enemy, it couldn't hold him.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:10.740]   The glories that should follow, the glory of the resurrection, the glory of his glorified
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:16.740]   body as he appeared to his disciples, the glory of the ascension as they stood there
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:22.260]   with him on the hill and saw him ascending up into heaven, the glory, and yet he's
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.900]   revealed it later to others like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, the glory
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:34.940]   of his Godhead shining from his face, the glories that should follow.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.380]   These are the substance of the Christian message.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.980]   But it doesn't stop even there.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:46.540]   Did you notice this other fact? "Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves,
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:51.740]   but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:58.500]   have preached the gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven."
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.140]   Don't leave that out.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.540]   That's absolutely vital.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.820]   It was the last great action, the last great act in this series that were essential to
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:18.960]   salvation after he had resurrected and appeared for forty days and had ascended into heaven
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.220]   ten days after that an amazing thing happened in Jerusalem.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:30.420]   The disciples and other people numbering 120 altogether were met together in a room praying
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.820]   and suddenly there was a rushing sound as of a mighty wind.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   What was it?
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.580]   The place was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:45.180]   The Holy Ghost was sent down from heaven and as cleaven tongues of fire descended upon
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:50.660]   the head of the assembled company and they were transformed and transfigured men.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.300]   They spoke with new tongues.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   They had a holy boldness.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.900]   They were afraid of nobody.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.300]   These men who had been so cleaven hearted and spirited before, they are absolutely renewed.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.020]   They are filled with power and with authority.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:08.820]   A man like Peter preaches one day and three thousand people are smitten, convicted, converted,
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.900]   added to the church, become new men and women in Christ Jesus.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.900]   The Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.340]   That's one of the facts.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.900]   That's one of the things that we report unto you.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.900]   Well let me hurry on.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.680]   You know there's more to come.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.980]   This is why you gird up the lines of your mind.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   All that has happened.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   Have you looked into it?
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.980]   Have you considered it?
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.040]   There is yet something to come.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.380]   Wherefore gird up the lines of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:45.300]   that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.740]   I can only mention it.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:53.540]   He's done all that I've been talking about.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:57.100]   But he's going to do this other thing.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:04.740]   He's going to come back into this world, not as a babe of Bethlehem this time, but as king
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:10.780]   of kings and lord of lords, riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by his holy angels.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:18.620]   He's coming back to judge the world in righteousness, to destroy evil and sin finally, to set up
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.540]   the eternal everlasting state and kingdom.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   For it is to be revealed unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.300]   Look forward to that, says Peter.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:48.540]   Keep your eye on that, the grand, final, ultimate event which ends everything and leads to everlasting
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   glory.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.140]   There are the facts, there are the events.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.900]   My friend Peter's argument is this.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.940]   Gird up the lines of your mind, they're worth looking at, and you can't do it with a casual
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   glance, you know.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.140]   You can't be listening to the wireless and looking at this at the same time.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.220]   You can't half do this as you do so many others.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.940]   It wants all your attention, it's so vast, it's so big.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940]   Do you still doubt it?
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:19.180]   Well, says Peter, listen to this, which things the angels desire to look into.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:25.420]   They're so wonderful, they're so glorious, the angels, they dwell in heaven, they're
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:30.460]   always in the presence of God, they're always in the glory, they're familiar with greatness
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.460]   and glory.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.820]   But you know, with regard to this, according to what we are told here by the apostle Peter,
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.780]   they're looking at this with an intentness and an intensity that they've never displayed
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.780]   before.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:47.300]   They're stooping down, they're in a kind of leaning posture, they're looking over the
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:53.500]   ramparts of heaven to see this, these things that are reported unto you, which things the
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.660]   angels desire to look into.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.380]   Why?
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:12.780]   Well, because the salvation of men eclipses everything that even God has ever done.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:17.300]   These angels, you know, were there at the creation, they saw it all.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.860]   They heard the mighty shout, "Let there be light," and there was light, and they saw
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.220]   it happening.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:31.820]   Angels have been witnesses of all the great actions of God, but they've never seen anything
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.260]   like this.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.140]   This transcends everything.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.660]   This is the acme, this is the ultimate even of God.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:44.340]   Listen to Paul putting it in writing to the Ephesians in chapter 3, verse 10, "To the
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:50.620]   intent that now, unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:58.820]   by through the church the manifold wisdom of God."
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:04.180]   May I say it with reverence, the angels in heaven are nudging one another.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.540]   They say, "Look at this.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.860]   Have you ever seen anything like this?
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:17.580]   This is beyond everything, the sun, the brightness of the glory.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.180]   Look at him walking across the face of the earth.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.240]   Look at him lying in a manger as a helpless babe.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.880]   Look at him as a little boy.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.740]   Look at him working with his hands as a carpenter.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.180]   Look at him setting out to preach.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.180]   Look at him.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   Look at people jeering at him, mocking him, "He whom we worshipped always and before whom
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.900]   we veiled our faces."
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.860]   Men are laughing at him, and are spitting in his face, and think they can trap him and
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.860]   catch him.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.860]   They try to get rid of him.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   They plot against him.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.900]   They decide to kill him and to crucify him.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:51.900]   And they do.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:52.900]   Look down.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.700]   God, the creator, the sun, the everlasting word.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.700]   Look at him.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   He is dying.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.060]   Have a look at it."
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:05.620]   Which things the angels desire to look into.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.300]   And then they say, "Why is he doing it?
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.980]   Why should this ever be allowed?
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.300]   Why has this ever happened?"
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.900]   When they hear the explanation, they are staggered more than ever.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:23.800]   He is doing it in order to save men and women.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.300]   He is doing it in order that those who have rebelled against him and his father and the
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:34.260]   blessed spirit may be redeemed and rescued and ultimately glorified.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.820]   Have a look at it.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.060]   Even they are amazed at it.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:49.300]   Are you now surprised that Peter said, "Gird up the loins of your mind"?
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:55.060]   If angels are looking into it with amazement and astonishment, where do we come in?
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.740]   "Gird up the loins of your mind," I say.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.020]   Wherefore, in the light of all this, look into it?
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:07.100]   My friend, let me ask you a question as I close.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.380]   Have you looked into it?
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:16.500]   What does this amazing, astounding thing, which the angels are stooping down to look
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.620]   at, what does it mean to you?
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.140]   Have you ever really faced it?
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:28.360]   Do you ever think about it?
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.460]   Do you ever survey it?
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:37.180]   Do you ever look on at it with amazement and astonishment, this thing that amazes the angelic
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.260]   hosts?
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.700]   What is it to you?
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.820]   Does it mean anything?
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:53.620]   Or can you say that it amazes you, it thrills you, it astonishes you, it fills you with
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:59.500]   a gratitude that you cannot express, and your one desire is to look more and more and more
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:04.380]   into it and to understand it and to delve into the mystery, that you may rejoice in
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.820]   it and behold it with wonder?
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.820]   Which is it?
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.940]   Now, there need be no discussion about this.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:22.900]   If this thing which astonishes the angels and which they are so anxious to look into
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:30.580]   means nothing to you, there is only one explanation of it, and that is that you are suffering
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:37.660]   from a total blindness, a total blindness.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:44.240]   You cannot realize these things without being moved to the depth of your being.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.060]   So if you are not moved, it just means that you cannot see them.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.580]   And that is because you are blind.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.540]   If our gospel be hid, says the Apostle Paul, it is hid to them that are lost in whom the
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:03.380]   God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest they believe the
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.460]   glorious gospel of Christ.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:11.900]   They have never seen it, they are blind.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.580]   And you know not to see.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:24.860]   The only salvation means that you remain lost and blind and helpless, and will do so throughout
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:30.420]   all eternity.
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.860]   Have you realized what Christianity is, my friend?
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.020]   You see, it is not just being a good man and doing a bit of good, and helping people, and
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.740]   being kind and brotherly and friendly, and objecting and protesting about the atomic
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.420]   bomb, and about war.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.140]   You can do all that and be an infidel, and there are prominent infidels in this country
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.460]   today that are doing that.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.620]   I am not surprised at them, that is the extent of their belief.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:56.900]   I am not surprised that Bertrand Russell and company do that, of course, they have got
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.900]   nothing else.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.100]   But that is not Christianity.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:06.020]   There are many good, moral, decent people in the world who know nothing about these
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.020]   things.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.460]   What is a Christian?
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:18.020]   A Christian is a man who believes these facts, who sees their meaning and their significance,
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:24.380]   and who rejoices in them and in them alone, who is able to go through this world with
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:31.100]   his eye on a glory that awaits him, and of which nothing, nor hell, nor men, can ever
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.960]   rob him or despise him.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.180]   The angels desire to look into them.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.500]   Have you looked into them?
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:49.660]   As you value your immortal soul, I plead with you, look at them now, realize that the Son
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:54:00.540]   of God came into this world to die for sins, and believe that he died for your sins.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:05.780]   And if you do so, you can take it from me, your sins will be blotted out as if you had
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.240]   never committed them.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:14.940]   You will become a child of God, and you can look forward with absolute assurance to entering
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:20.700]   into that glory in the presence of God, and spend your eternity there.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.700]   Look into it.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   Don't waste a second.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:29.540]   The thing that ravishes the minds of angels, guard up the loins of your mind, look in,
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.700]   believe, accept.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:40.220]   Give yourself to him, and then go and tell the whole world about these things that I
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:46.020]   have had the privilege of reporting to you this evening.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.880]   Amen.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
