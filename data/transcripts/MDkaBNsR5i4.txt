[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   Andrew in Naples, Florida asks, "Pastor John, do your pro-life convictions change
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340]   when it comes to situations involving rape, incest, or matters of a mother's
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.200]   life?" These are hard questions. Do your pro-life views change in these
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.160]   circumstances? Well, they are hard questions, and by hard I don't necessarily
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.280]   mean hard to answer. I mean hard to live with. In other words, and the women here
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.880]   are the ones who bear the greatest weight because the baby is in her, not in
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.000]   the boyfriend or the rapist. And this is why it's so troubling when
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.720]   abortion is justified for equality's sake, which is what our president says
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.160]   repeatedly, which just galls me, that he would say in front of his daughters that
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.720]   for women to have equal rights, they have to have access to abortion, which really
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.440]   means equal rights to have sex outside marriage without any more consequences
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   than the boy has. That's what he means, which is horrific to say, but that's
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.880]   that's another question. The question asked is, when a woman has been
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.240]   attacked or say, broken at a party or something, and now she's pregnant, didn't
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.000]   want to be pregnant, it's going to change everything in her life. The guy was
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.560]   either an ugly brute or a manipulator, and what should she do? And my answer, as hard
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.880]   as it is, is that the baby didn't do anything wrong. And we're asking that the
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.040]   baby be penalized here, as well as the mom, if there's an abortion. And so I
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:04.240]   would say, no, rape and incest ought not to be a warrant for killing the baby. The
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.320]   baby's not the criminal here. The guy needs to be criminalized, not the baby.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.280]   And here I would add this, as horrific as that is for a woman who is raped, say, and
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.040]   now a pregnancy totally outside her plan and desire. I read the other day on a
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.840]   survey, I wish I could remember where I read it, that in a survey of hundreds of
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.920]   women who had carried a baby to term, who had been conceived in that kind of
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.960]   situation, virtually none of the women regretted it. Whereas many of the women
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.000]   who got an abortion felt pangs of regret. Here's the reason, I think. When the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.800]   horror begins to die down of what just happened, and that this baby in her was
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   conceived in that kind of ugly and hostile way, she still says, "It's my baby.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.840]   It's my baby." Just as if her husband had conceived the baby. Yes, it was conceived
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.040]   by a man who she didn't want to have anything to do with, but it's her, just
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.400]   like it would be her if it was conceived by her husband. And she feels that
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.120]   deep down, and I would just say there are ways forward, either with her
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040]   caring for the baby or giving the baby to a loving family who would raise the
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.480]   baby, because she's in a situation where she can't, that would be less damaging to
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.360]   her soul than if the baby were taken. Pastor John, how about in the situation
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.480]   of a mother whose life is at risk because of the pregnancy, what would you
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.160]   say to her in that case? Yeah, there are issues there that are
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.640]   really difficult, and it takes a doctor to be able to point out the nature of
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.160]   some of these risks. For example, the little bit that I know, there are
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, where the baby cannot live. The baby is outside
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.680]   the womb, the baby is alive now, the baby cannot grow in that kind of situation,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.160]   and if you leave it, it could imperil the mother's life. Now in that kind of
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   situation, it seems to me you're forced to ask, with a certain death of the baby
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.280]   taking the mom with the baby, what would you do and how would you, I would just say
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.040]   no, we don't want to lose two here, better to lose one than two in that case to take
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.320]   the baby from a situation where the baby cannot possibly live and could
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.800]   kill the mother while the baby's dying. With regard to other situations, like the
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.680]   mother's health is, say she's got cancer or something, and the doctor says, you
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.120]   know, to carry this pregnancy through could imperil your own life. Many women
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.240]   have said, and I think rightly, I'll risk it. I don't want to take my baby's
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.280]   life for the possibility that I will lose my life, and some women have lost
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.720]   their lives in childbirth and many times they haven't, and so I don't
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.960]   think it's obvious then that every risk that a mother is put in warrants the
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.560]   baby's life being taken, and where that line is between this is a certain death
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.520]   for mom, that's really tough and I'm going to have to lean heavy on the
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.360]   wise and Christian doctors, I hope, to help me discern, really, is this a death
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.200]   sentence for mom or is it not? And this gets down to that whole issue of what
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.600]   risks are appropriate and what aren't, and I'd rather just leave the
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.320]   principle there that it's a beautiful thing that a mom risk her life for the
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.120]   sake of her child, but a sure death sentence, I don't think, would be
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.000]   required of a mom. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
