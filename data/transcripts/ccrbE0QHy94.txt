[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.200]   for everyday life.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.060]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.520]   School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.680]   My guest today is Dr. Karen Parker.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.860]   Dr. Karen Parker directs the social neurosciences research program at the Stanford University
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.280]   School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.400]   The goal of her laboratory's research is to understand the biological basis of social
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.500]   functioning at every stage of the lifespan.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360]   So this includes the bonds that form between infant and parent or parents, as well as the
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680]   bonds that occur between children as they grow up, which of course, form the template
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040]   for social functioning when we become adults.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.560]   Dr. Parker's research is heavily focused on autism, and indeed on all forms of autism
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.240]   spectrum disorders.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.400]   Today we discuss autism, we talk about the prominent theories and current understanding
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.280]   of the biological basis for autism, as well as what still remains mysterious and unresolved
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.040]   about the causes of autism.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.580]   You may have heard that the incidence or perhaps just the diagnosis of autism has dramatically
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.060]   increased in the last 10 to 15 years.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.520]   And today we discuss why it is, in fact, that the incidence, not just the diagnosis, but
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.080]   the incidence of autism has so dramatically increased.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.480]   And perhaps most excitingly, Dr. Parker shares with us brand new research findings from her
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.220]   laboratory that point to a new understanding of what causes autism, as well as a novel
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.340]   treatment for autism.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.320]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.120]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.760]   about science and science related tools to the general public.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.880]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.920]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.360]   I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.680]   Now, a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.960]   asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.800]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.680]   has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.980]   One of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.200]   times, at the beginning and throughout, and at the end of your night when you wake up,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.960]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   And that's what Eight Sleep allows you to do.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.560]   It allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.640]   that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.200]   refreshed and energized.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for almost three years now, and it has
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   dramatically improved the quality of my sleep, so much so that when I travel and I'm at a
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.320]   hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my Eight Sleep, I very much look forward
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280]   to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my Eight Sleep mattress
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   cover.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to get $150
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.440]   off their pod three mattress cover.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.040]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.200]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.160]   That means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte, sodium, magnesium,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   and potassium.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.100]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.880]   your body, but especially your nerve cells, your neurons, relies on electrolytes in order
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.440]   to function properly.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.760]   So when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   your system, your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.360]   I drink one packet of Element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.640]   up in the morning, as well as while I exercise.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.360]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise, I often will drink a third Element packet
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.840]   dissolved in about 32 ounces of water.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.920]   After I exercise Element comes in a variety of different flavors, all of which I find
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   really tasty.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   I like the citrus.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   I like the watermelon.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   I like the raspberry.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.800]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint, which I find tastes best if they are put into
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720]   water dissolved and then heated up.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.000]   I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.880]   hot days and in the summer and spring months, but also in the winter when the temperatures
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.700]   are cold and the environment tends to be dry.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.240]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element, spelled L-M-N-T dot com slash
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.400]   Huberman to try a free sample pack.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.920]   Again, that's drink element dot com slash Huberman.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.800]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.300]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee, but is in fact a much better
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.800]   way to make coffee.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.920]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago, and I've been using one ever
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   since.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.440]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built the so-called Aerobie Frisbee, which I believe
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.280]   at one time, perhaps still now held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest throne
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   object.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.040]   And I used to see Alan, believe it or not, at parks around Palo Alto, testing out different
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   Aerobie Frisbee.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   So he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.280]   that turned into commercial products.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.600]   Now, I love coffee.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.240]   I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day, usually about 90 to 120 minutes after
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.080]   I wake up in the morning, although not always.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.000]   Sometimes if I'm going to exercise, I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.500]   But I love, love, love coffee.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.800]   And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.280]   tasting cup of coffee.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.720]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress that allows the same beans to be prepared
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.200]   into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of brewing
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.940]   that coffee, even the traditional French press.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.400]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.880]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels, even on
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   planes.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.220]   I take it for some hot water and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.060]   If you'd like to try AeroPress, you can go to aeropress.com/huberman.

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.140]   AeroPress ships anywhere in the USA, Canada, and over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.740]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.020]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Karen Parker.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.020]   Welcome.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.020]   Thank you.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.020]   It's great to be here.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.140]   This is going to be perhaps one of the longer conversations that we've been able to have
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.440]   over the years in part because whenever I see you on campus, we're heading in our respective
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.700]   directions, but I'm very excited because the topic of autism is one that is on a lot of
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.700]   people's minds.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.520]   And I think the first question that always comes up, it seems, is whether or not the
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:07:00.500]   frequency of autism is indeed increasing or whether or not the field of medicine is getting
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.760]   better at detecting what was always there over time.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   Do we have any clear answers to that?
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.200]   Well, I think it's a multifactorial answer.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   So we're getting better at detecting autism, right?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.940]   So in the past, we were diagnosing kids at nine or 10 years of age, right?
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.860]   And now clinicians are able to reliably diagnose kids at two to three years of age, right?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.180]   So there's more people.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.900]   There are pediatricians have autism screeners now.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.020]   So when you bring in your baby and over the first couple of years of life, you're filling
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.580]   out screeners that are looking for autism symptoms, right?
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.420]   So there's just a lot more awareness around autism.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.420]   But the rates have increased to now one in 36 US children have a diagnosis of autism,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.860]   which is over two years ago.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.360]   It was one in 44.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.060]   So one in 36.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   Wow.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.180]   I feel like it was just yesterday when it was one in 80.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.940]   But is one in 36 the average across boys and girls?
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.980]   Does it skew differently if you look at just male births versus female births?
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.980]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.180]   So autism is male biased and prevalence.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.900]   So you have, and again, the studies vary.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.140]   I mean, it's worth noting that autism is a highly clinically heterogeneous disorder,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.020]   which means that if you've met one kid with autism, you've met one kid with autism, right?
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.780]   So we have to bear that in mind as we have this conversation.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.780]   But different studies show that about for every one girl, there's three to four boys
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.660]   that are impacted by autism.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.220]   So there's differences in the prevalence rate and also there's different monitoring sites.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:46.260]   So the way in the US that these data are generated is the CDC has 11 monitoring sites across
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.260]   the country.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:53.020]   And so they follow children and then that's where we, that's where the prevalence rates
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.020]   come from.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.880]   And they release new prevalence rates every few years.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.220]   So if physicians are able to detect autism early, say in a two year old or a three year
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:09.780]   old, to imagine that they're working off of tests that don't rely heavily on language
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.220]   because even though you can get some verbose two and three year olds, most two and three
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.100]   year olds don't have a very extensive vocabulary.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:27.620]   And I'm guessing that they're also relying on things like visual gaze among other things.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.200]   We've already made clear that this is not a discussion to allow people to diagnose themselves
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.520]   or others.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.160]   But with that said, what are some of the diagnostic tools that people use?
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   Is it language?
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.460]   Is it vision?
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.120]   Does it present as abnormal auditory processing?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.820]   Maybe you could give us a sampling.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.920]   So autism is a behavioral diagnosis, right?
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   So unlike other areas of medicine where you might be able to take a blood test or there's
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.440]   other sort of tools, it's all a behavioral diagnosis by an expert.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.060]   So usually a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.820]   And they look for two core features.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.380]   So this is based on the DSM-5.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.020]   And the two core features are pervasive social interaction challenges and the presence of
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.420]   restricted repetitive behavior.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.620]   But there are a lot of people with autism who have anxiety.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.980]   There are a lot of people with sensory challenges.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.500]   There are a lot of people with seizure disorders, sleep disorders.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:38.940]   So again, each person with autism has this sort of unique collection of traits.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.500]   And that's how they get diagnosed.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.980]   We're going to talk a lot today about interventions.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:50.240]   But how early are some of the behavioral interventions-- and I should just say any interventions-- introduced
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   nowadays?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.060]   So if someone brings their child to the pediatrician and they take one of these tests and that
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:04.220]   child is deemed as having autism, will the one-year-old or the two-year-old immediately
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.620]   go into behavioral interventions?
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.140]   So usually you need to have the diagnosis of autism.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.060]   And then there are behavioral interventions or a variety of different ones that are used.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:20.460]   There are some studies where because autism is highly heritable, you can have one child
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.700]   with autism.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.180]   And then if you have subsequent children, you're at an increased risk of having subsequent
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.180]   children with autism.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.500]   And these are called baby sibling studies.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.540]   So what you're doing is enriching the population of infants that you follow prospectively who
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.940]   are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.140]   And there are studies where some of those children are enrolled in behavioral studies
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.300]   even when they're quote unquote at risk.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:54.700]   I've heard before that parents in which one or typically both parents are, say, of the
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:02.440]   engineering, math-y, physics quote unquote hard science type are more likely to have
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.540]   autistic children.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.540]   Is that true?
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.100]   I mean, did that bear out in the data?
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:14.420]   If you look at profession or undergraduate major, does any of that correlate with the
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.740]   probability of having an autistic child?
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.780]   Well, what I can say is that there's been some studies.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.620]   So what we know is that autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.880]   population.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.300]   And there was a study and there's a couple different instruments that are used to be
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.500]   able to measure these autistic traits.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.320]   So there's something called the social responsiveness scale, and then that's a US-based instrument.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:43.680]   And there's an autism quotient that's a similar measure that was designed in England.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.700]   And what we know from work with the AQ is that individuals that are in intense STEM fields
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.200]   like engineering, physics, and math have a greater burden of autistic traits, even if
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.380]   they don't have an autism diagnosis.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.380]   Okay.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.680]   So that leads me to wonder whether or not this whole business of a spectrum is actually
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.400]   multiple spectra, spectrums, is it spectrums or spectra?
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.300]   Someone will put it in the comments on YouTube.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.300]   We know that for sure.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.300]   Please let me know.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.580]   I would like to know what is the plural of spectrum, spectrums, because when we hear
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.700]   the word spectrum, we think, okay, there's a spectrum of severity, right?
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.220]   And in fact, I have some experience with severe autism, not in my family, but where I went
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:36.080]   to undergraduate university, UC Santa Barbara, down the way from that school was the Devereaux
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.900]   school, which was a school which has been there for a long time that parents would send
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.440]   their kids if they were "severely autistic."
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.420]   It was actually where Dustin Hoffman went to study for his role in Rain Man.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.060]   And the kids who were really delightful, they used to come into town every once in a while
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.020]   to the coffee shop where I'd study.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.500]   And they would also continue on from there to Kmart, which is why the Dustin Hoffman
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.900]   character would say, "Got to go to Kmart.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   He would do that repetition."
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.900]   That's fascinating.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.180]   That Kmart was down the road from our college housing and the Devereaux school.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.860]   Those kids were literally in a away from home facility full time.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.540]   And I spoke to some of the parents at one point, and they were at that facility, meaning
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.860]   the parents had sent their children away to live there full time.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.180]   Of course, they'd get visits and they'd get visits home because they were, I suppose we
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.180]   could say, at the far end of some spectrum that made it, at least to the parents' idea,
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.140]   impossible for them to be at home.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.620]   Okay, now at the other end of the spectrum, if one is just simply thinking in terms of
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.820]   severity, I know people who have self-identified as autistic, that's how they've referred to
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   it.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.300]   So I feel comfortable saying that they've said, "I am autistic."
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.500]   And they seem pretty high functioning, meaning they have driver's licenses, drive cars, are
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.380]   in healthy relationships, and manage life apparently well.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.540]   They have some traits that, yes, I would agree, are a little bit different, so this is where
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.020]   we get into neurodivergence.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.920]   But I guess the point is, should we think about autism as on a spectrum, or given the
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.320]   fact that there are these collections of different traits, could there be a spectrum of severity,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:28.200]   also a spectrum of more stereotype behaviors, another spectrum that intersects with that
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.380]   that has to do with obsession with a particular topic?
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.740]   We could imagine that there are 50 or 60 different spectra or spectrums, I still don't know which
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.600]   one to say, and that when we talk about the spectrum, we're really talking about something
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.980]   that's in multiple dimensions, and not just one line that goes from severe to mild.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.020]   I mean, I think this is where understanding the biological basis of behavior would then
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.820]   allow us to be able to say, "Here's these different dimensions," but not understanding
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.880]   the biology, you're left with, "Okay, are we lumpers or splitters?
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.940]   How do we think about this?"
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:15.220]   Because autism is highly heritable, so there's about 40 to 80% of autism is genetic, so these
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:22.460]   vary wildly, but the common thinking is that the majority, about 50% of autism is associated
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.820]   with common genetic variants.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:34.180]   And so the way that we've always thought about this is that autism is largely an inherited
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.820]   polygenic condition, but what I mean by that is that you have a lot of common variants
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.900]   that are additive, and so if you think about this collection of common genetic variants
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.940]   that underlie the spectrum, so if you have less of a dosing of some of these common variants,
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.140]   you might see somebody who's higher functioning, like you said, and if you end up with one
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:03.340]   of these single gene, highly penetrant disorders, you might see severe intellectual disability
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.940]   and sort of lower functioning on the other end of the spectrum, but I think that there
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:13.500]   is a lot that we don't know, and what you're bringing up, I think, underlines an issue
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:20.000]   with autism, which is common for many brain disorders, which is if you don't understand
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.140]   the underlying biological basis, it also gets very difficult to diagnose and treat, right,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.380]   and that's where we are with a lot of different psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:37.020]   To date, has there been any specific neural network that we can point to and say, "Ah,
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.460]   that's the neural network that seems to be different in people who are on the autism
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.460]   spectrum."
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:49.020]   I saw a study published recently that seemed to point to the idea that the genes that are
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:55.920]   altered in autism at least include a large number of genes that are altered, or the proteins
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.020]   that are the consequence of those genes are altered and exist at the synapse, at the connections
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.220]   between neurons, and I'm asking it that way because some years ago, I was at a talk on
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.080]   autism at Stanford, and someone raised their hand and says, "Do we even know that autism
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.720]   is a brain issue, right?
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.140]   Couldn't it be an issue of the immune system or the cardiovascular system?"
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.720]   Which at the time seemed like, "Okay, gosh, of course it's a brain."
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.860]   But wait, then you stop and you think, "That's a really good question.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.460]   How do we know it's a challenge of the brain?"
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.460]   Right.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.460]   I think that's a great question, right?
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.280]   And there may be people talk about autisms, right?
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:37.700]   And so when you think about where the major player is, we're at the infancy of thinking
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.700]   about this, right?
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.020]   And so maybe for some people, it's more of a brain-based disorder.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.300]   Maybe for some people, it's the connection with the gut and the brain, right?
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.100]   I think what's also really tricky, right?
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.100]   So one thing that you have to ask is, what are the barriers to progress in understanding
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.140]   autism, right?
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.100]   And so the way I think about this is that, let's just take for a moment that this is
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.840]   a brain disorder.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.860]   How do you study it in people, right?
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:10.100]   So it's very difficult to get access to either cerebral spinal fluid, which is a fluid that
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.860]   bathes the brain, brain tissue biopsies.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.900]   It's very hard to get people, especially children, that are really impacted into a brain scanner,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   right?
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.900]   Because they can't sit still.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.900]   They may have sensory issues.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.580]   They don't want to go into a scanner, right?
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.780]   So a lot of the tools that neuroscientists or psychiatrists have to think about looking
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.440]   at the brain are limited, right?
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.180]   And then the other part is, how do you model?
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:43.700]   So the other way we might think about getting access or thinking about model systems, what
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.660]   we need to do is think about the control animals, and we need to make sure that the species
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.580]   that we're modeling them in has features of control humans, if you will.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.140]   So we need to have complex cognitive abilities.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.500]   We need to have complex social skills.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.780]   We need to have an organism that has vision as its primary sensory modality, right?
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.540]   Potentially sleep consolidating.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.540]   So we need to think about all of those.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.860]   And the tricky part, I think, until fairly recently was that we were doing all of this
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:21.300]   work in mouse models and the control mice just fundamentally lack many of the characteristics
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.620]   that are needed to model autism with fidelity, right?
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:33.700]   And I think that's, when we look at drug development pipelines, about 50% of preclinical failures.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.940]   So that would be something that's tested in an animal that works and then fails in a human
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:44.180]   clinical drug trial, 50% of those failures can be attributed to poorly selected animal
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   models.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:51.340]   And so I think part of where we will be getting traction is picking, developing sophisticated
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.540]   models as a sort of point of entry into being able to understand some of these things that
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.620]   are really difficult to study in people.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.300]   Yeah, that's such a key point.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.700]   And for those that have not heard of preclinical models, preclinical models are non-human models.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.140]   So it could be mouse, could be non-human primate, could be flies or worms for that matter.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.660]   But we're going to talk a lot about non-human primate preclinical models and the work that
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.820]   you've been doing.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.080]   And of course, also the work that you've been doing in humans, the other animal.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   The other primate.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   The other primate.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   Right, exactly.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.140]   I love to remind people that we're primates, old world primates.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.460]   And thank you for doing that.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.480]   So you've been talking about the genetic influences on autism and of course, genes in the environment
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.740]   interact, right?
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.080]   It's never nature or nurture.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.780]   It's always an interaction and that isn't just about the epigenome.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.460]   It's also just about the fact that nature impacts the genome and our genome impacts
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.280]   the way that we interact with the environment, et cetera.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.180]   So what is the role of the environment in autism, both the frequency and the presentation
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.180]   of autism?
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.180]   Right.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.700]   So, I mean, there are, again, lots of different epidemiological studies.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:04.720]   So advanced parental age, prematurity, severe prematurity as a risk factor for autism, maternal
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.240]   illness during pregnancy.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.680]   So there's a bunch of different things that have been associated with an increased risk
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   for autism.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.860]   In terms of environmental influences and how they can intersect with biology, one of the
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.260]   things that I was really struck by in the early 2000s that at least by my read of the
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.140]   literature hasn't really gone anywhere was this idea that was proposed by Pashko Rakesh
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:34.500]   who used to run the neurobiology department at Yale, expert in brain neuroanatomy and
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.700]   non-human primates and in humans, embryology, really a luminary of our field.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.920]   And he had a series of papers exploring how the migration of neurons during early development,
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.700]   you know, as you and I both know, but most people out there probably don't know because
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.860]   we haven't covered this in the podcast.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.620]   It's not typical dinner table conversation, you know, when you, when an embryo, when a
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.340]   human embryo is developing that the neurons are born at one location and they migrate
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.320]   out some distance to their final resting place where then they grow out their connections
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.920]   and connect with one another.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.840]   And that process of neural, neuronal migration is oh so critical for the eventual wiring
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.060]   of the brain.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.820]   And Rakesh had this idea that perhaps, and I really want to emphasize perhaps that the
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:24.560]   more frequent incidence of autism might be correlated with the increase in early prenatal
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.020]   ultrasound.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.020]   And he had these papers published in a number of really high profile journals including
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.140]   Prosthenia National Academy and Science and elsewhere showing that in a mouse model, if
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.520]   you do ultrasound, with each successive ultrasound, you got more migration errors, right?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.740]   So there's, to me it was a, you know, an interesting example of the environment, frequency of ultrasound
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.100]   and cell migration having some sort of interaction.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.020]   But it seemed like it never went anywhere.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.660]   It never got tacked to okay, you should keep in mind the number of ultrasounds that you're
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.660]   getting for your child.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:02.440]   And of course, ultrasounds are critical for pregnant women to get because they can stave
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.960]   off a number of developmental issues and they're super important.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.980]   But you know, we've heard about ultrasound, you know, within the scientific literature
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.180]   and then occasionally we'll hear other theories about okay, it's having two parents who are
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.700]   both engineers and then we'll hear, oh, you know, it's, you know, toxicity in the food
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   environment.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.660]   We've heard, you know, hypotheses about vaccines or the adjuvants that the vaccines are contained
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.660]   in.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:32.180]   You know, in that large cloud of theories, has anything really emerged from them?
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.180]   It's like okay, there really seems to be at least one major risk factor, environmental
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.340]   risk factor because I feel like all those theories come up, get some popular press,
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.040]   a bunch of papers are published, sometimes those papers are retracted like in the case
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.340]   of the vaccines, and then the theory kind of dies.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:57.780]   So is there any specific environmental influence on autism that we can say yes, there really
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.340]   seems to be something there?
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.180]   I mean, so it's a really spectacularly good question.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.300]   I think the tricky part about it is that every single person that comes into a trial has
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.020]   a different genetic background, right?
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.460]   And so until we can have these a priori stratified trials where you could then, you know, as
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.860]   a good scientist, you would only manipulate maybe one, two variables at a time, right?
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.420]   But when you're doing these large epidemiological studies because you can't, it's very difficult
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:30.460]   to do experimental studies, right, especially with developing children.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.580]   I think that's an incredibly difficult study to do, right?
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:40.100]   So there's been an interest in this field of there's these neurogenetic syndromes that
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:47.380]   have high penetrance for autism, which basically means that you could have a disorder or another
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.540]   genetic condition, let's say, it doesn't have to be a single gene, but that a lot of those
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.380]   kids tend to also get an autism diagnosis.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.940]   And so there's been work in like, so for instance, Fragile X is a good example, where because
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:05.200]   autism is so diverse in terms of clinical presentation, that let's say you have a medication
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.780]   that could work for a handful of kids in the trial, you may not be statistically powered
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.820]   to see it, right?
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.820]   So you know, the way I think about the autism world is there's so little we don't know.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:22.340]   So think about being in a dark room and you have a flashlight and you only see where you
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.880]   shine the light, right?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:30.460]   And so if you think about a very heterogeneous, genetically heterogeneous study, it's going
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.740]   to be very difficult to tease out these pieces because an environmental risk factor might
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.660]   be a driver for one kid, but not another, right?
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.600]   And so I think what we need to do is to have these genetically defined subgroups of individuals
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.560]   and then be able to test the gene by environment interactions or in this genetically defined
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.860]   group of individuals, can we test this certain medication to see if it's beneficial for this
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.660]   subgroup of children?
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   Got it.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:06.180]   So you mentioned Fragile X, which we know presents with autism-like symptoms in some
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.180]   cases.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:12.060]   And then I think of another disease like Timothy syndrome, a mutation in an L-type calcium
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.220]   channel, which for those of you that don't know what these L-type calcium channels are,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.340]   they're not just important for the function of neurons in the brain, they're really important
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.400]   for the function of neurons and other tissues, including the heart tissue, right?
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:30.760]   So kids with Timothy syndrome have cardiac issues and they have autism.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.440]   So I think it's important for us to kind of explore this a bit because in most people's
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.020]   minds kids with autism have autism and occasionally they'll have other issues, gut issues or heart
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.860]   issues or musculoskeletal issues, but we often think that that's the consequence of the autism,
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.000]   but oftentimes they have multiple things going on and the autism actually could be secondary
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.160]   or independent of the other thing that's going on.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.460]   So this is what leads me back to this idea of a spectrum.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:07.160]   Is it possible that what we call autism is actually 50 different disorders or 50 different
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.580]   conditions depending on what one wants to call them?
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.520]   What is autism really?
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.920]   How does it really center around, and I think here maybe it's useful to go, like do we go
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.980]   to the diagnostic criteria, like how do we decide if a child has autism if they also
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.320]   have a bunch of other things that are challenging them?
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:34.100]   I mean, I think that that's the $64,000 question, right, and again in other areas of medicine.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:39.220]   So if you think about, let's think about cancer biology, right, like decades ago somebody
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.800]   would come in with cancer and you would hit them with radiation and chemotherapy and that
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.600]   was the best that we could do, right?
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.700]   But with the invention of a lot of molecular tools, you can remove a tumor and you can
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:56.200]   do molecular profiling and even have personalized medications made, right, to attack that tumor.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:03.700]   And so what's really tricky when you have a behavioral diagnosis that's not biologically
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.660]   defined, you see a lot of heterogeneity.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.220]   So it's incredibly difficult, I think, to answer this question because we don't know
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.420]   how many kinds of autisms there are, right?
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.660]   Like there will be people who say if you have a disorder like Fragile X or Prader-Willi
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:28.020]   Syndrome or Timothy's Syndrome or a variety of these other conditions, there will be people
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.140]   – I've heard clinicians say, well, that's not really autism, right?
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.380]   That's a piece of Fragile X, right?
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:39.060]   But if it's a behavioral diagnosis and they meet behavioral criteria, it becomes this
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.800]   weird circular argument, right?
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:49.320]   So like until we really understand what autism is, I think that it's going to be very tricky
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.720]   to start, you know, sub-defining different aspects of the condition.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.860]   As we all know, quality nutrition influences, of course, our physical health but also our
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.980]   mental health and our cognitive functioning, our memory, our ability to learn new things
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.120]   and to focus.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.900]   And we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.320]   sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimally
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:19.080]   processed sources, as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber to support basically
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.600]   all the cellular functions in our body, including the gut microbiome.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:29.180]   Now, I, like most everybody, try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods, ideally, mostly
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.200]   from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.660]   However, one of the challenges that I and so many other people face is getting enough
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.160]   servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics that
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.480]   often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.400]   That's why way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.020]   And so I'm delighted that AG1 is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.220]   The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day is that
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.860]   it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.820]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.460]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.680]   If you'd like to try AG1, you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.120]   They're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.200]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman to claim that special offer.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.540]   Well, this is probably a good time for us to think about the work that you've done in
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:40.740]   terms of trying to tack the biology of social communication and behavior, right?
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:47.640]   Those things interact, not just language, but also behavior, to autism in humans using
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.560]   non-human primate models.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.380]   And then, of course, to also discuss some of the work that you've been doing in humans.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.780]   And we can't have that discussion without first having a discussion about two neuropeptides
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.900]   that I think most people have heard of, at least one of them, and I think there's a lot
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.840]   of misunderstanding about, but you're going to clarify that for us, which are oxytocin
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.220]   and vasopressin.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:15.900]   So before we dive into the important work that you've been doing on vasopressin in particular,
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:22.500]   but also oxytocin and autism, what are oxytocin and vasopressin really?
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   Okay.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.500]   So they're these small little peptide, they're nine amino acids long, so very tiny.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.460]   They only differ by two amino acids, and they're these ancient peptides that are hundreds of
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.340]   millions of years old.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.460]   And in almost any species studied, whether it's the current version, you might have vasotocin
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.020]   or other mesotocin, which are sort of precursor forms in other species, but they're highly
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.840]   evolutionarily conserved.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.660]   And they're involved in social behavior in pretty much any, it could be egg laying, it
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:59.460]   could be, but reproduction and social behavior across the phylogenetic taxes.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:06.020]   So house cats make vasopressin and oxytocin, humans obviously make vasopressin and oxytocin,
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.420]   and pretty much every other species that has to interact with and connect with other members
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.420]   of its species.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.420]   Especially mammals, right?
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.520]   So oxytocin and vasopressin are pervasive in mammalian species.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:24.800]   Do the different species tend to make oxytocin and vasopressin in similar brain areas and
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   tissues?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.640]   Yes, but not completely overlapping, but I think the thing that the beautiful mystery
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:38.400]   about these and the infuriating piece of them is that because they're so structurally similar,
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.960]   they can have similar effects.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.380]   And there's four receptors that they bind to.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.680]   So if you think about a hormone or a neurotransmitter, so oxytocin and vasopressin, if you think
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.980]   about them like a key and a receptor like a lock, and you have to put them together
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.620]   to open a door, open behavior, they can bind to these four receptors.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:03.600]   So it can be very difficult to disentangle which one is acting and at which receptor
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.900]   and where in the brain.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   Oh, so oxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar?
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   Yes.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   Interesting.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:15.720]   So where would you say lies their greatest output divergence, which is just nerd speak
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:20.020]   for, is there an example of something that oxytocin does that vasopressin doesn't and
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   vice versa?
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.020]   Okay.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.080]   So what's really fascinating is these two neurotransmitters or hormones were discovered
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.000]   for their peripheral effects, which basically means not in their brain, but somewhere in
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   their body.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.180]   And so oxytocin is involved in uterine contractions and milk let down and so was during lactation.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.420]   So people sort of always thought of it as the female hormone.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:50.980]   And then vasopressin has, at least in the peripheral system, has been involved in urinary
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.900]   output regulation, blood pressure.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:35:01.820]   And so we only knew about their physiological roles as sort of classic hormones for decades.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:08.600]   And what was interesting is these naming conventions are fascinating in medicine, right?
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.340]   So you could name a virus after where it was first found, right?
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.740]   Or it could be named after somebody who discovered the disease, like Alzheimer's for instance
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.000]   is a good example.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.260]   And what was interesting, oxytocin was only named once, vasopressin was named twice.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.360]   So it's either called arginine vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.300]   And so it had two different names.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.900]   And so as you can imagine, sometimes genes are named twice.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.260]   And so somebody in cancer is studying one gene and somebody in autism is studying another
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.760]   and they're not even communicating because they don't even realize that they've, at least
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.040]   historically now we have all kinds of gene annotation sites, so it's less likely to happen
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   now.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.480]   But what was fascinating is these hormones were named, oxytocin is Greek for quick birth.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.440]   So for decades, people only appreciated their physiological roles.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.160]   But there are neuroanatomists saying, "Hey, so these are both made, they're made in a
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.120]   lot of different places, but the action sort of happens in the hypothalamus where they're
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   made."
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.360]   And so there were anatomists that said, "Wait, these sort of project back into the brain.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.080]   What are these doing in the brain?"
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:18.300]   And one of my favorite historical stories was I had a mentor, a colleague who I didn't
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.500]   train with, but he was a real source of wisdom to me for many years, and his name's Court
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   Peterson.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   And he told me this wonderful story about this duke zoologist named Peter Klopfer.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.180]   And Peter was studying ungulates, so sheep and goats.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.800]   And he wrote a story, a paper, in 1971 called Mother Love What Turns It On.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.560]   And one thing about science is I love going back and seeing where do the pearls of wisdom
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   come from.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.360]   And so he wrote this and said, "Oxytocin is orchestrating all these events of motherhood."
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   And there are sheep and goats in particular that have offspring that are precocious, meaning
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.840]   they're basically born ready, within an hour they can run with the herd, unlike our species,
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.520]   which is altricial, meaning we have very helpless infants.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.940]   And mom needs to bond really quickly with that baby if it's going to be running around
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.400]   and you only, from an evolutionary perspective, you want to be investing in the baby that
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.880]   you're is not somebody else's, right?
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:22.360]   And he hypothesized that it was oxytocin that was being co-released into the brain and during
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.060]   milk let down, that was what turned mother love on.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.600]   And that was really the beginning of this whole field of thinking.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:36.700]   And so that opened up thinking about oxytocin in rodent maternal care and a variety of other
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.400]   instances.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.040]   Can I just briefly interrupt you because I find this so interesting and I know it's interesting
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:49.540]   to everyone listening as well because yes, and thank you for making it clear that oxytocin
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:55.440]   has many different roles, but this role of mother love and bonding to infant has me needing
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.800]   to ask whether or not the idea was that oxytocin is released in the mother when she interacts
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.640]   with her own baby.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:10.080]   And that leads me to the question, is oxytocin also released in the baby in reaction to the
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.080]   mother?
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.760]   And how long is that effect lasting?
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.940]   Because in order to have a pervasive bond with that baby and not just some other baby,
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.560]   and of course we still have visual cues and, you know, we know our baby versus another
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.720]   baby, most instances, there are rare exceptions or perhaps not so rare exceptions, but leaving
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:33.900]   those aside, you know, the mechanism that would allow for mother infant bonding and
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.820]   infant mother bonding by way of oxytocin presumably is something that is literally changing their
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:45.100]   brains saying it's, you are the, are the center of my life, right?
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.720]   And the baby of course is saying, well, you are my life because you are the source of
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   life, right?
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.040]   And certainly for the early part, early part of life in that nowadays it seems that that
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.700]   that can extend well into the teens and twenties for some people, but you know, how, how is
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.700]   oxytocin working?
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.320]   Is it, is it working over the course of minutes, hours?
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.700]   Is there some specificity of this baby and this mom that links them in some more pervasive
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.700]   way?
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.160]   I mean, how is oxytocin doing this magic of bonding?
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.760]   I mean, it's, it's very species specific, right?
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.840]   So I think that, and you need to think about like the evolutionary history of the species,
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   right?
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:29.200]   So if you think about sheep or goats, the early studies that were done are you, the
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.480]   passage through the vaginal canal was what, you know, so you had activated oxytocin receptors
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:40.360]   that way, but if you gave an oxytocin antagonist, meaning you would give into the brain something
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.880]   that blocked the oxytocin receptors.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.720]   So if the oxytocin is being released into the brain, but you have a pharmacological
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.180]   agent blocking its ability to bind to its receptors, these sheep and goats wouldn't
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.720]   bond to their baby for instance.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   So literally the passage of the baby out of the vaginal canal triggers the oxytocin pathway,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.120]   the release of oxytocin.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   Right.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   As in L-actation does too.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.900]   Nature is so beautiful because if you had to pick one event to trigger the release of
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:12.120]   oxytocin, if oxytocin's role is to create bonding with offspring, that will be the event because
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.920]   that's a tough one to mistake.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   Right.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   Right.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.440]   But what I will say, because I think you will, you know, to avoid you getting attacked on
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   Twitter or wherever you might get attacked.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.260]   I'm going to get attacked anyway.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.520]   If not for this discussion, then another one, but I'm tougher than I am.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.260]   So but it's really species specific, right?
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.780]   So if you think about our species and a lot of primate species, we live in these extended
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.840]   family groups and that's how we evolved.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.080]   And so unlike a goat or a sheep that might live in a herd where there's a lot of non-relatives
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.520]   - we lived in a community of relatives, right?
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.920]   And so we, and we do all kinds of care of extended relatives.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.320]   And so you wouldn't necessarily expect in a primate species where you have this long
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:01.160]   rearing history where help from the family and bi-parental care where, where sort of
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.700]   everybody's sort of like, it takes a village to raise the baby.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.600]   We readily adopt in our, in primate societies, right?
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.800]   And so, you know, like I had a C- I mean, I'll tell you something personal.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   I had a C-section and had, I had a lot of postpartum complications.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.280]   And so lactation didn't work out that well for me.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.560]   One of my friends would say I had massive DVTs and pulmonary emboli.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.040]   And so I almost died after my son was born the first time.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.440]   And so I didn't have a vaginal delivery.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   I couldn't...
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.000]   DVTs, deep vein thrombosis.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.200]   I was sort of like welcome to motherhood and I was in the ICU and had to get a filter put
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.740]   in, an inferior vena cava filter to stop me from dying because I had scattershot clots
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.440]   all over my lungs.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.760]   And so I didn't really, you know, I didn't, I didn't do a vaginal delivery.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.960]   I had a C-section and I wasn't really able to lactate and man, I love that baby, right?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.000]   So, you know, I can give, you know, what I will say is it's really different in primates
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.880]   and we don't really understand how bonding occurs.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:10.400]   But what I will say is that bonding between a mother, you really need to think about the
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.100]   evolutionary selective pressure.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:16.280]   So I was an evolutionary biologist before I found neuroscience, right?
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.400]   And so I really, everything I do, I think about from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:28.860]   So but it is, many people go into the oxytocin, vasopressin field because they have a lot
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.260]   of questions about social interactions, right?
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.340]   Like I think if you think about us as being social is actually one of the, one of the
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.380]   core characteristics of our species, right?
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.540]   So social interactions are rewarding from infancy.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.020]   They keep us alive as you mentioned, right?
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:52.140]   And so I think it's not an accident that the way we think about disorder in our species
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.240]   is many disorders are disorders because of lack of social connectedness, right?
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.540]   So it could be something like autism where, you know, there's these pervasive social interaction
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.860]   impairments.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:10.360]   It could be something like drug abuse where, you know, you, a risk factor for drug abuse
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.740]   is feeling, you know, socially disconnected and alone, right?
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:21.340]   Social isolation or loss of a loved one is a very strong predictor of the onset of a
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.360]   stress-related depressive anxiety disorder.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:31.980]   In terms of when and how oxytocin is released, you mentioned mother-infant bonding.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:38.740]   I think you said yes, that the infant is also releasing oxytocin, we think.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.860]   So it's, it's bi-directional.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   We think.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.920]   I think most of the work has been done in mom would be, and again, this has not been
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.140]   really done well in primates, right?
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:54.680]   So we're extrapolating this information from species that have different evolutionary histories
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   than us, right?
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.160]   So it's goats, sheeps, prairie voles, mice, rats.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.960]   So what do we know about the role of oxytocin in humans?
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.600]   Do we, I mean, we know it's there.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.160]   We presume based on the animal models that it's involved in mother-infant bonding and
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.360]   presumably romantic partner bonding, at least you hear that a lot.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.100]   It was unfortunately nicknamed the love hormone.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:26.000]   And the reason it's unfortunate it was is that while that might cue attention to oxytocin
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.280]   and I'm a big fan of people paying attention to biological phenomenon, it discards the
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.000]   other and many roles of oxytocin.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.360]   But what can we say about oxytocin in humans if anything?
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.920]   Do we know that it does, I mean, we're just, so we're assuming based on the animal models
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   that it does something.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.320]   I mean, this is very different than like dopamine where there's tons of animal model data,
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:52.240]   but we know, but there are brain imaging where we know where dopamine is expressed and do
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.760]   we even know where oxytocin receptors are expressed in the human brain?
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   Presumably that information is out there.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.760]   Recently, but again, there's a lot of specificity and I think if you're thinking about disorders,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.780]   you would then have to study those specific subpopulations, right?
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.640]   And you need, you know, a lot of this work has been done, so you have to think about
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.960]   how do we study it, right?
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.800]   So the best way to study it would be to have radio tracers where you could then, which
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.520]   we do have for dopamine and other compounds, where you would then go and see where after
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:26.320]   somebody's performed a task, do we see, you know, activation, right, or uptake.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.820]   There are some imaging studies that are usually done giving intranasal oxytocin and then you
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:36.140]   basically ask questions about, okay, we give you oxytocin intranasally, which presumably
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:41.280]   enters the brain, we could talk about reasons why we think that, and then we have you perform
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.700]   on some task, right?
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:47.360]   And so, you know, there's evidence if you give oxytocin, it diminishes the amygdala's
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.380]   response to fearful stimuli, right?
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:55.280]   So that it might have this sort of pro-social effect and it was actually data like that
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.660]   that caused people to start thinking initially about oxytocin.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.800]   And those are data in humans.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   That's right.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.520]   It reminds me that there was this brief moment where oxytocin wasn't just being discussed
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:11.300]   as the love hormone, it was being discussed as the trust hormone, right?
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:17.840]   Also, far too simple a heuristic, but again, I think it's cool that the, you know, that
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.280]   the press picks up on these things and at least tells people about what's being discovered.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.840]   And we just always have to be careful to not have it lead to the assumption that that's
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.560]   the only role of a given hormone.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:36.040]   So it can reduce, apparently it can reduce the output of the amygdala in some way, this
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.420]   brain area associated with threat detection.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:46.760]   And so you could imagine how that would bias the person toward being more pro-social.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.120]   Have there been studies exploring the role of oxytocin in making autistic children more
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.480]   pro-social?
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:00.160]   And behind that question, I suppose, is the assumption you can verify or not that autistic
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   children are less pro-social than other children.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.600]   Is that true?
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.920]   Or is it that, you know, autistic kids are just maybe more pro-social with the one friend
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.920]   they really, really like?
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:16.680]   I happen to know some kids with autism or however you want to phrase it, and they have
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.880]   close friends and they seem to really like those specific friends a lot.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.640]   They seem very happy when they show up at the door and like all the hallmarks of a healthy
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.660]   social mind, but it is true that they are uncomfortable in groups and where there's
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.660]   a lot of noise.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.020]   A busy birthday party is overwhelming for them, but you see them playing with one or
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:42.160]   two friends and like you could see all that and assume, okay, it's just kind of an introverted
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   kid.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   Actually, it kind of reminds me of me.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   You know?
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.760]   I mean, I don't have a problem with crowds, but I much prefer to be with a small group
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   of friends or one close friend.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   I hear you.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   I'm that way too.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   Right.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.120]   So, you know, how do we think about this?
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   Okay.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.360]   Well, I would say the social features of autism are interesting, right?
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.960]   And so you might have, there were, there was an attempt a long time ago, like 1979, there's
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:11.940]   a woman named Lorna Wing who tried to subtype the social features of autism, right?
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:17.500]   And so there could be people that are socially avoidant and really just don't want to have
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.100]   social interactions.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:24.100]   There could be kids that are active, but odd, which means that they have an interest in
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:29.000]   being social, but maybe they don't read social cues, right?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.940]   And they interact in ways that other kids don't understand or make could cause bullying,
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.940]   right?
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   Like in junior high school.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.940]   And that's often why, you know, some autistic kids do better with adults, right?
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:48.260]   Because adults know how to sort of channel discussions with somebody who might be a little
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.900]   socially awkward, right?
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   But there's different phenotypes.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:56.200]   I mean, people having a disinterest in social interactions could be that they're highly
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.460]   socially anxious, right?
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.940]   That making eye contact makes them anxious.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:20.180]  � Again, that's another caveat.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.740]   There have been some studies administering oxytocin to individuals with autism.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.020]   And again, these are these single dose studies.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:34.900]   So the first studies that were done were looking at single dose oxytocin in males because some
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.900]   of the, and we can talk a little bit about why oxytocin versus vasopressin, which vasopressin
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.180]   actually would have been my choice based on the animal literature, and we can talk about
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   that.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.660]   But vaso oxytocin was given to males partly because it wouldn't, the idea would be that
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:55.740]   the off target effects in the peripheral nervous system, i.e. milk let down uterine contractions
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.380]   are not going to happen in males, right?
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.760]   And so it was deemed that they might be safer subjects.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.820]   Males are often also the go-to for research studies, as you may have talked about on your
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.980]   podcast before too.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.540]   Yeah, something that fortunately is changing, thanks to a mandate by the NIH.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.540]   Correct.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:19.580]   I had to just kind of smile/raise my eyebrows a little bit at the idea that the assumption
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:23.940]   that oxytocin administered to males, yes, one can see why it wouldn't cause milk let
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:29.420]   down or uterine contractions, but of course there could be other peripheral effects of
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.520]   oxytocin in males.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.020]   But they had to pick one, so they went with males.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.420]   Okay, so, and there is this higher incidence of autism in males, so it's not a terrible
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.420]   place to start.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.180]   You just would hope that they would also do the experiment on females.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.740]   So they're doing this by nasal spray?
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.900]   So intranasal.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.980]   One dose.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.980]   Correct.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.100]   And for reasons that I don't understand, it's 24 international units, and I think maybe
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.820]   somebody did the first study using it, and this is how science happens, right?
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.540]   And it worked, and so then everyone uses that protocol.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:02.340]   And so then there's been a lot of studies looking at, you know, there's one reading
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.660]   the mind and the eyes, so can you look at pictures of somebody's eyes and then ask what
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.940]   is the emotion that they're feeling, right?
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.620]   After receiving this intranasal.
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:13.260]   Oxytocin or placebo.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.740]   Where is your eye gaze going in a picture, right?
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.980]   So one of the theories is that people with autism may, at least a subset of them, lack
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.100]   social motivation.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.940]   So maybe they're not looking in the places like eyes where you receive a lot of social
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.540]   cues that are relevant to social communication.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:36.380]   And so some of these early studies showed that a single dose of oxytocin in people that
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.580]   had high-functioning autism, so they were verbal, like you said, they could come in
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.420]   for studies, and that it looked like it had some potential effectiveness.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:49.460]   And so there became a really strong interest in the field to think about oxytocin potentially
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.260]   as a therapy for autism.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.540]   And is oxytocin available over the counter?
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.940]   Does it require a prescription?
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.540]   I mean, you see sites that are selling it, but that doesn't mean anything these days.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.540]   Right, yeah.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.460]   There's gray market, there's all sorts of stuff going on.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:09.380]   But I know people that have used oxytocin, there's actually a market for, and by the
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.740]   way, folks, I'm not suggesting this, but someone the other day told me that they've been regularly
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:22.100]   taking oxytocin ketamine nasal inhalations as part of their work with their licensed
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:29.900]   therapist on PTSD-type stuff relating to, let's just call it relational trauma.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.460]   So that's happening.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.500]   But let's just think about oxytocin alone for the moment.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.220]   Are parents of autistic kids able to buy oxytocin nasal spray?
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.220]   No.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:50.340]   So it would need to be written, the prescription would need to be written by a physician.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.820]   And it's not on the market.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:56.300]   So there's one thing we should say is there's only two drugs that are approved by the FDA
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:02.340]   to treat autism, and they're both antipsychotics, which they treat associated features like
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:08.540]   irritability, and they have off-target effects like weight gain, and so we don't have any
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.980]   medications that are currently approved in the U.S., or anywhere else for that matter,
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.060]   to treat the core features of autism.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:23.640]   Interesting and unfortunate, and hopefully that will change in the not-too-distant future.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:27.860]   Do we know that children with autism, people with autism, because I'm going to just sort
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:34.660]   of assume that autism is stable over the lifespan, like if a child is diagnosed with autism,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.880]   are they going to be an adolescent and adult with autism?
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:42.640]   So I would say that in a lot of cases autism has lifelong impact, but there are people
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.760]   who outgrow their diagnosis.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:49.300]   There are people who respond well to behavioral therapy.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.340]   I mean obviously it's not the cure-all for everybody, there's lots of people who go through
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.900]   intensive behavioral therapy and probably see minimal benefit, but I mean it's certainly
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:06.180]   something that occurs in childhood, the diagnosis occurs in childhood, and for most people will
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.140]   then be present across the lifespan.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:12.520]   So we could say people with autism, because each study sometimes will have adults, sometimes
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.580]   you'll have teenagers, sometimes you'll have kids.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.360]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.060]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:27.560]   and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.220]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:35.580]   many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.220]   from a quality blood test.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.320]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.380]   back about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth, but you don't know what to do
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.780]   with that information.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.900]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:55.420]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones,
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:59.940]   et cetera, but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition,
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.900]   behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers into
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.060]   the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.660]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20%
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.340]   off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:17.480]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:22.360]   Is it known whether or not people with autism, assuming they meet the criteria for being
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:30.380]   autistic at that moment, have lower natural circulating or active levels of oxytocin?
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:36.440]   Because, you know, it's one thing for a nasal spray of oxytocin to improve social functioning.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:44.100]   It's another to know that the effect is addressing an underlying biological deficit.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.980]   - Yeah, it's such a great question.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.420]   Okay, so we should unpack that 'cause there's been a lot of work in this area.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.800]   So the first question is where are we measuring the oxytocin, right?
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.100]   So we mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of effects in the body as well as the brain,
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:01.160]   and it's released into the blood, but it's also released directly into the brain.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.340]   And there's variable evidence about if you measure it in blood, is it a readout of the
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   brain or not, right?
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:11.120]   Or should you be looking at something like spinal fluid that's maybe a better biochemical
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.620]   proxy of the brain?
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:20.660]   Most studies, so what I will say is there's been a handful of small studies where there
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:27.040]   has been some, you know, there's been some benefit, maybe no benefit, small effects.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:33.220]   We did a study that was a small study at Stanford, and it was based on mouse genetic data.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.500]   And I'll sort of walk you through what we did.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:43.540]   So there's multiple mouse models of these neurogenetic syndromes where people have social
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.540]   impairment, right?
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.560]   We can quibble about whether that's autism or not, but that they have social impairment.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:53.640]   And so that there are this fragile X mouse, there's a Prader-Willi syndrome mouse, which
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.980]   is the Magyl 2 gene that gets manipulated, and then there's a Catnap 2 mouse.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:05.660]   And in all of those instances, when you genetically modify those mice, you see a reduction of
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.340]   oxytocin in the hypothalamus.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.820]   And what's interesting is that in those instances where you see this genetic modification, you
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:18.620]   do see lower blood levels in these genetically defined models.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:24.100]   What's really cool is you can give oxytocin across development in those models, and at
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:31.480]   least in the Catnap 2 mouse, you can restore oxytocin neuron number to equivalent of control
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:37.000]   animals, suggesting that oxytocin is doing something in these oxytocin deficient animals,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   right?
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.920]   So these are not an oxytocin gene manipulation, but these are these syndromes where you see
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:47.300]   as a consequence of manipulating genes for these syndromes that oxytocin gets knocked
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.420]   down, right?
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:54.220]   And so our thinking when we went into our clinical trial was what if it's blood oxytocin
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:59.340]   levels that there are going to be a subset of individuals that just make less oxytocin
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:06.360]   humans, and that maybe those are the individuals who stand to benefit the most from treatment.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:14.120]   And so we were the first group to ask across this range of individuals who showed up, and
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.000]   we did in all the trials that we'll talk about today, these are done with my colleague, Antonio
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.640]   Hardin at Stanford, who's a child psychiatrist, and we always have double blind, meaning that
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.360]   the investigative team is blind and that they are unaware, I should say, they're unaware
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.880]   of treatment, and then the families and the children are unaware.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.080]   And then the randomized, meaning there was an equal chance you could get either drug
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.720]   or placebo, and they're controlled, right?
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   Okay.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:47.260]   So we asked if we know what your pretreatment blood oxytocin level is, who's going to benefit
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   from treatment?
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.860]   And we thought a couple of really interesting things.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:55.800]   One was that the lower your baseline, so your pretreatment blood oxytocin level, you showed
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   much greater benefit from the oxytocin intervention.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   These are shown-
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.500]   One intervention, one nasal spray?
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.620]   This was four weeks, sorry, I should have clarified.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:09.280]   This is four weeks of treatment being administered to oxytocin twice a day.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.660]   And so we saw effectiveness there.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.360]   Sorry to interrupt so much, but just male and female subjects?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.640]   We did, but again, because autism is male biased and prevalence, even if you make this
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:27.240]   heroic effort to over recruit, try to get more girls in, in the study, we usually try
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.040]   to aim for the prevalence rate because it's difficult to get girls just because there's
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.040]   fewer of them.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   Got it.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   Okay.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.040]   But boys and girls were included.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   Correct.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.040]   They're taking oxytocin over the period of-
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   Four weeks.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   Four weeks.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.240]   And if they started off with lower baseline levels of oxytocin, you observed a benefit
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.280]   of the oxytocin treatment in those individuals.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.360]   What about the individuals who had normal to high levels?
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.180]   You didn't see much benefit, right?
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:57.600]   And so that was a cue to me to think that there may be a subset of individuals that
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.160]   for whatever reason, they have lower oxytocin and they may stand to benefit more from treatment.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.880]   And none of the prior studies had looked at blood oxytocin levels.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.800]   And so what we had thought was that, well, maybe if everybody had measured baseline blood
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.960]   oxytocin levels, maybe some of these, maybe there would have been more positive outcomes.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:23.440]   So but there's a lot of controversy in this field about whether oxytocin is a treatment
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.480]   for autism, right?
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:31.240]   So after we completed that trial, there was a large multi-site what's called a phase three
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.320]   oxytocin treatment trial that was done at, I think, five sites and they gave oxytocin
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:44.120]   for an extended period of time and they showed no benefit.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.800]   Were they looking to see who started off with low levels of oxytocin at pretreatment?
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.240]   So what was interesting about that study, and there were a lot of issues with it, was
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:02.520]   that oxytocin is something where you have to, if you look at it, it degrades.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.960]   That's kind of what I joke about, right?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.400]   So you need to take it.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.640]   When we go in, we have these really intense protocols, right?
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.240]   So you go in and we have vacutainer tubes that are cold and we put them on ice and then
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.600]   the phlebotomist takes the blood from the child.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.360]   So a lot of technical gymnastics.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.760]   And then we make sure we spin it in a centrifuge cold and then we pipet it onto dry ice.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.360]   So we have very minimal loss of the signal.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.660]   And so if you don't adhere to those rigid protocols, which is very difficult to do across
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.840]   multiple sites, it can be very difficult to get an accurate read of oxytocin.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.000]   And so I think for me, it's still an open question.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.480]   They didn't see the blood oxytocin predicted response in that study.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.200]   The data weren't provided in the paper.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.340]   It was just said that they didn't.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.220]   But it's still an open question.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:17.760]   And so that, you know, maybe that is the way, so if you give it acutely, like in those early
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.160]   studies we talked about, that maybe oxytocin, you know, diminishes fear.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.720]   We know that oxytocin decreases the stress axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.220]   and then it can diminish anxiety in animal models.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.220]   So that's well-established.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:37.100]   And in a former life, I was a stress researcher, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.100]   this.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:43.420]   But it's sort of, the sad thing is, is that once you have a negative trial, there isn't
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.460]   a lot of interest in funding the work going forward, right?
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:53.100]   And so I think it's still really an open question about if there is a subset of individuals
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.980]   that could benefit from oxytocin replacement therapy, right?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:03.100]   And it's, and until there's money to do that work, we may not ever know the answer.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.660]   Well, it will be important for that work to be done eventually.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:11.500]   Hopefully the field will return to it despite whatever trends might be happening now.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:17.440]   I think it's important to know for the parents of autistic children, whether or not there
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:24.820]   were any negative effects of oxytocin administration, in particular in the children that did not
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.860]   benefit from oxytocin treatment.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.440]   The rationale is the following, well, of course, these things require a prescription.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.940]   If a parent has a child with autism, especially if they're young enough that the behavioral
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:40.140]   interventions could possibly stand a good chance of inducing neuroplasticity, rewiring
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.780]   of the neural circuits that underlie social connection, well, then there's this time-limited
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:52.740]   window in which, you know, those parents presumably are willing to try most anything provided
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.120]   it's safe.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.040]   So let's assume, and I'm making up these numbers now because I haven't seen this study, but
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.900]   according to what you told me, that let's say a third of the autistic boys and girls
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.460]   that come in have low baseline levels of oxytocin.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.880]   They're the ones that are going to benefit from this oxytocin intervention.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.480]   The other two thirds don't.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.340]   Well, given the difficulties of measuring baseline levels of oxytocin, most people don't
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.260]   have access to those kinds of resources.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:23.940]   If it's safe to give oxytocin no matter what, well, then if I were that parent, I'd be knocking
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.420]   on my physician's door saying, "Hey, give me an oxytocin spray because my kid might
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.460]   fall into that one third category."
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:34.540]   If and only if it turns out that oxytocin is safe to give, but if there's a risk profile
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.680]   that doesn't justify that kind of shotgun approach, well, then I wouldn't do that.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.140]   So is oxytocin spray safe?
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:48.260]   And if so, why doesn't every physician who has a patient with autism give them oxytocin
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.260]   nasal spray?
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.260]   Right.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.260]   It's a great question.
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.920]   And I know that, you know, I'm a parent of three children and I know this sense of like
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.000]   you would do anything to help your child, right?
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.700]   And so I think the tricky part is that it was the one thing I will say is that all of
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   the studies and there's been many of them have shown that oxytocin is relatively safe
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.420]   in a pediatric population, right?
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.780]   The tricky part is I don't know, there's physicians that, you know, really pay attention to clinical
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.340]   trials and if they don't see a benefit, they may not be willing to write the prescription,
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.340]   right?
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:27.500]   So until we could identify a group of children that could benefit, you know, we need to create
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:32.940]   the opportunity for physicians to recognize that this could potentially still be a treatment,
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   right?
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.300]   But that work, you know, but I think the tricky part and what I will say is, and we can maybe
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:42.540]   talk a bit about vasopressin, which, you know, my feeling is that if I was placing bets and
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.620]   having to choose between these two, my money would be on vasopressin.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.180]   Well, we are definitely going to talk about vasopressin in detail.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:55.220]   I mean, the reason I mentioned that hypothetical scenario is just the sense of urgency and
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:00.620]   in some cases desperation that parents feel and, you know, time's ticking and if oxytocin
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.300]   is safe, then, you know, I guess I'll put in my vote that, you know, parents should
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:09.040]   at least talk to their physician, maybe even hand them the study to consider.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.860]   But I can also understand the perspective of a pediatrician who says, "Well, listen,
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.700]   it was a small number of kids that benefited.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.440]   You're welcome to try it, but I don't, you know, it doesn't seem like the results are
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   that impressive."
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.100]   But, you know, this gets to a bunch of larger issues about, you know, medical care and randomized
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:30.780]   controlled trials and the desperation of parents and kids to treat neurodevelopmental challenges.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:38.940]   I just want to ask because it feels relevant in a real way, you know, if ultimately the
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:46.460]   goal of improving symptom profiles in autistic kids is about improving social cognition and
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:53.520]   social behavior and that process involves rewiring of brain circuits, neuroplasticity,
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.660]   is there any reason to think that other approaches to inducing neuroplasticity would be beneficial
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.620]   even if they're not in the biological pathways that are disrupted in autism?
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:11.680]   I think, for instance, about the now extensive use of SSRIs for the treatment of depression,
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.020]   some cases it works, in some cases it doesn't.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:19.900]   Side effect profiles are a serious concern as discussed on this podcast before, but ultimately
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.000]   we know that depression is not a serotonin deficiency.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.620]   In most cases, SSRIs are atypical antidepressants like buprenorphine, wellbutrin and things
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.620]   of that sort.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:36.060]   When they work, they probably work because of their ability to induce or assist neuroplasticity,
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   right?
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:43.940]   Also, the trials on psilocybin are not really about psilocybin, they're about neuroplasticity.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.020]   At least the trials for depression, right?
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.520]   There may be other uses of psilocybin that relate more directly to the effects of psilocybin.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.600]   But ultimately, you know, what we're talking about here is the attempt to rewire the brain
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.840]   in a specific way, whether or not it's assisted by oxytocin or some other mechanism.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:07.520]   So the question is, are there trials happening where people are exploring, say, psilocybin,
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:13.460]   MDMA, which by the way, we know increases oxytocin and serotonin dramatically, as well
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:20.040]   as things like atypical antidepressants in kids that have autism, not because we think
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.580]   that those autistic kids are deficient in any of the neurochemicals that these drugs
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:28.700]   would target, but that these drugs can help rewire the brain, and ultimately that's what
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.700]   these kids need.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.700]   Right.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.700]   It's a really great point.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.020]   And there might be subsets of kids, right?
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:38.940]   There might be kids where there would be a medication that would target other pathways,
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.220]   but that potently releases oxytocin, right?
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.260]   But there might be kids that have an oxytocin deficiency, right?
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.980]   But I think that that circles back to your point at the beginning, where our point is
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:56.860]   that autism is a very heterogeneous condition and being able to know before you begin a
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:02.080]   trial, right, like who am I going to put into it and what is my primary outcome, like one
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.420]   measure that I think is going to move the needle, right?
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.560]   Like it kind of requires a crystal ball.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.600]   So there's a lot of guesswork that goes into this.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.860]   But I would very much like to see, I will say one other thing that, I have a colleague
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.160]   named Adam Guistela, who's at the University of Sydney, and he published a paper a year
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:26.620]   or two ago now, suggesting that oxytocin may be most effective in kids at younger ages.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.900]   And don't quote me, somewhere between two and five or three and six or something like
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   that.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   We'll find the paper and put it in the show notes.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:42.100]   So it could be, to your point about neuroplasticity, that oxytocin may be maximally beneficial
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.720]   in younger ages, right?
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:50.340]   And if these studies or these hodgepodge is across ages and across sort of different social
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:55.220]   phenotypes, finding that signal is really important, right?
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:03.660]   And maybe age is a driver or maybe low blood oxytocin regardless of what age you are, or
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:08.880]   maybe in Adam's case, if you recruit really young children, you're likely to see a benefit
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.980]   just because the brain is wiring up and it's more plastic at younger ages.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:21.880]   That's also a vote, in my opinion, for early examination of kids, right?
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.460]   Like parents really need to get autism screening and perhaps maybe the most important thing
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:32.260]   is to make autism screening as available and as inexpensive as possible for everyone because
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.020]   of the importance of early intervention, even if it's purely behavioral intervention, but
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.300]   certainly if it's behavioral and drug interventions.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.780]   The clinic wait times are really long, right?
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.140]   So you have to have a specialist who's capable to diagnose autism.
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:50.360]   And so you could have a clinic where you're showing troublesome features and a parent
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.000]   wants to get their kid into a clinic and you could have a 12-month or 18-month wait time,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   right?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.260]   And so there are a lot of people that are thinking about, are there laboratory-based
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:06.220]   tests that we can develop maybe either for detection or clinical referral, right?
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:12.540]   So could we come up with a biomarker panel, for instance, where we might be able to say,
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:20.180]   wow, here's a panel where we think this child is at reasonable risk for developing autism.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.900]   Can we make sure they're prioritized for getting a diagnosis, right?
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:29.160]   So we can get them an early intervention, but right now we don't have that, right?
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:35.240]   So having some sort of laboratory-based test, whether it could be biological or if we could
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.600]   do something with eye gaze, and there's a lot of companies working on these things now
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   to say this may not, and also obviously again, autism is always controversial in this field,
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600]   right?
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.600]   There's so many different stakeholders.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.100]   A lot of clinicians will say, well, I don't want a 30-second video clip replacing expert
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.100]   clinical opinion.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.560]   There's good reasons for them to feel that way, but I think if there was a way to prioritize
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.900]   people that are in this line, we could get diagnoses faster.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:08.260]   Well, you wouldn't want false positives, but I would think that a 30-second video clip,
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.320]   provided it's of something useful, it's going to be more valuable than nothing given the
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.340]   time sensitivity.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:19.820]   What are some of the barriers to getting this behavioral testing to be not just more prominent
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.460]   but pervasive?
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:26.300]   Like it seems to me that, well, I recall in school they gave us the hearing test.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.460]   We all marched onto the bus.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:33.540]   We get the beep test and for hearing challenges.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.540]   You get vision tests.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:39.060]   You get the Babinski reflex test, not the moment you come out of the womb, but pretty
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   soon after.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:47.680]   I mean, why isn't this stuff happening for autism for every kid?
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.240]   It's not scalable, right?
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.360]   So these interviews with parents and the tests that you do can take hours, right?
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.180]   And any given clinician, even if they're working really long hours, there just aren't that
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:04.360]   many people that have the extensive training needed to make these expert diagnoses, right?
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.820]   And so I think that there's clinicians that are doing the absolute best they can, but
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.380]   they can only see a certain number of people a week, right?
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.740]   Does it have to be a physician?
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.140]   Sorry to interrupt.
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:19.460]   Or could a well-trained technician do this?
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:24.100]   Well, I mean, I think technically it's a DSM diagnosis, right?
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.140]   So it's usually somebody who has a clinical degree.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.860]   So it would be a clinical psychologist.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.180]   It could be a behavioral pediatrician.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.900]   It could be a child psychiatrist or a child neurologist, but I mean, again, that requires
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.260]   years and years of training.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:44.220]   And if we look in areas where people have fewer access to resource, I mean, particularly
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:50.560]   in impoverished areas, the mean age of an autism diagnosis is years later than in wealthy
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.660]   areas where there's many different medical specialists with parents that aren't working
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:14:02.440]   three jobs and can sit waiting around and really lobby and really advocate for their
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.780]   kids because if they don't show up for work that day, they're not going to get fired from
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   their job, right?
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:15.140]   And so I think that if there's some sort of solution that allows there to be a more democratic
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:21.460]   approach to saying we need a really quick way, like you said, to be able to identify
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:26.820]   at-risk children, especially if it's a blood test or something like that, you know, it
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.980]   could be incredibly impactful.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:39.700]   Are there human trials exploring MDMA, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also referred to as ecstasy, and/or psilocybin
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.340]   for treatment of autism?
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:47.500]   So I was aware that MAPS had an MDMA trial in autism.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.420]   I don't know what's happened with that.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   Perhaps it's still ongoing.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.420]   I'll check the MAPS site.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.060]   I'm in communication with them from time to time.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:00.560]   I mean, the reason for asking, and of course, you know, but maybe in case some of the listeners
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.300]   don't, is that MDMA causes these massive increases in serotonin.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:12.400]   That seems to be the major source of the MDMA effect, so to speak, based on the work of
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:19.160]   our colleague, Rob Malanka, and at least one human study comparing MDMA to very high dose
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:25.100]   oxytocin treatment, kind of ruled out the oxytocin spike that's induced by MDMA as
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:29.280]   the source or the only source, but of course, these chemicals can synergize.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.260]   But based on its chemical profile, oxytocin release, massive serotonin release, dopamine
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:40.540]   release, and a propensity to enhance neuroplasticity, I mean, assuming all the safety protocols
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:48.780]   were there, seems like not the perfect drug, but not a bad choice if, of course, it's inducing
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.220]   the kind of plasticity that someone with autism would be seeking.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   Right.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.100]   I mean, I think the tricky part, especially in children, right, is there's going to be
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.560]   a reluctance to potentially give them psychedelics, right?
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:06.860]   And so, you know, is there a way to modify, you know, the chemical compound to, you know,
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.900]   be something that parents might be more willing to give to their children, right?
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.900]   Right.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.440]   And I totally agree with that, I guess, to play devil's advocate, not against you, but
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:21.860]   well, I'll just state it very directly, and then I'll take the heat as necessary.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:29.620]   I mean, I've done two episodes about the drugs that, you know, millions, tens of millions,
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.260]   if not hundreds of millions of parents are already giving their kids for ADHD, which
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:38.260]   are include amphetamines, including dioxin, methamphetamine is actually a prescription
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:43.260]   drug for a very small subset of kids with ADHD, but things like Adderall, Vyvanse, even
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:47.040]   methylphenidate Ritalin, I mean, these are amphetamines, they induce dopamine release
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.540]   and norepinephrine release.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:54.140]   And again, I'm not suggesting people give their kids MDMA to try and ameliorate symptoms
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:59.260]   of autism, but something chemically similar to it ought to be developed, or at least explored
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.380]   in a human trial, in my opinion.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.800]   Well, time will tell, I'll reach out to the MAPS group and see what's happening.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.340]   Let's talk about vasopressin, because there's a lot to discuss there.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:14.540]   So you told us this is a molecule that chemically is very similar to oxytocin.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.740]   Is it manufactured in the human brain and body?
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740]   Yes.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:18.740]   Okay.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.300]   Do we know a subset of the sites that it's known to be produced and where some of its
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.300]   actions are?
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:29.980]   And you mentioned the kidney and the antiderioratic hormone roles, but within the brain, like
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:34.540]   what brain areas have neurons that make vasopressin or have the receptors for vasopressin?
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.860]   I mean, the receptors are all over the brain.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.620]   And again, it varies depending on the species.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:46.480]   And the way the receptors are measured are in post-mortem tissue, which can be very difficult
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.800]   to get good samples.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.380]   And so we need to have that caveat going in.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:59.240]   But yeah, I mean, it's made in the hypothalamus, and it's released all over the brain.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.460]   And there is vasopressin receptors all over the brain.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:09.020]   And what's really interesting about vasopressin, I always sort of joke that oxytocin always
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.180]   saw its day in the sun, if you will.
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.820]   And the vasopressin was sort of the stepchild that was left sort of behind.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:24.660]   And the reason why I find this fascinating is, again, I think back to my roots as an
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:27.140]   evolutionary biologist, behavioral neuroscientist.
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:32.100]   And what was interesting is that there were studies in the early to mid 1990s showing
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:36.220]   that vasopressin was critical for male social behavior.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.520]   And so there was work, there was a variety of people, and I think Rob Malenka mentioned
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:48.100]   this on the podcast he did, about there was a group of people like Sue Carter, Larry Young,
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.540]   Tom Insull, some of these early people.
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:54.260]   And they gave vasopressin to male prairie voles.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:19:03.460]   And vasopressin was what induced pair bonding with a female mate and also paternal care.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:09.120]   And as I recall, those experiments were done in the context of looking at polygamy versus
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.900]   monogamy of these prairie voles.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:18.640]   Prairie voles versus like a different species, so same genus, but a different species.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.800]   So it might be a montane vole or, you know, highly related, but these other species.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.500]   So prairie voles are monogamous.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.500]   The males-
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:28.500]   For life?
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.500]   Well, I mean, that was the mark.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   50% divorce, right?
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   That was, I don't think it's that bad, but I think marketing-
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.960]   They're doing better than we are as a species.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   That's true.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   We should look to them for pointers.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.340]   And all the divorce folks are saying, "Wait, why'd you say better?"
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.980]   I have some divorce friends that have said, "Divorce is like the greatest thing."
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.700]   So we always say like doing better, doing worse, right?
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:50.960]   Anyway, that's a whole other podcast and certainly not the Huberman Lab podcast, or maybe it is,
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   or will be.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:59.700]   Yeah, my understanding is that you have certain voles that mate with almost exclusively with
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.400]   one other vole for their entire lifespan.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.860]   And then you have other voles located elsewhere that in those colonies, they mate with lots
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   of different voles.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.780]   So the males and females have lots of different partners, raise young with lots of different
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.180]   partners, mating with lots of different partners.
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:21.660]   And that if you give vasopressin, then you can make the, I always want to call them polyamorous,
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.100]   but I don't know if they love each other.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.380]   I'm going to anthropomorphize and assume they love each other.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:31.820]   The polygamous moles, not polyamorous, but polygamous moles then become monogamous.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.660]   Well, yeah, I would say that is probably not the take-home message.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:38.980]   So the take-home message would be they had, let's say that there was like the good voles,
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   right?
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   Which are the prairie voles.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.540]   And they were the ones that formed these monogamous pair bonds.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.520]   Dad participates in paternal care with mom.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.000]   They co-raise babies together and then dad chases off intruders, right?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.280]   And then there's the more asocial voles.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.860]   And so these are like the montane voles.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:04.200]   And we'll see, it's a complicated story, but there's these montane voles where males and
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.060]   females live separately.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.360]   Females like maybe live on the male's territory.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:12.020]   The male mates with a few different females absolutely doesn't provide any paternal care
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.020]   at all.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.360]   Mom raises babies by herself, right?
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.840]   So these are really the two models.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.160]   This is like 1950s versus 2020s.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   Yes.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.380]   To be, just to broadly stereotype.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.100]   To broadly stereotype.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:29.500]   And if you give, okay, so for prairie voles, they're sort of primed to form bonds and to
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.180]   be the males to be good daddies, if you will.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:37.540]   And all you have to do is give them a single injection of vasopressin and you know, or
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.540]   you can give an antagonist and usually the way they form the bond is through mating,
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.540]   right?
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:46.840]   So they, you put them with a female, they mate, they cohabit for a bit.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.620]   There's been all kinds of parametric studies.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:52.960]   I can't remember how many hours it takes to form a parabond, but then you can do these
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.920]   things called partner preference tests and then you can say, here's the guy that you
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:57.920]   mated with.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.720]   Here's this guy you don't know and you can do it for males and you can do it for females
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.760]   and they pick their partner.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.500]   They choose to go hang out with their partner.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:09.120]   The montane voles, you know, either after mating with somebody may either be equal or
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.440]   maybe they'll even go spend time with a new individual.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:16.420]   So the cleanest story was that prairie voles are monogamous, montane voles are not monogamous,
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:23.140]   but in the prairie voles, you could give vasopressin instead of mated cohabitation and you could
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:28.500]   turn on like, you know, a bond with somebody after only living with them for a very short
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.440]   period of time, right?
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.180]   Or you could induce paternal behavior.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.460]   And I was working with the voles species in grad school.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:39.960]   I think the most interesting scientific experience that I've ever had, right?
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.520]   And you and I both know this, right?
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.420]   When you're young, you're actually the person doing the work, right?
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.460]   As you become, you know, the head of your lab, you're mostly writing grants and giving
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.460]   talks, right?
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.980]   And then you get to hear about the super cool things that everybody in your lab is doing,
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   right?
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.400]   Eventually the members of your laboratory kick you out of the lab.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.980]   They literally say like, get out of here.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.140]   You're leaving things in the wrong place.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.420]   Whereas initially you're telling them, Hey, that's in the wrong place within a year or
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:06.420]   two.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:12.780]   For me, I think it took about four or five years, but by about year six, I was demoted
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.820]   to my office to just write grants and write papers.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.200]   I was told that one time I was back there and I tried to wait and I was like, so excited
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.620]   what they were working on.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.020]   And they basically just said, go write grants and bring in more money, right?
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.420]   Like that was kind of their attitude.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.800]   Like we get to be the ones who get to do the cool stuff.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:33.340]   So back when I got to actually do the science, I remember I had this species where, and I,
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:35.740]   and again, I told you, I came at this from an evolutionary perspective.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:39.180]   So these were called meadow voles and I found them very interesting.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:43.620]   So when I showed up in my thesis advisor's lab, she's, I said, I really want to study
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:47.580]   oxytocin and vasopressin and I really want to study voles and I know you have a voles
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   species.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.580]   And she said, well, I don't have prairie voles.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.000]   I have these meadow voles and I'm studying them because they're so sensitive to light
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.100]   and they change their behavior based on light.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.780]   And I, she said, well, you can do what you want, but our grants basically have to have
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.140]   a circadian component.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.340]   And so she said, you got to work that in, but then we kind of struck this deal.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.900]   So I was hanging out in the animal rooms and I thought it was really fascinating.
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:13.220]   So she had animals that were either on short day lengths or long day lengths.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.220]   So the mimicking summer and winter.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.900]   And I was noticing that on winter day lengths, the, the males were hanging out with the females
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.180]   and when the female had a litter, he was like participating and I was like, whoa, these
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.700]   are not supposed to be monogamous animals.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.740]   And so I went into the field research and they were doing all these radio telemetry
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.740]   studies.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.940]   And so like if you should probably explain what those are, putting a little transmitter
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.300]   under the skin, it's painless for the animal, but that allows the researcher to monitor
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:47.580]   the behavior of the animal in the field remotely without having to, you know, put them in cages
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.580]   and stuff.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.740]   And so this is like under field conditions and voles are everybody's favorite snacks.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.100]   So they have like a very limited lifespan in the wild.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:00.620]   I mean like on the order of months and, and so like if you have a short lifespan, like
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.660]   you should just keep reproducing, right?
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:07.100]   And so what was interesting is at the end of the summer days, as you're going into winter,
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:11.460]   territories collapse and males are found with females and they co-raise babies.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.460]   It makes sense.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:16.920]   If it's, you're going to have a litter and mom needs to get up to go eat, you need somebody
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:20.000]   to sit there and warm those babies or they're going to die because they're going to freeze
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   to death.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   Right?
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.940]   So I started saying like, wow, I think these metaphors are good dads.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.240]   Like I'm noticing this.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.160]   And so I told my thesis advisor, I want to study how oxytocin and vasopressin can, maybe
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.540]   this is involved in tracking these evolutionary mating strategies.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.420]   And so again, like the coolest experience I ever had was on these males that were housed
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.700]   under short day length.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.500]   So they were like winter males.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:50.660]   I was able to put vasopressin directly into their brains and, and it was like turning
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:55.100]   on a light switch and they ran around the cage, picked up all these babies, put them
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.540]   in a nest and huddled over them.
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:01.340]   And if you put a placebo into their brain, nothing happened.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:07.100]   And so to me, I always filed that away in, you know, in the back of my mind of like,
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:12.420]   wow, vasopressin is this really interesting hormone.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:17.700]   And maybe someday I will, I did a postdoc on something else, but it was always, you
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:21.580]   know, back in the back of my mind of, I really want to return to this.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:28.820]   It's so incredible that a eight amino acid long peptide could basically turn these relatively
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.780]   negligent fathers into very attentive fathers.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:32.780]   Yes.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:34.780]   It was fascinating.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.000]   I mean, it just speaks to the power of the peptide vasopressin also speaks to the power
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   of brain circuitry.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.880]   It also speaks to the idea that brain circuitry is often sitting latent in the background,
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.440]   you know, ready to be activated, that it's not just about neuroplasticity and building
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:56.300]   up a new circuit, that some forms of neuroplasticity are about unveiling what's, what's already
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   there.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:02.080]   So those peptides can act like switches, which, you know, kind of makes sense on the one hand,
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.300]   but I've never heard of a result as dramatic as that.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:12.800]   So I'm presuming you're going to tell us that that then led you to go back to vasopressin
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.260]   and explore its ability to induce good parenting and negligent fathers.
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.500]   I haven't studied that yet.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.500]   No.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:25.280]   Well, so I think that, you know, my mom always says chance favors the prepared mind.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:31.180]   And so I was doing my postdoc at Stanford and I got recruited to stay on the faculty
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:35.980]   and I, you know, had been doing work in stress vulnerability and stress resilience.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:41.740]   And I really, and I love doing that work, but I still felt this tug of, you know, I
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:46.380]   had spent all this time in a psychiatry department where I was surrounded by clinicians.
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.780]   And I realized that a lot of the stuff that I was doing had clinical relevance, right?
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.140]   And so sometimes you sort of meet the moment, right?
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:28:00.200]   And so right as I was transitioning to have my own lab in my department, there was a bunch
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   of stuff going on.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.800]   So there were a lot of very dedicated parents who were lobbying for funding for autism research
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.840]   because it was horrifically underfunded.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   Really?
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   Horrifically underfunded.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.840]   Wow.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.400]   I mean, at rates of one in 36 kids.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   Well, not at the time, right?
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.920]   So it was, it was one in 150 or whatever it was back then.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.720]   But there were all these parents and I mean, again, they're heroes in my eyes that they
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.440]   advocated so much for their loved ones.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.600]   And so there was, you know, they started forming parent grassroots organizations that have
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   culminated.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.820]   They all started joining together, which is now Autism Speaks.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.780]   And then there was a man named Jim Simons who runs one of the most successful hedge
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.100]   funds in the world.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.900]   And he decided, wow, I'm in a, you know, there's, let's put money into autism, right?
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:43.900]   And so-
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.900]   Does he have a personal link to autism?
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.740]   I, you'd have to ask him.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:53.700]   Because oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes when you hear about wealthy donors devoting
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.780]   a lot of money to one area of science, there's, there's a familial thing there that, you know,
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.180]   a member of their family or a close friend has this challenge and they, they really want
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.180]   to see that challenge.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.180]   Absolutely.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.980]   I mean, a lot of money I've gotten for my lab from philanthropists and what I will say
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.700]   is the most impactful work I've ever done is through philanthropy, right?
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.180]   They're crazy ideas that no funding agency ever touches, right?
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:21.020]   But yeah, so they put, they both put a lot, you know, there was a lot of emphasis and
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:26.180]   so because the Simons Foundation started issuing requests for applications, there was a group
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:31.380]   at Stanford that formed and it was a clinician with a basic scientist.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:36.180]   And my chair at the time said, well, you know, almost nothing is known about the biological
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.180]   basis of autism.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:41.940]   Why don't you go, I'm going to introduce you to the head of child psychiatry.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.420]   You should go talk to this group.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:49.200]   And so as I was preparing my slides and realizing that, you know, social interaction impairments
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.980]   were a core feature of autism, I thought, wow, you know, these neuropeptides may really
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:58.060]   be, you know, a part of this puzzle.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:04.520]   And so that's actually really how I got pulled into autism research was, was through that.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:10.460]   And it was, I was, you know, everybody at the time was very interested in oxytocin and,
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:16.540]   you know, I remember thinking, so we actually did probably the most definitive blood oxytocin
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.860]   study because there was this idea, again, like this marketing campaign of like the oxytocin
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:22.780]   deficit hypothesis of autism.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:27.460]   And, you know, given how clinically heterogeneous autism was, we got money actually from the
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:33.440]   Simons Foundation and we did the first study with maybe 200 kids.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.720]   And what we were able to show was that blood oxytocin was not a marker of autism, right?
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:44.540]   So it wasn't like there was a bimodal distribution, meaning two completely non-overlapping levels
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.100]   of oxytocin in people with autism, people without autism.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:53.580]   So the lower your blood oxytocin levels, actually, regardless of who you were, you could be a
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:59.340]   child with autism, you could be an unaffected sibling with autism, or you could be a unrelated
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:00.500]   control child.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:06.500]   And it was the lower your blood oxytocin levels, the greater your sort of social difficulties.
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.020]   And the slopes, you know, were different.
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:11.360]   They started at different points because the behaviors were obviously different.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.840]   But that's what got us thinking about our clinical trial, which is that blood oxytocin
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.840]   level is not going to be this great differentiator between people with and without autism, right?
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.560]   But we might be able to find a subgroup who could benefit from treatment.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:32.560]   But what I like so much about your approach, the way you described it, is that it sets
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.240]   aside, we don't want to say discards, but it sets aside this thing that we call autism,
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.740]   which is already hard to define and diagnose.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:43.780]   And there's all these different spectrums and you're trying to fit and just says, okay,
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:50.180]   children with autism have challenges in social cognition, social behavior, social bonding.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:52.860]   So do adults with autism, for that matter.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.140]   Let's just focus on that.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:32:00.040]   And not worry so much about whether or not somebody is diagnosed as autistic or not.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.740]   And just focus on what are some of the potential neuropeptide deficits or overexpression of
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:11.160]   neuropeptides that may in some way relate to those social challenges.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:17.040]   And then one can circle back to the question about autism in collecting those data.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.220]   But it also points to this idea that when we go after a disease like Alzheimer's, we
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:28.220]   can often miss the possibility that Alzheimer's, while it has deficits in cognition and memory,
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.600]   could also be a bunch of other things like a metabolic disorder of the body.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:38.200]   And so maybe you go after a particular symptomology and try and attack that, and you might actually
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.200]   potentially treat or cure multiple diseases.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.500]   It's a very different approach.
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:50.340]   And I hope people are catching on to the subtlety, but also the potential impact of that.
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:55.420]   Because if I heard correctly, you said there are people who are not autistic who have social
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.620]   functioning deficits.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:02.420]   And they too have less circulating oxytocin.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.420]   Right.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:07.180]   So I would say we haven't studied people where we brought them in and characterized it, right?
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.520]   So these are typically developing kids.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:16.480]   But what we did is in the abilities that are typical of a controlled child, we still saw
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.260]   that gradient, right?
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:25.240]   And so I think it just sort of begs the question about what is oxytocin's role in human sociality,
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.240]   right?
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:32.820]   I mean, I think there's just so much that we don't understand about both of these molecules
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:39.940]   in terms of their disease liability if they're low or their healing potential if we are able
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:45.260]   to use them as modulators of other therapies.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:50.140]   So how did you move from oxytocin to vasopressin?
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:54.620]   You mentioned that everyone was all excited about oxytocin, still the one that we hear
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:34:00.080]   the most about, although after this podcast episode, and when I start blabbing about vasopressin
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.240]   to everybody, maybe that'll change, but I think it's going to take a lot more than that.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.440]   But maybe it's because the name isn't as, there's something about oxytocin that kind
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.300]   of sounds like the love, it looks like the love hormone, but like vasopressin should
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.300]   be renamed.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   Right.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.860]   It should be called something else, like not antiderioritic hormone, not vasopressin.
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:23.740]   I mean, you're going to tell us how critically important it is, perhaps even more important
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:27.080]   than oxytocin for autism and social functioning.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.760]   So I don't know, by the end of this podcast, we'll come up with a new name.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   It's needed, right?
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.260]   Well, I'll put it out there.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.260]   Okay.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:38.620]   So how did you get to vasopressin?
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.620]   Okay.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:43.420]   So it was interesting with oxytocin because we didn't, and again, I was skeptical that
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:48.860]   we would see these big group differences, but it was a little bit of like, okay, what everyone's
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:53.660]   saying, this is not going to be the big solution, right?
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:58.860]   And so I actually came at it from the work that we did in monkeys.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.220]   And so I think I mentioned previously at the beginning of the podcast that there were a
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.140]   lot of limitations that I saw.
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:09.980]   And then sometimes if you come into a field, you know, when you're, you're a little bit
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:10.980]   of an outsider, right?
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:16.420]   Like I'm not a clinician, I don't see autism patients, but I also, I have this really strong
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.540]   interest in social behavior and the biology of it.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:30.300]   And so I was thinking about what are things that we need to do to better address the challenges
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.300]   in autism?
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.420]   So one of them was why are we looking in blood, right?
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:37.980]   Like if you look at neurological conditions, there has been a lot of progress made by doing
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:40.960]   biomarker discovery in cerebral spinal fluid, right?
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:48.700]   So like the biological substrates or clues of markers of say various forms of dementia
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:54.140]   or MS were first found in spinal fluid, right?
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:57.620]   Because it's the fluid that bathes the brain and the spinal column.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:01.820]   And so if you're looking for the biochemistry of an illness, that's the closest fluid that
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.220]   you can get to the brain, right?
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.660]   Blood draw just won't do it.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:05.660]   Maybe, right?
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   So that was part of my thinking.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.620]   But then there was the issue of the animal models, right?
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:14.420]   So there was drug after drug after drug that was tested in mice and they failed in human
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:15.500]   clinical trials.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:23.560]   And so it made me start thinking, could we develop a primate model of naturally occurring
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.220]   social impairments, right?
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:30.420]   So can we, because in autism, these social impairments are, if you will, naturally occurring,
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:31.420]   right?
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:35.460]   And so these spontaneously occur in children.
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:42.500]   And so it made me wonder, could we identify monkeys in a large colony that have social
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:51.140]   impairments and after talking to clinicians who treat these children, can I spend a lot
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:56.300]   of time validating a monkey model where there will be monkeys that have features that look
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:00.600]   like they have direct relevance to core autism symptoms?
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:06.260]   And so what I did was there's a primate center, the California National Primate Research Center.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:11.140]   And so what we did is, so I think I mentioned earlier that there's these surveys that can
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:15.780]   be used to look at autistic traits in the general human population, right?
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:20.660]   And so we refined one of these and we did what we call back translate.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:26.120]   So basically it's an instrument that's used for humans and then what we did is modified
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:31.620]   it to be able to use this rating scale in rhesus macaques, which are an old world monkey
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:33.700]   and I know you're familiar with them.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:38.240]   And I was interested in looking at old world monkeys because there are some of the closest
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.660]   relatives to human that are used in biomedical research.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:47.940]   And as I mentioned previously, these autistic traits are continuously distributed across
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:55.340]   the general human population and that this genetic, let's call it genetic liability,
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:38:01.960]   which is a fancy way of just saying that we think that there's a genetic risk that underlies
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.440]   this continuum of behavioral traits, right?
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.280]   So if we think that that's true in humans and in one of our closest relatives, and we
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.360]   think that some of these genes create proteins that then are what sets up the developing
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.840]   brain to develop in the way that autistic brains develop.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.020]   So let's just assume that that's the premise, that's what we went in with.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:27.460]   Can we find rhesus macaques that are just living in large outdoor colonies and identify
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:30.740]   animals that might be good models for autism?
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.860]   And the answer is yes, we could do this all kinds of different ways.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:39.860]   One is we could just take people and score monkey behaviors outside their cages while
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:41.980]   they're interacting with their peers.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:47.120]   We can use rating scales, and again, the rating scale we use, it's called the social responsiveness
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   scale.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:52.260]   So this is called the macaque social responsiveness scale, revised, it's a mouthful.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:56.220]   But what it allows us to do is measure autistic-like traits in monkeys.
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:39:01.900]   And we can also bring monkeys in for experimental tests to see where their eyes look or how
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:07.340]   do they perform, how do they respond to videos of other monkeys, you know, if they're making
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:13.220]   affiliative overtures, do they do like, you know, macaques global, which is a positive
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.220]   response.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.820]   Well, they do that, right?
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.460]   I'm going to apologize for interrupting again, but I just had to tell people this because
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:24.020]   I spent time up at the UC Davis primate center as a graduate student.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:27.540]   And by the way, what we're referring to here are non-invasive observational studies, at
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.540]   least thus far.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:35.900]   So these are monkeys living in large exclosures, not enclosures, large exclosures forming colonies
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.240]   and social relationships.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.140]   And you know, I think anyone that sees monkeys at the zoo, and we all learned that monkeys
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.140]   go ee, ee, ee, and they don't ee, ee, ee.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:51.260]   If you want a monkey to like you, you learn this working with macaques.
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:57.040]   First of all, they don't ee, ee, ee, the affiliative call is a hoo, hoo, they do this really nice.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.660]   And the little ones, I spent a lot of time with these monkeys and the little ones, they
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.960]   do this thing where they go, I used to nurse the little ones every once in a while, they
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.280]   hoo, hoo, and they're just, you know, it just like makes your heart melt.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.380]   I think there must have been an oxytocin dump at that moment that's probably happening right
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.380]   now.
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:16.220]   But if you want the monkeys to like you, you have to give an affiliative facial gesture,
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.380]   which is not a smile.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.140]   That's actually an aggressive gesture.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:24.240]   So as Karen, Dr. Parker just showed you, it's lip smacking, which is, yep.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.720]   So if you see a monkey at the zoo and you want it to pay attention to you, you're going
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.780]   to have to lip smack.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:32.580]   And if it doesn't, either you're not doing it right or it just doesn't like you.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.580]   Exactly.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.580]   Right.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.580]   Great.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.580]   All right.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.580]   Thanks.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:39.980]   Now we'll go back to the study of, or the establishment of this really key experiment.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:40.980]   Right.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:44.960]   So then what we did is we identified these animals and we spent a lot of time.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:51.240]   So one of the things that I do as one of my areas of expertise is validating animal models.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.920]   So a lot of, like I mentioned, like a lot of reason why experiments fail is people will
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.340]   take an animal off the shelf and say, "Oh, I'm going to do this."
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.340]   Right.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.280]   But if you're, you know, if you're studying a disorder that's characterized by visual
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.700]   issues, is it the best thing to do in a nocturnal species that has olfaction as its primary
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:12.700]   sensory modality?
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.700]   Or is it-
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.700]   You're referring to mice.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.700]   Right.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:17.780]   Or is it better, you know, and again, I will say all models have value.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.500]   There's all, you know, there's reasons you just have to, you know, you basically have
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.420]   to stand by what you're modeling.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:28.340]   And so I think one of my, the biggest issues I have with this sort of mouse phenotyping
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.260]   mafia is that, you know, there's this group of tests that they use and they use it in
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:33.260]   every single disorder.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:34.260]   Right.
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:36.700]   And then if there was a positive hit, it's like, "Oh, this is like, you know, this test
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.940]   is really for Parkinson's today, but it's for depression tomorrow."
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.940]   Right.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:46.860]   And so, so my goal was to, to devise very specific tests that would allow us to evaluate,
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:49.100]   you know, core features of autism in this model.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:50.660]   And the answer is we found it, right?
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:54.980]   So if you look at monkeys that spend a lot of time alone, they have a much greater burden
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:58.460]   of autistic-like traits measuring on this rating scale.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.760]   They have diminished social motivations.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.140]   So other monkeys will come up and interact with them, but they don't engage in social
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.460]   overtures that much themselves.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.940]   They do less grooming, less affiliative behaviors.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.820]   They, in some of the work that we're doing, they don't lip smack back and we can talk
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.820]   a little bit about that.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:21.260]   We did a pharmacological probe and we can talk a bit about what vasopressin does to
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.260]   that, which is kind of exciting.
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:27.460]   And so we spent a lot of time validating this behavioral phenotype, right?
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:34.380]   To say that we really feel like there are core aspects of it that are allowing us to
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.380]   model autism.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.380]   Right.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.580]   And I have a paper, which if you want to put it in, it's all about creating this monkey
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:44.500]   model and the power of doing it and where it took us clinically.
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.580]   We'll provide a link to that in the show note captions.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:53.000]   I also just want to throw up my vote for the fact that you did this work, because again,
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.420]   I don't disparage mouse model work, but we've just seen over and over again that the incredibly
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:02.420]   small fraction of mouse models that lead to valid therapeutics in humans, and that there's
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:08.120]   just a lot of differences between primate brains and rodent brains, and we have a very
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.120]   elaborate frontal cortex, a bunch of other circuitry that mice, if they have that, they
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.740]   probably use it for other things.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:19.720]   And it's just very hard to draw conclusions from those models.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:26.180]   And they're great for probing functions that are, let's just call them more autonomic type
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.140]   functions and for doing some of the initial investigations.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:37.100]   But I think while I don't want to see every research lab switch over to primates, I think
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:41.220]   one has to be really thoughtful about the kinds of experiments one does with primates
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:49.020]   at all, this sort of behavioral assessment and the identification of a primate model
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:53.720]   for autism seems like a very good use of human resources.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.720]   Right.
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.380]   Well, and the other thing I will say is that there were medications that were only tested
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:04.580]   in rodents that when they were tested in people had really negative consequences.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.580]   I can give you two examples.
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:11.400]   So one is thalidomide, which was a morning sickness medication that was given to women
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.060]   that were pregnant.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.620]   And the safety testing and toxicity testing was done only in mice.
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:17.620]   I didn't know that.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   Yes.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:19.620]   And that's why it went on the market.
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.140]   It went on the market in Europe.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:25.600]   And there were all these children born with profound limb abnormalities.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:32.560]   When they went back and tested the drug in marmosets, neither rhesus monkeys or cinnamologous
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.420]   monkeys, an old world monkey, they had the limb abnormalities.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:41.660]   And so all they had to do, and again, I as an animal lover treat the life of a single
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.740]   monkey or a single mouse for that matter, an individual monkey, excuse me, or individual
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:49.900]   mouse for that matter as critical.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:50.900]   I am a speciesist.
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:56.620]   I do think there's a difference between their life and our lives when it comes to what study
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:03.360]   one does, but just the idea that these severe developmental defects in humans could have
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.740]   been avoided by doing an experiment, perhaps even on one marmoset.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:14.340]   And again, I feel for the life of discomfort of that marmoset, but the idea that that could
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:17.660]   have saved so many human lives is just striking.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:23.640]   Well, and there was also that street drug MPTP that was a synthetic heroin that causes
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.460]   like overnight Parkinsonianism, when I think the dopamine cells were just ablated, right?
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:33.220]   But when you went and looked in mice, MPTP didn't have those effects.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:36.580]   It was only in primates and other humans and other primates, right?
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:39.300]   So, and I agree with you, I am an animal lover.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.380]   I think that we have to be very careful whenever we do any animal experiments, right?
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:48.540]   And so you really need to have a good justification, I think, for any science that's done.
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.380]   I will say that upfront.
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:55.920]   And we have this new generation of stem cell and organoid work, which I think is going
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.340]   to allow us to make all kinds of disease progress, right?
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.760]   Without having to study whole animal models.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.640]   Or in complementary, right?
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.960]   But I mean, I think, again, I think we need to pick the model based on the question we're
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.060]   asking, right?
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:19.120]   And so if you want to have a medication that's safe and well tolerated in people or effective,
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:23.120]   and you want to move the needle on complex social cognition, you want to be testing it
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.820]   in a species that also has complex social cognition.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.280]   Look, the Netflix show, Chimp Empire, if people haven't seen it, they should watch it.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.420]   When you watch it, you realize they're very much like us, and dare I say, we're very much
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.420]   like them.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.820]   It's far and away different than watching a bunch of mice.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:40.820]   Yes.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.820]   And I'm not being disparaging of mice.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.200]   I'm assuming they have, that mice also have complex social cognition, voles also have
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.100]   complex social cognition, but it's of the mouse vole type.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.520]   And we don't know really even what to look for, right?
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:56.880]   But with primates, there's, you know, affiliative gaze, there's, you know, affiliative grooming,
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.760]   there's ostracization of individuals in the troop.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.200]   I mean, there's a, you know, banding, taking care of other babies.
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:09.200]   There's all sorts of interesting dynamics that map so clearly onto human behavior and
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200]   vice versa.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:18.280]   So you establish this colony up at Davis at the regional primate center that, where you
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:23.580]   identified some monkeys that we don't know if they have autism, but you could see that
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:25.120]   they were less socially affiliative.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:26.120]   Right.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.120]   And I would never say they have autism.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:33.180]   Like I will say that upfront, you know, they have features that resemble human autism and
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.360]   that allow us to model this, right?
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:41.420]   So we started studying those animals and what we wanted to do was do some biomarker discovery.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:46.640]   So what we wanted to ask was, are there any molecules that allow us to differentiate these,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.300]   but we'll call them naturally low social or low social monkeys, from socially competent
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.040]   high social monkeys?
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.760]   And so we measured a bunch of different readouts of neurotransmitter systems that were either
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:04.660]   involved in mammalian social behavior, had been implicated in idiopathic, meaning autism
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:09.420]   that doesn't have a genetic cause or these neurogenetic syndromes that we've been talking
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:13.120]   about where there's pathways that are really associated with them.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:18.820]   And so if we measured a bunch of these systems with 93% accuracy without even knowing what
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:22.440]   the monkey, who the monkey was, if they were low or high social, we could just put them
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.480]   in the low social or high social bucket.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.560]   And was this by blood draw or cerebral spinal fluid?
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.800]   So this was, it was everything.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.140]   We did blood, we did CSF, and we put all these measures into the hopper.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.380]   We did a discriminant statistical analysis, which was like a machine learning algorithm
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.160]   where we just said, here's all this information.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.840]   Help me classify if this individual is high or low social.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.440]   Cerebral spinal fluid is collected by spinal tap, correct?
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:50.400]   And my understanding, I've never had one, but that spinal tap is of course more invasive
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:56.160]   than a blood draw, but it still is done as an outpatient thing in humans.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:01.240]   Like you can go in and get a needle inserted into the lower spine by an expert.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.300]   They're going to draw cerebral spinal fluid.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:09.840]   I mean not that much more invasive and time consuming than getting a needle into your
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.080]   vein for a blood draw, right?
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:19.680]   I mean it's, we think of it as, it's technically a little bit more challenging, but there's
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.080]   CSF draws in humans all the time.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.700]   So in theory this could map to a human study.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.760]   And it did, which we'll talk about.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:32.000]   So we went out and we did this, I have a spectacular statistician who's, we spent a lot of time
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]   together.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.160]   His name's Joe Garner and he is a statistical genius.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:41.400]   And so he developed this and we do all of our work together, or I would say 95% of it.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.200]   We just love working together.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:48.640]   And he developed a statistical winnowing strategy to identify what were the key drivers.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.060]   And what was fascinating is in this first monkey cohort, it was the cerebral spinal
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:58.400]   fluid levels of vasopressin that were really what was driving this classification, right?
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:03.160]   So if we just knew your levels of your, of vasopressin in spinal fluid, but not in blood
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:10.080]   interestingly, we could pretty closely perfect to perfect classify you as high or low social.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.340]   And so then we replicated that again in another monkey cohort, because obviously as a scientist
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:16.560]   you always want to replicate your work.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.640]   And then if it was really a biomarker, meaning it's a molecule in the body that gives us
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.520]   an indication of something, and in this case it's an indication of your social functioning,
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.720]   we were able to look at monkeys and we saw that the vasopressin was consistent across
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.820]   measurement time.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:38.200]   So there was a wide variety of vasopressin levels, but within an individual monkey it
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.540]   was pretty much the same, right?
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:41.740]   So that's what you want to see with the biomarker.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:49.920]   And then we showed that the vasopressin levels were closely linked to time spent in grooming.
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:54.600]   And as we mentioned, I think we mentioned earlier, grooming is in many monkey species,
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.020]   a critical behavior that solidifies social bonds and maintains them.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:05.000]   And so the individuals with the lowest CSF vasopressin levels had spent the least amount
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]   of time in grooming.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000]   Grooming other monkeys.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000]   Other monkeys, yes.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000]   And that's another-
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.620]   Allopathic grooming is a very interesting behavior from watching Chimp Empire, I can
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:15.280]   tell you that.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:21.540]   New relationships are established in many ways by monkeys, these chimps, chimpanzees,
[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:23.420]   sort of offering their back for grooming.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:29.880]   And if another chimp elects to, yes, groom that chimp, then it establishes some form
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.240]   of trust.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.680]   And it all seems to have to do with proximity, like how close are you going to let me get
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.680]   to you, vice versa.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.360]   In humans, we talk about personal space and there's a whole set of things related to consent
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.140]   in this whole allopathic grooming thing.
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:49.780]   And then if a chimp misbehaves on an outing, then they aren't groomed by others and they
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:54.120]   can actually get parasitic infections and it can be very costly.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:52:02.680]   It's very interesting to just think of allopathic grooming as not a kind of a primitive of language,
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.440]   but a whole language into itself.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.440]   Absolutely.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440]   And also just critical for the species.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.440]   So that was really interesting to me that we were seeing these hints that vasopressin
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.640]   could be really important.
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:19.280]   But of course, somebody will say, and I will say upfront, monkeys don't have autism, right?
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.380]   So then the question becomes, does this have what's called translational value?
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:30.520]   So can I see this observation in animal model and will it provide fundamental insights into
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.520]   humans, right?
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.480]   So I wanted to get cerebral spinal fluid from people to test this hypothesis because we
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:43.740]   had in parallel done a study looking at blood vasopressin levels in people without autism.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:47.880]   And we didn't see a group difference there, unlike this really profound difference that
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.000]   we saw when we looked at spinal fluid in the monkeys.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.280]   And again, I think I mentioned the blood vasopressin levels were indistinguishable if you were
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.800]   high or low social monkeys.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.680]   So there was something about looking more proximate to the brain that was giving us
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.800]   more information than say the blood alone.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.160]   And so I said I wanted to get spinal fluid.
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.020]   And like you said, people do this all the time.
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:11.640]   How would we, but we're, you know, it's not going to be a first pass, especially when
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:16.300]   we don't really have any evidence in people to go in for what we would call a research
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.760]   lumbar puncture, right?
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:23.880]   And so I had to get really creative about how do I get spinal fluid from children?
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:32.120]   And what we did was we piggybacked onto a clinical indication for spinal fluid draws.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.120]   And we did this.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.120]   So I tried to get funding for this.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.760]   This is like, you know, again, I mean, I think this is important for people to know how science
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]   is done, right?
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.480]   And so I wrote all these grant applications, nobody would fund it.
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:45.760]   They said that this is really interesting, it's too high risk, you won't be able to pull
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:46.760]   it off.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.440]   And, you know, I don't usually back down from a challenge.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.440]   Like if I think something's a good idea and I want to do it, I'm going to find a way to
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440]   do it.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.660]   And if it's possible, that's one thing.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:57.160]   But if it's hard to do, it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:59.080]   You just have to figure out how to do it.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:03.720]   And so I always try to see bridges where other people see barriers, right?
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:05.800]   And so it's like, well, how can I access spinal fluid?
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:10.400]   And so I went around talking to all my friends who were on, and Stanford's really wonderful
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.600]   because it's such a small school, right?
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.880]   And so you're on all these different committees with all these different people.
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.880]   And so...
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.880]   A lot of committees.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:18.880]   Lots of committees.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:19.880]   I can attest.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.880]   A lot of committees.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:21.880]   Exactly.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:22.880]   But it's really cool because you're on them with people from all different departments.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.880]   You're on departments that I wouldn't otherwise know.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.400]   And you get to know these people well in these many committees.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.400]   And where we live, it's a small community, right?
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400]   So like...
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.480]   Maybe we're the experiment, Karen.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480]   Maybe there's a...
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.520]   I always wonder whether or not there's a larger experiment, right?
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.840]   Not on monkeys, not on the patients or the clinical, but like maybe we're the experiment,
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.840]   right?
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.840]   I mean, yeah.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.840]   And they're looking at how we interact on committees.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.840]   Anyway, please continue.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.120]   So I started going up to people that I knew and said, "Hey, if you're taking spinal fluid,
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.240]   can I get a little bit of extra?"
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.880]   And of course, we got IRB approval, meaning we had ethics approval and all this.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:02.680]   Or you could get the remnant sample and obviously, again, get consent from the families.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:07.420]   So we could either get a little bit extra when it was being drawn for a research indication.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.720]   So they were getting a spinal tap no matter what.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.720]   And then we were just either...
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.400]   We're getting a little bit extra or we were going to getting the remnant that they were
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.400]   going to throw out, right?
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.340]   So you usually take more than you need because you don't want to have to do another spinal
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.400]   tap, right?
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.240]   And so we were able to go around and I hustled around and got all these people involved to
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.240]   help me.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:31.880]   We put hot pink stickers on the lumbar puncture trays so that in the emergency room, so if
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.240]   somebody was doing a spinal tap, they would call us so we knew about it and we could get
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.560]   samples, again, under people's consent.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.740]   So we got all these people involved and we finally got samples from children with autism
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:48.380]   and children without autism.
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:52.740]   And then we also made sure that whatever they were being worked up for was negative, right?
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:57.040]   So we got the sort of healthiest people we could, given that everybody was coming in
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.560]   for a medical reason to have a lumbar puncture.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:06.180]   And in this first study, we had seven children with autism, seven children without autism,
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:11.560]   and we could nearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14 individuals by just knowing their
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.380]   CSF vasopressin level alone, which is pretty remarkable given that there isn't a biological
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.780]   indicator that we, a robust biological indicator that we know.
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:27.960]   So basically in this relatively small cohort, having low vasopressin is a biomarker of autism.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]   Correct.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:34.240]   And again, and what I will say is in our monkey studies and in our human studies, CSF oxytocin
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:36.580]   level became our control, right?
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:41.400]   So in our monkeys, there were no difference in CSF oxytocin by group.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:47.600]   And then in this first study, there were no differences in CSF oxytocin levels.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.200]   A sample size of 14 is intriguing, but given autism so clinically heterogeneous, we want
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.200]   to replicate it.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:02.520]   And so I knew that there was a professor at the NIH named Sue Sweeto who was collecting
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.640]   cerebral spinal fluid as part of a research study because she was interested in immune
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.920]   parameters and folate deficiency.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:15.120]   So she had children that were medically healthy and they were getting, just like at NIH, get
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.280]   these huge workups, right?
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:19.000]   So they were very well characterized participants.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.600]   So we were able to look at, and again, we also, this is the first time we were able
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   to look at girls.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.440]   So we had a small sample of girls and we had boys and we basically just asked the question,
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.080]   can we replicate this?
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:35.420]   And I was very interested in will oxytocin be what's different in the girls, right?
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:40.580]   So maybe there will be some sex specificity here and it will see low CSF vasopressin in
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:43.880]   the males and low CSF oxytocin in girls.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:44.880]   That was not the case.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:50.460]   What we found was that if in the individuals with autism, regardless of their biological
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:56.880]   sex, that they all had lower CSF vasopressin levels than the individuals without autism.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:02.140]   And because they were so well characterized, we were also able to show on a gold standard
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.700]   research diagnostic assessment of autism.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:12.480]   So it's an assessment that's used in a research situation to validate an autism diagnosis
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.880]   by an expert clinical opinion that the lower your vasopressin levels in spinal fluid, the
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:23.500]   greater your social symptom severity, your clinical symptom severity.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:28.040]   And then we asked, it's like, well, vasopressin's involved in social behavior, but it's not
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:30.720]   really that involved in restricted repetitive behaviors.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.760]   And that was actually the case.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:37.160]   So it was the CSF vasopressin track the social symptom severity, not the repetitive symptom
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:43.060]   severity, suggesting that there might be other biological measures that could be included
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:49.240]   as a way to have a more powerful way to differentiate people with and without autism.
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:54.180]   And so then I was really, so that was really exciting to replicate that.
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:58.860]   And then I had a colleague named John Constantino, who is now at Emory, but he used to be at
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:58:59.860]   Wash U.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:04.040]   And I knew that, John, I had been at a meeting in, I think it was 2010, and I found out that
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:06.840]   he had what I will call liquid gold.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:15.720]   So he had this minus 80 C freezer that was, had a bunch of neonatal infant CSF samples
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:18.680]   that he had from human infants.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.640]   And he had collected them, and again, this was under ethical approvals, and it was basically
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:29.480]   these infants came in for something that needed to be worked up that was very rare.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:33.280]   But if they had it, they would, they could die, so they needed to get a medical treatment
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.280]   for it.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:37.800]   But the vast majority of these children ended up being healthy.
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.300]   So it was a pretty healthy sample, if you will, right?
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:45.280]   And so I knew he had all these samples, and I said to him, wouldn't it be really interesting
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:53.580]   if we teamed up and we look at this CSF vasopressin finding in children before the period when
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:56.040]   behavioral symptoms first manifest, right?
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.040]   And so-
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.040]   Yeah, so, sorry again to-
[01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.040]   Sorry, am I getting too jargony?
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:03.520]   No, no, I just, but I think it's important because this was a question that I was thinking
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.120]   about earlier, and I imagine many other people were too.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:10.120]   You find these monkeys that have social interaction deficits.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:15.620]   You find kids that have social interaction deficits, and you see that there's low vasopressin
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.780]   in both groups.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:19.360]   This extends to male and female children.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.920]   But then of course, the question becomes, well, maybe they have low vasopressin because
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.280]   of so many years or even months of social interaction deficits, right?
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.360]   The direction of causality isn't clear.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:37.160]   And so when you said liquid gold, referring to the CSF from these infants taken prior
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.980]   to any opportunity for social interaction beyond just whatever interaction they had
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:47.000]   with their mother up until the point the CSF draw was taken, this really gets at the issue
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000]   of causality.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000]   Right.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.380]   So it's a quasi perspective because it was banked and then a lot of time went by, right?
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:58.460]   And so what we realized we could do was, and this was a heroic undertaking on John's part.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:03.120]   So these samples were collected back on paper medical records.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.900]   So he had to trace 2,000 paper-- Paper?
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:06.900]   What's that?
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:13.000]   So he had to trace 2,000, I think, paper medical records to an electronic medical record.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.620]   And then what we did is he looked to see who went on to develop autism and who didn't,
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:19.620]   right?
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:23.680]   And he had with spinal fluid samples that have sort of been waiting in the freezer,
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680]   if you will.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:30.480]   And then we could ask, do individuals who later receive an autism diagnosis many months
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.200]   or even years later already have low vasopressin levels as infants?
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:39.900]   And the reason why this was a compelling question to ask is there's evidence to suggest that
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:44.460]   behavioral therapies are more effective the younger the child is, right?
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:51.480]   And if you think about it, if behavioral characteristics of autism emerge across development, what
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:58.400]   if-- and this is sort of my-- we haven't substantiated this yet, but this is sort of my big question.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.600]   What if all these autism susceptibility genes summon, interact, and converge upon a few
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.440]   common pathways in the brain, right?
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.700]   And so for years, people have talked about this excitatory inhibitory balance theory
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:10.960]   of autism.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.760]   But what if vasopressin is one of those pathways because it's so critically involved in social
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:16.860]   functioning?
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.380]   And so what I was interested in-- and so let's just say for a moment, your genes are set
[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:22.380]   at birth.
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:26.140]   What if the vasopressin is already low in the brains of these infants?
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:31.300]   And so it puts them on this very different trajectory where you have this cumulative
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.980]   effect of there may be a little bit less socially interested, and maybe they're not making the
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:36.980]   eye contact.
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:41.240]   And if there was a way to intervene really early, even potentially with a vasopressin
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.760]   replacement therapy, that you might be able to put them on a different developmental trajectory.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.720]   So that was my big what if question.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:54.240]   And what was really remarkable was-- so I had been asking John, hey, can I have your
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.680]   spinal fluid samples?
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:59.120]   And he finally agreed after he saw a couple of those papers, understandably he wanted
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:03.460]   to make sure that we already had shown something in people and animals that were sort of, if
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.960]   you will, symptomatic with social impairment.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.880]   And what we found was, yes, this was the case.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.140]   So it was a small sample.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:10.740]   It needs to be replicated.
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:16.800]   But individual-- so infants that went on to have an autism diagnosis later in life already
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.980]   had low CSF vasopressin levels.
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:25.280]   Oxytocin levels did not differ between infants that received a subsequent autism diagnosis
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.640]   and those that didn't.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:34.140]   So suggesting that we have a biomarker that might really be a good readout for clinical
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:36.320]   referral or risk management monitoring.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:37.320]   Incredible.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:45.600]   So you're telling us that levels of vasopressin correlate with social cognition deficits.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:47.640]   Is that right?
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.960]   I think that warrants a brief discussion about cerebral spinal fluid.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.080]   I teach neuroanatomy to medical students, so forgive me for having to ask this.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.460]   But I think of cerebral spinal fluid as the stuff that exists in the ventricles and down
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:07.420]   the central canal of the spinal cord and provides essential nutrients for neurons and other
[02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:09.800]   cell types in the brain.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:16.120]   But it's also a reservoir for chemicals coming from the brain, which is why the spinal tap
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.620]   is useful.
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:26.040]   But in the context of a cerebral spinal tap and you're measuring CSF and you're seeing,
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:31.940]   you know, lower levels of vasopressin in these individuals with these challenges with social
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:36.440]   deficits, does that mean that they're making less vasopressin?
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:38.540]   Does it mean, I mean, it could have gone the other way too.
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:42.100]   Like they're dumping too much vasopressin into the CSF and it's not able to function
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.100]   in the brain.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.240]   What do we know about CSF and what does it mean?
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240]   Right.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240]   Well, I mean, it's a great question.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.780]   So I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, right?
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:57.880]   So I think of the CSF is as sort of like the kitchen sink of the brain, right?
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:00.200]   And what we need is real specificity.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:05.700]   And so, I mean, my working hypothesis, and we'll talk a little bit about pharmacology,
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:12.640]   is that there's a deficiency in vasopressin production in individuals with autism, but
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:17.320]   there's a lot of elegant experiments that need to be done to be able to answer this
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.320]   question.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:26.720]   So I'm standing currently to look in post-mortem human brain tissue, to look at in both blood
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:33.680]   CSF and hypothalamic tissue where vasopressin is made, to look at interrelationships, right,
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:39.600]   which is very difficult to do, but also to see if there's a fewer number of vasopressin-producing
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.800]   cells and if vasopressin gene expression is diminished, right?
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:46.920]   Because that would help us begin to answer, is this a production issue, right?
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:52.480]   So if you think back to the prairie voles, they're sort of primed to be parental, right?
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:54.940]   Or in my case, the meadow voles, right?
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:59.040]   But you can do this in any vole species, or at least the two that I'm thinking of.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.640]   And you put vasopressin into the brain, and then all of a sudden it unlocks this behavior,
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:04.640]   right?
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.680]   So is it possible that children with autism, or at least a subset of them, all you have
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:15.360]   to do is replace vasopressin and that there might be a subset of these kids minimally
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.380]   that could benefit from vasopressin replacement, if you will.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:24.460]   - Is there any evidence for excessive urination in kids with autism?
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:27.980]   Which if anyone's going, what, why is he asking that?
[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:31.840]   If you recall, vasopressin is also anti-diuretic hormone.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:37.440]   I suppose the other question is, could you, has anyone looked at levels of vasopressin
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:41.200]   in the urine of autistic kids versus non-autistic kids?
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:46.360]   Because it's acting peripherally, and you said blood draws don't reveal any differences
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.040]   in circulating blood.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:55.240]   We know that urine is filtered blood, fair enough, but seems at least worth the look-see.
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:07:00.120]   - So I had this awesome medical student in my lab named Lauren Clark, and we, with three
[02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:05.140]   different physicians from different backgrounds, so wrote a perspective piece that's currently
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.820]   under review, and it actually asked this question.
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:15.380]   So given all these weird medical naming conventions, it's possible that this information is existing
[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:18.740]   in information silos in different disciplines, right?
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:26.500]   So it raises this idea of if you have low vasopressin, so if you really don't have,
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:30.740]   you're not making vasopressin, you have a disorder called central diabetes insipidus,
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:39.960]   right, which is characterized by excessive thirst, lots of urination, and bedwetting
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:41.720]   potentially.
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:45.380]   And so what we wanted to do was ask, has this been missed, right?
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:49.440]   So shouldn't there be a subset of kids with autism where we might be able to look at these
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:55.080]   other physiological features and say, yeah, this is the subset we want to be giving vasopressin
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:56.080]   to?
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:59.400]   And so she wrote this perspective where we did a little bit of a review, and the answer
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:05.660]   is there's some intriguing studies that we reviewed in this paper where it looks like,
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:09.300]   and what's funny is when you read the discussion section, it'll be like, wow, there's all these
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:15.040]   kids with autism that are drinking lots of water, and we don't know why, or wow, there's
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:19.200]   a lot of bedwetting, but it's not tied to intellectual disability where you might see
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.860]   a lot of bedwetting or something.
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:25.780]   So all of these studies kind of raise this point of like, wow, this is really interesting,
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:30.020]   and there's been no big epidemiological study done on this, and certainly not any study
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:35.880]   where people who come at it from brain science and then the practitioners who are like an
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:41.900]   endocrinologist for instance, which is where some of these people could show up, are really
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.180]   connecting the dots.
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:48.280]   So I think that remains to be determined, but we are actually about to launch a study
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:49.780]   to investigate this, right?
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:53.860]   I was meeting with Lauren yesterday about it, so it's a really good question, and I
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:57.420]   hope to have information on it in the not too distant future.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:01.880]   As I recall, alcohol is an antagonist of vasopressin.
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:06.300]   So there's a lot of different drugs that could interact with vasopressin, and so one thing
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:11.740]   I'm interested in is, are there any drugs that release vasopressin as a side effect,
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.460]   and could some of them be mobilized to treat autism?
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:18.780]   We also know that acupuncture can release vasopressin.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.860]   There's been some studies done in rats on that.
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:27.220]   And so one question would just be, are there any alternative therapies where we can be
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:33.140]   releasing vasopressin naturally, or do we need to do a replacement study where we give
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:36.180]   intranasal vasopressin to children with autism, right?
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.260]   And of course, I want to say I'm not advocating that people go out and do this on their own,
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:41.260]   right?
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.700]   Like I'm a big proponent of randomized clinical trials where you assess safety and advocacy.
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:47.700]   Science.
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:48.700]   Yes, science.
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:49.700]   Science and medicine, right.
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:50.700]   But I appreciate you saying that.
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:59.860]   So some years ago, so this would be mid-90s, there was a small but very active subculture
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:10.060]   that I was not a part of, I swear, that were combining GHB, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:15.020]   vasopressin as combination, quote unquote, sex drugs.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:16.020]   Really?
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:17.020]   Yes.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:21.820]   And I don't know what the rationale for including vasopressin was.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:26.700]   In any case, whether or not that's by way of enhancing social bonding or a direct effect
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:29.500]   on sexual arousal itself is still unclear.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.980]   But in any event, since we're talking about vasopressin, maybe you should tell us about
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:35.180]   the actual science of vasopressin.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:36.180]   Sorry.
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:41.140]   Maybe I should allow you to tell us about the actual scientific study of vasopressin.
[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:46.260]   In other words, what happens if you give people vasopressin in a controlled environment?
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.300]   That's the sort of environment I'm talking about, but a controlled environment.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:51.580]   And the one thing I will say, because I have people contact us all the time saying, where
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:52.580]   can I get vasopressin?
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:58.640]   And what I would say is, vasopressin means you're having effects on blood pressure, you're
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.060]   having effects on really important-- Right, vasode, vasculature.
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.060]   Right.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.820]   And the dosing has to be appropriate.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:10.140]   You don't want people just going and trying this, because there could be really severe
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.420]   adverse effects, right?
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:16.220]   So that's why we've been studying this in a controlled clinical trial, right?
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:20.920]   So I teamed up with Antonio Harden, who's the child psychiatrist that I've been working
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.160]   with for years.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.160]   And we did the first, sort of first in class, vasopressin treatment trial in children with
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:28.160]   autism.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.980]   So again, this was-- everyone was unaware of who was on vasopressin, whether it was
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:36.820]   the family or the clinician who was doing the evaluation.
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:40.140]   And then it was randomized, placebo controlled.
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:45.620]   And then we basically gave vasopressin, again, twice a day for four weeks to children.
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:48.140]   They were about six to 12 years of age.
[02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:52.620]   And then we had a primary outcome measure, which was the social responsiveness scale.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:57.260]   We could get into discussions about what a primary outcome measure should be, wouldn't
[02:11:57.260 --> 02:12:00.220]   it be great if there was a biological measure?
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:04.460]   But this is sort of what had been used in the past and something that the FDA approved
[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:05.780]   us using.
[02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:10.680]   I was partly interested in using the SRS because we had used it in monkeys, right?
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.580]   And we had shown, at least in monkeys, we've never looked at this in people because of
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:17.820]   the lack of available samples.
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:22.940]   But in monkeys, in this general population that we've looked at, there is a continuous
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:29.160]   distribution of these SRS scores that relate to the CSF vasopressin levels.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:35.240]   And so what was-- I wanted to know if we use the SRS as an outcome measure and we're administering
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.660]   vasopressin, can we change the scoring on this instrument based on our animal data?
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:46.700]   So SRS is social responsiveness scale without going into a lot of detail because we can
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.420]   always refer people to the paper.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:51.340]   And I think most people just want to understand the top contour.
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:58.620]   The SRS presumably has to do with how often the kid interacts with another kid, how often
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:04.260]   they initiate that interaction versus on the receiving end, things like affiliative play,
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:09.180]   how often they look at one another versus averting gaze, these kinds of things.
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:13.140]   And then there's also a little bit about restrictive repetitive behaviors.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:18.240]   So even though it's called the social responsiveness scale, there is also an assessment of other
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.820]   features of autism in it.
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:26.280]   But you can sort of think about it as a quantitative way to assess features of interest in autism.
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.840]   And this was related to our biology in the monkeys.
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:34.020]   And so then we use this as this outcome measure in our trial.
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:39.500]   And as an experimentalist, I have this sort of trust but verify, right?
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:43.380]   So you want to see the same thing over and over and over again, right, like scientists
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:44.400]   like repetition.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:53.700]   And so we had parents fill out their impressions of what the child's behavior was before and
[02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:55.700]   after being on the medication.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:01.980]   We also had a clinician make an evaluation, but we also had the kids perform laboratory
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:07.860]   based tests where they would see, like I mentioned, the reading the mind and the eyes test, or
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:11.900]   we would show them a picture of a face and say, "What emotion is this?"
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:16.020]   And so we were able to have what's called convergent validity, right?
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:20.100]   So it's a fancy scientific term to say, "Do all these measures that we think should
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.620]   be related, are they related and are we seeing the same thing?"
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:30.300]   And the answer was yes, so that when we gave children with autism vasopressin versus kids
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:35.900]   with autism of placebo, the kids who were treated with vasopressin showed increases
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:41.660]   in social abilities on parent report, clinician evaluation, and child performance on laboratory
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:44.820]   based tests.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:45.900]   Was that immediate?
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:52.340]   Like they did the nasal spray and they immediately started receiving and initiating more social
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.660]   engagement or was this a buildup over time?
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:59.860]   And what I'm getting at here is whether or not this is the reflection of short or longer
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:04.560]   term neuroplasticity, like were there structural changes in the brain or is this something
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:06.200]   that was more acute?
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.540]   We don't know the answer to that.
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:11.820]   So we basically looked at dosing with the idea that we would, and again, I think we've
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:17.000]   mentioned this about limitations on, like there's so many things that a scientist would
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.980]   like to do, but you were always limited by a budget, right?
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:24.540]   And so when we started this work, again, it was like philanthropic shoestring budgets,
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:25.540]   right?
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:29.320]   And so you had to really be laser focused on what are the things that we can do on the
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.320]   budget at hand.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.860]   So unfortunately we didn't do like EEG or brain imaging or other things that would be,
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:39.940]   I think, potentially very interesting to do because you might be able to see an early
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:41.640]   signature of response, right?
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:45.580]   So maybe after the first dose, let's say, wow, like there's some interesting changes
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:49.460]   that are predictive of somebody who would be a responder to the medication.
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:56.340]   And we don't know that yet, but we do know after this four week period that we saw these
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:57.340]   changes.
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:02.600]   In the last set of kids, we actually saw diminished anxiety and also diminished restricted repetitive
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:03.600]   behaviors.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:10.180]   So suggesting that the vasopressin effect may not only be on social behavior.
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:15.280]   Have you ever just wanted to try or tried vasopressin?
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.280]   You know, I haven't, but I-
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:20.040]   You're in a psychiatry department after all, and I'm not suggesting that members of the
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:23.180]   psychiatry department are constantly testing the drugs that they use on their patients
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:28.880]   with themselves, but I've had several members of this department, of which I'm a courtesy
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:33.140]   member, member by courtesy, in any event, and we'll see if I still am after what I'm
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:38.680]   about to say, Dr. Carl Deisseroth, who's a clinician, our first guest on the Huberman
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:48.640]   Lab podcast, also a phenomenal neurobiology researcher, David Spiegel, Rob Malenka, and
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:51.220]   others that I've spoken to.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:56.240]   You know, I think all of whom said, you know, that they felt as clinicians, Rob's not a
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:57.760]   clinician anymore, right?
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.280]   But as a clinician, that they felt almost a responsibility to understand the effects
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.420]   and side effect profiles of the drugs that they were giving their patients, which I saw
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:12.080]   not as renegade or experimental, but rather as very compassionate, like seeking empathy.
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:14.440]   So I'm curious, have you ever just snuck a little roll?
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:15.440]   No?
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:16.440]   No, I never have.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:22.240]   There is a long history in medicine of people trying out, they believe so much in their
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:27.320]   solution that they go and vaccinate their family with the new vaccine that they've created
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.620]   or they try the medication themselves, right?
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:30.620]   So I don't-
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:35.160]   Well, MDMA was developed by Sasha Colgan in a laboratory in the East Bay, first by a pharmaceutical
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.060]   company in the early 1900s, but then kind of disappeared, it did disappear, and then
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:43.880]   it was resurrected independently in the, in the 19, I think '70s and '80s, and then now
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:49.640]   it's one of the sort of hot topic items for the treatment of PTSD.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:55.480]   Still in late phase clinical trial, still illegal, but self-experimentation is one of
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.480]   the central themes of psychiatry, frankly.
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:17:58.480]   Right.
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:17:59.480]   Yeah.
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:04.360]   I mean, I guess I got in trouble in class for being too social, right?
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.360]   So I guess I've never-
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:06.920]   They might send you over the other side.
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:07.920]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:08.920]   Who knows?
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:14.400]   But I never know, and the thing is, is that these oxytocin and vasopressin, and again,
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.680]   these are done, and this is something that I think we've hit on over and over again in
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:21.360]   the podcast, is you need to know who's you're studying, right?
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:22.440]   What's the species?
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:23.840]   Who's the individual?
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.180]   You know, most of these have been done in neuro, I mean, a lot of the oxytocin and a
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:33.560]   little bit of the vasopressin work, the single dose work, was mostly done in what we'll call
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.240]   neuro-typical people, right?
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:41.360]   Just asking, "Can we move around social behavior by just giving the single drug administration?"
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.600]   Most people that are neuro-typical didn't say that they could tell if they were on the
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:47.080]   drug or the placebo, right?
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:48.080]   Interesting.
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:53.240]   So I think the question really becomes, you know, drugs have different, you know, they
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.400]   work differently based on the individual who's taking them.
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.920]   So if you have a neuro-typical individual and you give them vasopressin, you know, maybe
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.840]   they'll self-report that they don't see a difference.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:09.040]   But if you had somebody who isn't producing enough vasopressin, maybe, you know, they
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.920]   would self-report after a period of time or maybe even after the first dose, "Wow, I really
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.780]   see something different," right?
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:18.280]   Did any of the kids report how they felt?
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:22.800]   They just said like, "Wow, I like playing with other kids more."
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:24.840]   Were they self-aware in that way?
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:31.360]   And also feel free to mention, if it feels right to you, any, let's consider two outlier
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:32.360]   cases.
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.000]   One spectacular result of that, you know, a kid that went from very socially isolated
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.860]   to, you know, maybe very gregarious.
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:45.940]   But let's also balance that with another outlier, the kid with low vasopressin who took vasopressin
[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:47.520]   for whom there was no significant shift.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:52.040]   I'm presuming that within the data set, you probably observe something like each of those.
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:53.040]   Yeah.
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:57.640]   So, I mean, what I'll say is that, so yeah, I mean, there were definitely kids who didn't
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:58.640]   respond to the medication.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:03.080]   I mean, one thing I think it's important to say, and again, this was a small pilot trial,
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:04.080]   right?
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:07.680]   We're in the process of replicating this in a much larger sample.
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:11.160]   So, you know, as a scientist, again, you want to say, "Okay, this is really intriguing and
[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:15.680]   interesting and I've invested a lot in, you know, this monkey model and then doing all
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:20.680]   the CSF work in patients to suggest that there may be a there there here, but I want to see
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.240]   it replicate."
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:29.760]   We did have an article that Stanford Medicine, I can send you the link, they were able to,
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.620]   I think, interview a family that had been in the trial.
[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:37.320]   And so obviously there's patient privacy and, you know, you have to, they have to say it's
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:40.360]   okay to talk about it, but this is a family that was contacted.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:44.240]   I think they were anonymous, but this is in this report.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:48.680]   And they basically said, the dad said that his son was walking around the, he was on
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:53.640]   vasopressin and his son was walking around a grocery store and he, like, was looking
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:54.860]   for him.
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:59.480]   And he turned around and he said he was gobsmacked because his child was, you know, just talking
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.880]   to making chitchat with somebody like in an aisle.
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:05.840]   And he said he had never seen that happen before.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:09.400]   And so, you know, we do have anecdotal reports like that.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:14.960]   And I think, you know, the tricky part is, are we, we didn't stratify anyone going into
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:16.120]   this trial, right?
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:21.280]   And so the concern always is, did we get really lucky in the first trial and we somehow got
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.980]   the, the quote unquote right people that entered the trial that were going to be the ones who
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:27.960]   would respond to the medication?
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:34.200]   Or is this a medication that has sort of broad use in this population and we, you know, the
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.900]   second trial will be positive?
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:44.880]   You used nasal spray to deliver the vasopressin and presumably that gets into the blood circulation
[02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:48.920]   of the brain and supplies neurons with vasopressin.
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:53.100]   But it's very nonspecific and I'm not criticizing it, but if you think about it, you're just
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:54.920]   putting a bunch of vasopressin into the brain.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:59.200]   And if people wonder why this is that it's because basically you have neurons of your
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:02.380]   central nervous system are part of your olfactory system.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:06.880]   And believe it or not, right behind your, where your nose meets your forehead, the brain
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:07.880]   is right there.
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:10.280]   There's a little bit of bone and then the brain is, is right there.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:15.860]   So one of the reasons you can get in there and it's easier than an ocular injection or
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.760]   something that wouldn't be a good approach.
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:22.160]   And it's easier than peripheral injection into the vein.
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.120]   But at the same time, I have to presume that this, I'm imagining this vasopressin just
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:29.760]   kind of like permeating through the brain, binding to whatever receptors happen to be
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:30.760]   there.
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.440]   You said the receptors are everywhere.
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:36.680]   And then this significant improvement in social cognition.
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:42.300]   So that raises all sorts of interesting questions about like what are, what relevant circuits
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:44.180]   are impacted.
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:51.000]   Or is it some global, could it be some global increase in kind of awareness of surroundings?
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.200]   Although some autistic kids are overwhelmed by their awareness of surroundings.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:55.440]   So yeah.
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.320]   What are some thoughts about how vasopressin might be working to exert this, this really
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:02.280]   impressive and frankly important effect?
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.280]   Right.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:04.860]   So, I mean, could it increase social motivation?
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:09.960]   Is it, you know, like, so let's talk about like how sort of complexity of social sensory
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:10.960]   processing.
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:16.340]   Is it that we're directing attention to social cues where there wouldn't have necessarily
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:18.960]   been as much attentiveness, right?
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.420]   Are we increasing social motivation, which would suggest from some of the animal studies
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:25.640]   may actually be happening, right?
[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:26.640]   We don't know.
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:31.440]   And I think that's partly when you have other models or if you're able, you know, to do
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:32.440]   imaging studies.
[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:37.240]   I mean, one thing that's been a little bit of a holy grail in this field is that if we
[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:44.120]   could get tracers that are basically like a, you know, a molecule that would allow us
[02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:48.140]   to inject it into somebody and then visualize the brain, like if I'm thinking about a pet
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:53.740]   trace or a radio ligand, where you could then ask questions about, you know, what's happening
[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:54.740]   in the brain.
[02:23:54.740 --> 02:24:01.300]   Can we, can we give vasopressin in the context of a, you know, functional brain imaging scan
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:03.740]   and ask like, where is the vasopressin binding?
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:05.340]   What kind of circuits are involved?
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:10.560]   Like that needs to be the next step of the work to know like where, where our targets
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.560]   are.
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:13.900]   And you, you can do something like functional proteomics, right?
[02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:19.300]   Where if you know where vasopressin receptors are, you can overlay that with studies of
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:20.920]   functional brain imaging, right?
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:26.080]   And that would allow you to say these areas are dense in vasopressin receptors and do
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:32.040]   we see similar responses in what we call bold signal on a, on a brain scan?
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:34.020]   So let's, let's be more colloquial about this.
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:39.240]   Like do certain areas of the brain light up, if you will, where we know vasopressin receptors
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:47.500]   are, are densely distributed in ways that we know are tied to social motivation or social
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:52.880]   salience or other things that we think could be moving the needle here in the trial?
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.520]   How is this happening?
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:58.460]   And I think, you know, one thing, the reason why we did this work is, and I think it speaks
[02:24:58.460 --> 02:25:05.080]   to what you said earlier is there is an urgency on the part of parents to say, you know, my
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:07.840]   child's brain is developing, right?
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:12.760]   And there's a sense of that, you know, by the sort of Western model has failed a lot
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:13.760]   of people.
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.280]   You know, they look to doctors and say, what are, what are the solutions?
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:20.140]   And doctors will say, well, we have a limited number of tools in the toolkit here.
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:22.040]   We just don't know, right?
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:26.960]   And so, you know, one of the reasons why they did that big oxytocin study was that people
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.200]   were trying to get the oxytocin anyway.
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.120]   So it was like, let's just make sure that this is safe.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:33.740]   Let's see if it's effective.
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:39.920]   And so some of our thinking was, you know, as soon as some of this work hits, you know,
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:42.960]   like it gets in, some of the work has been covered by the media.
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:50.400]   And so, you know, our feeling was we can give this intranasally and we can do it under safe
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.880]   monitoring ways.
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:55.280]   And so people are going to think about doing these things anyway.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.460]   So let's just make sure that this is safe and let's test this in a rigorous way.
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:04.180]   So we don't know the mode of action, but then our feeling is, is that, you know, at least
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:08.440]   from the initial safety data, it looks pretty safe.
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:12.440]   And you know, and so the idea would be, and there's a long tradition in psychiatry of
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:18.520]   we don't know the mechanism of action, but if we have a medication that can be impactful
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:23.840]   and improve the lives of people with autism and we can diminish suffering and people can
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.520]   more readily reach their full potential, you know, to me, it actually seems unethical not
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:33.080]   to move forward in a way that's scientifically sound.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.200]   Amen to that.
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:43.560]   This seems like a good time to raise the topic of the microbiome and not as an unrelated
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:44.560]   topic.
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:51.080]   But I've seen a fair number of studies in mouse models arguing that in a mouse model
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:57.920]   of autism, which now, frankly, I have to kind of wonder about the power of that model.
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.160]   But anyway, the models are out there in the field.
[02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:17.640]   all right.
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:24.340]   That fecal transplant into a host that does have social deficits and rescue some degree
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:25.820]   of social deficits.
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:28.680]   I don't know if this has actually been done in humans as well.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.560]   For those of you that are cringing, yes, they do fecal transplants in humans for treatment
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:35.800]   of obesity and a bunch of other things.
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.680]   This isn't because scientists are obsessed with fecal matter.
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:44.520]   It's because fecal matter contains a lot of the microbiome elements.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.520]   So the microbacteria of the gut.
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:54.200]   And the reason I'm raising this now is, you know, one possibility, and it's not mutually
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:59.520]   exclusive with a brain mechanism, is that the administration of vasopressin somehow
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:02.940]   rescued a vasopressin deficiency in the gut.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.820]   So the questions are as follows.
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:12.060]   Is there any evidence that vasopressin is manufactured in or impacted by the gut microbiome
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:13.200]   of humans?
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:17.920]   We'll just start with humans, since I think most, and because that wouldn't be a smoking
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.520]   gun, but it'd be an interesting detective story.
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:25.540]   Well, okay, so the one piece of evidence that I will say that I find provocative and fascinating,
[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:30.240]   and one thing I want to say is I think there's really great work done in mice.
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:31.640]   I don't want to be a mouse basher.
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:36.600]   So I want to just like sort of go on the record that I'm not bashing other models.
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:40.520]   If it's a conserved, so I think about everything from like an evolutionary perspective.
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:46.140]   If a mouse shares a brain structure with a human and it's highly conserved, you know,
[02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:50.000]   mouse work can be incredibly important and very impactful, right?
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]   Yeah.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.620]   My lab did years of mouse work, some primate work where necessary.
[02:28:54.620 --> 02:29:02.880]   Now I only work on humans, but absolutely it has its uses, but clearly the primate model
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:09.000]   for social deficits as it relates to autism, you at least have me convinced that that one
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000]   has a lot of power.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000]   Let's just say that.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000]   Exactly.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000]   Okay.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.620]   But I'm going to now say there is a really cool mouse study that was done that I found,
[02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:18.980]   and there's been, you know, lots of different studies.
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:23.600]   So there has been mice, so there's these, like I said, these genetically modified mice
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:30.080]   that have genetic syndromes that are, you know, where the individuals have social impairments.
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:34.700]   And some of these individuals, and again, here's a problem with the field.
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:37.140]   Often they will measure oxytocin, but not vasopressin, right?
[02:29:37.140 --> 02:29:41.560]   So like they're not often both measured together, which I always do now.
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:48.920]   But there's been some really interesting evidence that in these mouse models that, and again,
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:55.300]   multiple studies, but like certainly low blood oxytocin levels in these mouse models, and
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:01.400]   with the sense that maybe they have some sort of abnormal gut microbiome.
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.620]   And then what they've done is they've given a probiotic to these mice, normalized their
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:14.440]   social functioning, and there's an increase in oxytocin, and in a recent study also vasopressin,
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:16.620]   at the level of the hypothalamus.
[02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:23.320]   So by giving a probiotic, you, I believe the oxytocin levels were increased in the blood.
[02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:30.200]   You saw more species typical social behavior, and this was all driven by this upregulation
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:35.280]   of oxytocin gene expression, and also vasopressin in this very recent study.
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:41.760]   And what's interesting is there's this nerve called the vagus nerve, which is, it's I think,
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:43.960]   it means the wandering nerve.
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:44.960]   It's for vagabond.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:47.160]   - Yeah, exactly, right.
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:52.740]   And even it's in the gut, but it actually has a direct projection to the nuclei in the
[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:56.020]   hypothalamus where oxytocin and vasopressin are made.
[02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:57.020]   - How interesting.
[02:30:57.020 --> 02:30:58.020]   - Yes.
[02:30:58.020 --> 02:31:03.480]   And so when you sever the vagus, you then in this one study, it's a neuron paper, I
[02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:06.820]   think it's like 2020, it's a super cool paper.
[02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:12.240]   And then what you do is you decrease the gene expression and you don't see the rescue of
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:16.080]   the oxytocin levels or the social behavior in this model.
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:19.440]   - So in other words, if I interpret this correctly, and I'll go look up the paper and provide
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:28.680]   a link to it, there, by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota, 'cause that's really what
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:33.540]   a probiotic does, sort of across the board increases the diversity of gut microbiota.
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:37.920]   No one specific illness, as I always say, 'cause they all seem to end in illness, multiple
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:39.920]   illnesses, illnesses, illnesses.
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:48.520]   - Here we go again, you upregulate gene expression and thereby action of oxytocin and vasopressin
[02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:50.120]   in the hypothalamus.
[02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:52.560]   But that's a neural mediated thing.
[02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:55.240]   It's not as if the microbiota travel to the brain.
[02:31:55.240 --> 02:32:00.000]   Something changes in the gut, which activates the vagal pathway from gut to the specific
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   nucleus in the brain.
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:05.480]   And we know that the vagal pathway is involved because it seems at least partially necessary.
[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:12.120]   If you sever that, you give a vagotomy, then this effect is blunted or eliminated.
[02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:18.680]   That's very interesting and ties the microbiome to oxytocin and vasopressin production in
[02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:27.680]   a neural and somewhat causal way and makes the data on fecal transplants make a lot of
[02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:28.680]   more sense.
[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:32.600]   'Cause I was wondering, okay, so you take the microbiota from one animal, put him into
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:38.520]   another animal, you're transferring the milieu of the gut.
[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:41.280]   But it doesn't say anything about mechanism.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.200]   So this is a really cool paper.
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:44.200]   - It's fascinating.
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:48.600]   And there's also a study I've always wanted to do, is you can get a vagal nerve stimulator.
[02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:52.820]   They used to do them as implants, but you can also get one that you sort of clip onto
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:54.120]   the ear.
[02:32:54.120 --> 02:33:01.520]   And I've always wanted to ask if we use this in autistic individuals, could we increase,
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:04.320]   like can we alter social behavior, right?
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:07.120]   And would that be something that we could actually measure in the blood, especially
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:10.200]   if we're seeing this change in these blood levels, right?
[02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:11.480]   - Are you doing that experiment?
[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:15.560]   - No, but I've always said it would be so cool.
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:17.800]   - We have to get you the funding to do that experiment.
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:20.000]   And I know a few times you've raised the issue of funding.
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.400]   It's not something we spend a lot of time discussing on this podcast, but I think what
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:28.480]   should be abundantly clear to the listeners throughout the course of this episode is,
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:30.880]   as you mentioned earlier, you're very determined to get work done.
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.480]   You'll figure out a way.
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:38.240]   But the way I describe finances and research is that it's absolutely necessary, but it's
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:39.240]   not sufficient.
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:42.680]   You of course have to have the right people and the right lab head directing the work,
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.880]   but no money, no project.
[02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:50.920]   And it is disappointing to see that despite the federal budget for research being still
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:34:00.120]   reasonable, it's not what we would like it to be, it's still very hard for amazing world-class
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:03.880]   labs like yours to say, "Hey, you know, listen, there's this vagal thing and clearly there's
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:04.880]   a rationale.
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:09.020]   It's not like you're pulling this out of nowhere and you want to go to this study."
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:12.240]   But what we're really talking about is three to five years of grant writing before you
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:14.080]   could even initiate that study.
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.960]   Meanwhile, autistic kids are going from age two to five to six.
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.080]   These are critical windows.
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:28.120]   So if ever there was a rationale for moving a lot of funding to, I don't even call it
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:33.520]   high risk, but logically sound hypothesis testing for the treatment of autism, it's
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:34.520]   now.
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:36.440]   So I'm going to get active on this front.
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:43.280]   So I won't get into how, but when I get something in my neural circuits for talking, they tend
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:44.600]   to not shut down for a while.
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.740]   Well, there will be a community that is going to be immensely grateful.
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:52.540]   Well, it seems like the parents of these kids and the kids themselves could greatly benefit.
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:57.860]   So you mentioned that the first study on vasopressin administration that saw these improvements
[02:34:57.860 --> 02:35:02.440]   in social functioning, you said a small cohort, how many kids was it ultimately that you could
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:03.440]   use data from?
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.440]   Okay.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:06.060]   So we had, I mean, you screen a lot.
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:08.980]   So I think our, you know, cause we had very rigid criteria.
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:15.440]   So we ended up with 17 kids that were on active drug and 13 that were on placebo.
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:16.440]   And then-
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.440]   So not a tiny study.
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:23.300]   No, and the placebo, we always have like a humanitarian open label extension arm, which
[02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:27.920]   allows for anybody who is in placebo can get access to the drug.
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:32.320]   So both Antonio and I feel very strongly about making sure that if we're doing a medication
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.200]   trial, everybody can benefit from it.
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:35.200]   Right.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:36.200]   So-
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:38.260]   Afterwards, if they say, okay, I was in the placebo group, but I really want the chance
[02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:39.260]   to try this thing.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:40.260]   Yes.
[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:41.260]   We can, but then you also get more data.
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:42.260]   We get, right.
[02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:46.840]   So I think when the families are now aware that their child is on vasopressin and the
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:51.520]   clinicians are aware, you know, you really want, there's a huge placebo response rate,
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:52.520]   right?
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:58.860]   It's not a placebo response rate here, but we really would want to make sure that our
[02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:04.660]   evaluation of the social behavior is done unaware to the medication, but you can get
[02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:06.200]   good safety data, right?
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:11.000]   So you can have those, you know, 13 children who were on placebo.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:16.860]   We can then also make sure that their blood chemistry labs look good, that their electrocardiograms
[02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:17.860]   look good, right?
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:24.280]   And so that also allows us to assess safety parameters in a greater number of children.
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:30.340]   In a fairly broad literature search, I was able to find, okay, microbiome, so fecal transplant
[02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:32.440]   is something that people are excited about as weird as that.
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:36.160]   And there are trials in people with autism ongoing.
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.160]   Using fecal transplants.
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:38.160]   Yes.
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:39.160]   Okay.
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:44.120]   Oxytocin, nasal spray, presumably still being investigated by some groups or it's been abandoned?
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:49.520]   Well, I think it's mostly been abandoned because there's no funding priorities for it, right?
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:55.100]   So I know that maybe in Australia, because of Adam's positive findings that I don't know
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.660]   what his plans are, but maybe he's doing work there.
[02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:05.000]   There might be a little bit of work with behavioral therapy and oxytocin, but this is the problem
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.680]   when there's one big trial that fails, the funding just completely dries up.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.280]   So even if there's promise, I don't know a single funding agency that's going to touch
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.280]   it.
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:16.320]   Got it.
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:20.120]   And then there's the vasopressin administration work that you're doing.
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:21.120]   Right.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.440]   I think it's worth contrasting that work with the fairly large trial that was done by a
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:32.380]   major pharmaceutical company exploring the role of vasopressin for the treatment of autism.
[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:40.580]   You could tell us what they did because it's basically the opposite of what you did.
[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:46.460]   And you can tell us the outcome because I think that if anything, that study inadvertently
[02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:50.760]   provides support for the results that you observed, which is that administering, let's
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:55.980]   say increasing vasopressin levels in the brain seems to ameliorate some of the social deficits
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:56.980]   of autism.
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:37:57.980]   Right.
[02:37:57.980 --> 02:38:04.720]   So, for example, Roche had a compound called balovaptan, which was a vasopressin V1A receptor
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.840]   antagonist, which basically means there's, I think I mentioned there's these four neuropeptide
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:14.880]   receptors, and oxytocin and vasopressin bind to each other's receptors, but the V1A receptor
[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:21.560]   is the one that is most implicated in social behavior.
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:27.080]   And so they had, and this is the tricky part about when medications are developed in pharma
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:31.600]   versus in academics, in academics, there's definitely this transparency.
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:36.000]   We write grants, the abstracts are publicly available, we register our trials.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.320]   They do too, but a lot of the, shall we say, early development is all put out in publications.
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:46.840]   And then it's also peer reviewed and there's an open trail of why we're doing what we're
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:47.840]   doing.
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.740]   But in a pharmaceutical company, they have the ability because also they have all the
[02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:56.480]   funding to be able to do all kinds of development that may never see the light of day because
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:58.900]   of the proprietary basis of it, right?
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:06.280]   And so when you go back to, so it's not, it still is not clear to me why they took the
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:13.440]   approach of using an antagonist to the main vasopressin receptor in the brain.
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:19.480]   What's interesting is if you go back and you look at the animal literature, there are hamsters
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:22.640]   that if you give them vasopressin, they become aggressive, right?
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.780]   And if you give male prairie voles vasopressin, they can become aggressive.
[02:39:26.780 --> 02:39:29.920]   But let's think about the context that they're doing this in.
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.420]   These hamsters that show aggression are asocial.
[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:34.740]   They live by themselves.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:40.900]   If you give them vasopressin and the only social repertoire they have is to have sex
[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:45.880]   with a female or to fight a male that they see, they have a very limited social repertoire,
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:46.880]   right?
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:53.080]   So if a prairie vole male is being given vasopressin, it's often in the context of like protecting
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:54.960]   his mate and his offspring.
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:59.760]   And so then it's actually species appropriate for him to attack a maraudering male on his
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:03.380]   territory who's going to, you know, kill his babies, right?
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:08.800]   And so my thinking in reading the preclinical literature, the animal literature, was that,
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:13.620]   all right, that makes a lot of sense in the context of those species, but we've never
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:16.320]   seen any evidence in our trial.
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:17.320]   Vazopressin didn't change.
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:20.760]   We also have an aggression measure in the current trial as well.
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:26.680]   But, you know, for me, the vast majority of evidence from the animal literature suggested
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:34.400]   that vasopressin was prosocial and that, you know, especially given our CSF findings, like
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:40.400]   over and over, across species, across studies, across ages, that we should be giving vasopressin,
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:46.360]   especially given the correlations between vasopressin in CSF and symptom severity and
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.960]   autistic traits, you know, the former in people and the latter in the monkeys.
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:58.120]   And so they had some preliminary studies that I believe were maybe single dose, one that
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:04.080]   they published, but then they had a trial where the primary outcome measure, the social
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:09.820]   responsiveness scale, was negative, and then they had some secondary measures that maybe
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:16.260]   showed some promise, and then they were conducting another trial, and then they did a futility
[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:20.280]   analysis and I know they stopped the trial, and I don't think it was for safety reasons,
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:24.540]   but again, you know, a lot of this isn't made public, right, because it's a pharmaceutical
[02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:25.540]   company.
[02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:30.800]   So, you know, we will see, because we are going to be completing our larger trial, you
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.240]   know, this year, and, you know, as they say, the proof is in the pudding, so we will see
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:37.720]   if, you know, we can replicate our initial pilot findings.
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:42.380]   Well, it sounds like they got it backwards, that blocking vasopressin pathways would just
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:49.180]   make things worse, and that augmenting vasopressin makes things better, although that last statement
[02:41:49.180 --> 02:41:52.180]   needs to be supported by this more extensive population.
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:53.180]   Right.
[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:55.740]   Well, I think, you know, there's been a lot of speculation and maybe there are people
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:42:00.320]   closer to the trial than me who might be able to speak to mechanism, but, you know, I would
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:04.380]   meet the Roche people at conferences and they would come to my talks and I would always
[02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:08.540]   ask them, like, "What's the mechanism of action, why are you antagonizing the system when we're
[02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:11.840]   giving, you know, a vasopressin agonist, if you will?"
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.340]   And you know, some people had said, "Well, maybe by blocking the vasopressin receptor,
[02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:21.380]   you know, there's a way to have oxytocin be more bioavailable."
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:22.740]   That sounds like some gymnastics to me.
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:23.900]   Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:31.100]   And so I've never had a, I've never received a compelling response from anybody about why
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:34.700]   they did their trial and then, you know, the differences.
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:41.320]   I mean, when this was ongoing and, you know, there was potentially room for both, right,
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:45.260]   you know, maybe I thought that maybe there's some optimal band of vasopressin signaling
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:46.640]   in the brain, right?
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:51.100]   And so maybe there's some people where they have too much vasopressin and some who have
[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:52.100]   too little, right?
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:57.160]   And so this was a lot of maybes, but it doesn't to me seem like that's the case, especially
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:00.800]   if our current trial has a positive readout.
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:09.660]   I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for your stance and read of the landscape on the data about
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:10.660]   vaccines and autism.
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:13.800]   I'm not talking about COVID vaccines here, I want to be really clear about that.
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:21.020]   But there was a theory running about, not just in the press, but in the scientific literature
[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:26.040]   for a while, that vaccines could cause autism.
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:28.720]   That was proposed.
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:31.960]   My understanding is that was debunked.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.740]   That idea still lives on the internet.
[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:41.600]   But what is the evidence or let's say, let's go through this sequentially.
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:43.460]   What was the idea?
[02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:45.340]   What was the evidence for that idea?
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:51.780]   And then what caused the demise of the, at least the scientific support for that idea?
[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:57.040]   Leaving open, of course, that new data may come, but let's talk about what is known now.
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:58.040]   Right.
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:05.260]   So what I will say is being evidence-based is something that all scientists should strive
[02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:06.260]   for.
[02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:07.260]   Right?
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:10.680]   And so the backstory on this is there was a guy named Andrew Wakefield who published
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:16.580]   a paper and he basically said the preservatives and vaccines are causing autism.
[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:21.380]   So not the specific vaccine, but the adjuvant, the stuff that's preserving, the stuff that's
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:24.220]   keeping the vaccines bio-effective.
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.500]   Right.
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:27.060]   At least that was my understanding.
[02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:28.060]   Yeah.
[02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:29.060]   That's mine as well.
[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:33.320]   And so, and then it turns, I want to be clear because the internet is a, is a, is a cruel
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.700]   and diabolical place.
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:38.720]   My stance is that that was the hypothesis.
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:40.920]   I don't agree with that stance.
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:41.920]   Right.
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:42.920]   Okay.
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:43.920]   Right.
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:47.800]   And so, or if we want to just back up a little bit broader, there was this idea that something
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:52.480]   about vaccines were causing autism, but the study was debunked.
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:56.200]   He lost his medical license and the paper was retracted, right?
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:59.820]   He lost his medical license on the basis of the fact that the study was wrong.
[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:00.820]   Or was there ever-
[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:01.820]   I think he faked the data.
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:05.980]   There were, that's what I recall as well, that there was evidence of him literally making
[02:45:05.980 --> 02:45:06.980]   up the data.
[02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:07.980]   Right.
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:08.980]   Right.
[02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:09.980]   So it wasn't a case of like sloppy technique.
[02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:12.860]   It was a case of intentional fraud.
[02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:13.860]   Right.
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:14.860]   That's my understanding.
[02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:15.860]   Again-
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.820]   What was his, does anyone ever like look into what his motivation for what it was?
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:22.540]   Like why someone would, I mean, he threw away his whole career.
[02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:23.540]   Right.
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:24.540]   Yeah.
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:25.540]   I don't, I don't know.
[02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:26.540]   I don't know.
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:31.840]   But I think the hard part about that is understandably, people got very frightened, right?
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:38.200]   That we're doing something to our children that could have unanticipated consequences.
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:43.640]   And when something like that happens, then we dump, we spend a lot of money investigating
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:44.640]   it.
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:48.520]   And so the good news is at this point, there have been multiple, multiple studies that
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.980]   haven't shown a correlation between vaccines and autism.
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:56.980]   I do believe that preservatives have been changed as a result.
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:00.960]   So that's something we should check that, you know, that might be something where, you
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:04.760]   know, there's been a public health change on preservatives that are in vaccines.
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:06.240]   That's interesting in its own right.
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:08.240]   I mean, we don't want to cause alarm.
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:12.600]   But that's, that's interesting, you know, that, that in this data fraud case, it might
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:18.140]   have cued people to the idea that certain things might have been needing change, even
[02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:23.100]   though it wasn't the specific issue that this, this fraudulent researcher was focused on.
[02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:26.320]   The change was made to make sure people would vaccinate their children, right?
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:30.320]   Like, so this is something that I think we should have lots of caveats here, like, you
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:35.240]   know, post the, post the studies, like make sure that what we're saying is accurate, right?
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:40.240]   But I, but I think that my concern is that we've spent, you know, so the good news is
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:46.600]   that, you know, the, like every single study that I'm aware of does not show a relationship
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:48.960]   between vaccination and autism, right?
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:53.660]   And so I think that most scientists and medical doctors that I know that are part of like
[02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:59.620]   the, you know, standard biomedical research community do not believe that vaccines cause
[02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:00.620]   autism.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:02.540]   They vaccinate their own children.
[02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:06.980]   You know, they recommend vaccinations to other people's children.
[02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:10.120]   And so I think that's where we are, you know.
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:12.680]   Could I just ask a question?
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:16.860]   And I feel more than obligated to do this because I don't, you know, I think I have
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:20.940]   a pretty good finger on the pulse of the listenership of this podcast, but I think there's a range
[02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:28.120]   of, of stances on this where some people have a lot of trust in the standard medical establishment,
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:31.280]   others have less trust in the standard medical establishment.
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:37.600]   And I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try and represent all those sides.
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:43.240]   And you know, one thing that I've heard is that over the last 20 or 30 years, there's
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.180]   been a dramatic increase in the number of vaccinations that kids get.
[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:51.420]   And I don't know if that's true, but when we say vaccinations, we could be talking about,
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:55.560]   you know, measles, mumps, rubella, polio.
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:01.420]   We could also be talking about measles, mumps, rubella, polio, flu shots every year, rabies
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:05.040]   vaccine, tetanus vaccine, you know, HPV, right?
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:09.560]   With one that wasn't even available when I was in college, you know, as everyone in college
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:14.580]   was well aware, there wasn't an HPV vaccine, didn't change people's behavior a whole lot.
[02:48:14.580 --> 02:48:23.240]   But you know, there's, there's a vaccine, there's multiple vaccines, and then there's,
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:25.200]   you know, all the vaccines, right?
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:30.560]   And I think that one of the concerns that I hear about is the idea that, okay, there's
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:35.640]   some critical vaccines, but then which ones are perhaps less critical, if any.
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:40.800]   And these are the kinds of discussions that are starting to surface, and that, you know,
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:45.160]   have parents and potential parents, you know, rightfully thinking about this stuff.
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:47.320]   And no one really knows where to get the information.
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:54.380]   But like, I've tried, and I can't find a pediatrician that says, hey, listen, these, but not those,
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:59.540]   or you can certainly find board certified physicians that say many, and certain board
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:02.880]   certified physicians that say none, you actually can find those.
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.120]   The none category tend to hide themselves a little bit more than others for obvious reasons.
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.680]   But it's hard to get a sense of like, which, which vaccines are critical and which ones
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:15.080]   aren't, if you're a parent, and you're not versed in this stuff.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:20.460]   And so you could imagine that like, people are, you know, kids are taking many more vaccines,
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:23.340]   and only some of those are critical, and maybe all of them are critical.
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:28.280]   I think, I guess the way I would maybe turn it on its head is that, you know, because
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:37.080]   of this, this study that did, in some ways, so much harm, right, like we spent, we spent,
[02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:42.760]   I don't even want to hazard a guess about how much money worldwide went into studying,
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.700]   you know, the, you know, vaccines and autism based on a fraudulent data, right?
[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:49.520]   Like that's, to me, a real tragedy.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.280]   But at the time, they didn't know it was fraudulent.
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:52.280]   No, right.
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:53.280]   Exactly.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:54.280]   So they went after this thinking it was true.
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:55.280]   Okay.
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:50:00.400]   So I think, I think the thing, the consequence of all this that I think is also extremely
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:10.280]   sad is that everybody, because everyone got so riled up and so fearful, there has been,
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:14.500]   historically until recently, many researchers who are like, oh, man, I don't want to touch
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:17.720]   immunology and autism with a 10-foot pole, right?
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:19.040]   And yeah.
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.240]   You know, and I wouldn't consider myself fearless, but like my lab never had any reason to work
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:26.040]   on those, on those important problems.
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:28.840]   But I'll tell you, like, yeah, it seems like it's not a kettle of fish.
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:33.080]   It's a ball of barbed wire with a bunch of, you know, napalm burning around it.
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:36.560]   You know, I mean, you say one thing, your career is ending.
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:39.120]   You say the opposite thing, your career is also ending.
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:42.840]   You know, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a mess.
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.520]   But, but I think this highlights that there are so many parents, you know, again, and
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:50.400]   I think we need to listen to parents' stakeholders, right?
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:55.320]   Like, you know, there's, there needs to be a dialogue whenever anybody's studying any
[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:59.400]   illness to, to talk to the people who are involved, right?
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:03.840]   And, and I think that there are parents who will report, wow, like there are, there is
[02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:07.280]   immune system dysregulation in my child.
[02:51:07.280 --> 02:51:14.080]   And, but because of this historical issue with vaccines, it's only been very recently
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:19.640]   that I think people, scientists, medical doctors have said, okay, we're hearing a lot about
[02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:21.400]   this from parents.
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:27.520]   And are there a group of individuals who have, you know, immune issues that could be driving
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:28.520]   their autism, right?
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:31.040]   We don't know and everything should be evidence based.
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:35.800]   But I think that, like you said, with this cancel culture and all this fear, scientists
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:41.700]   sometimes will pick topics very judiciously based on, you know, like, hey, I just want
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:45.520]   to be left in peace and I'm trying to help this community.
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:49.760]   And if there is areas of the enterprise that you think are going to cause all kinds of
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:54.840]   grief, then people are going to be less reluctant to study them, even if it's critically needed.
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:52:00.320]   Well, that's a perfect place to say thank you.
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:05.920]   I realize you're not addressing the vaccine autism issue directly, but you're so clearly
[02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:10.960]   going after the target, trying to figure out what are the biological mechanisms that are
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:17.780]   disrupted in autism and by extension, other deficits of social function in kids and adults.
[02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:24.560]   You've identified this incredible relationship between vasopressin, which should have more
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:32.480]   prominence in my opinion than oxytocin, its lesser cousin, just kidding, oxytocin lovers.
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.360]   But also have shown, you know, yes, in a small study, but you're now extending this to a
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:44.140]   larger cohort, as you mentioned, a causal relationship when vasopressin is administered
[02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:49.720]   to these low vasopressin/low social functioning kids, their symptoms improve.
[02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:56.880]   So I know I speak for many people when I say that I truly appreciate your doggedness in
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:53:01.680]   going after this problem, especially on the complicated landscape of lack of funding for
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:09.980]   doing novel and truly high-risk work, especially on the backdrop of the sociopolitical landscape
[02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:10.980]   around autism.
[02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:14.600]   It's a complicated thing even to discuss, you know, as I mentioned in the introduction,
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:19.320]   you know, we had to have some fluency around autism, so we sometimes said autistic.
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:23.760]   Sometimes we said people with autism, you know, I mean, it's a tough one, but in order
[02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:27.840]   to make progress, real progress in this area, we need people like you.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:32.200]   We need you and you're doing it to get in there and just go, okay, you know, let's get
[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:33.700]   at the biological functions.
[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:37.040]   Let's get at the novel treatments and you're making amazing progress.
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:41.200]   So I'm so grateful that you're doing it and that you'll continue to do it and that you
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:44.960]   came here today to teach us what you've been up to.
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:49.720]   I'm also grateful and I just want to say thank you for that and that we absolutely have to
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:55.340]   get you back here to give us an update on your progress really soon and again and again
[02:53:55.340 --> 02:53:56.340]   and again.
[02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:57.340]   Thank you so much.
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:58.340]   I love being here.
[02:53:58.340 --> 02:53:59.340]   All right.
[02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:04.420]   Well, I've loved this conversation and I'll sign off by saying, folks, this is how diseases
[02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:06.380]   are cured.
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:10.040]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Karen Parker about the biological
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:12.720]   basis of social functioning and autism.

[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:47.780]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:51.920]   Not so much on today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:53.520]   we discuss supplements.
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:57.380]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:01.860]   them for things like improving sleep, for hormone support, and for improving focus.
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:06.280]   To learn more about the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, go to Live Momentous,
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.640]   spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:15.900]   If you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman Lab on Instagram, X,
[02:55:15.900 --> 02:55:19.160]   formerly called Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:23.420]   And at all of those places, I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:27.160]   with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:28.720]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.400]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.320]   If you haven't already subscribed to our neural network newsletter, our neural network newsletter
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:39.380]   is a zero cost newsletter that comes out every month.
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:44.200]   It includes podcast summaries, as well as protocols in the form of short PDFs of maybe
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:49.280]   just one to three pages, where I list out the specific protocols, for instance, for
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:54.720]   improving dopamine functioning, or for improving your sleep, or for deliberate cold exposure,
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.860]   deliberate heat exposure, or fitness protocols, and on and on, all of which are presented
[02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:05.140]   in brief fashion, very direct, just the protocols listed out, again, completely zero cost.
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:10.540]   To sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu function, scroll down to newsletter,

[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:15.220]   And I should point out that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:19.060]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with Dr. Karen Parker.
[02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:22.140]   And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
