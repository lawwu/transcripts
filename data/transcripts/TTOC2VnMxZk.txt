[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   We come back once more to a consideration of the great prayer that the Apostle Paul
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.740]   was offering for the members of the Church at Ephesus, which is to be found in his epistle
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:20.260]   to the Ephesians in the third chapter. Again I would read from verse 14 to the end of the
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.260]   chapter. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.300]   the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.340]   riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner men, that
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.180]   Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.020]   may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.300]   height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.860]   with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.140]   all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.260]   in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.300]   We are considering this great prayer, this great petition that the apostle offers for
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.780]   these people, and we have arrived at the petition that is found in the seventeenth verse, that
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:48.420]   Christ may dwell in your hearts by or through faith, that ye, being rooted, that ye, having
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:59.060]   been rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints the greatness
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.600]   of the love of Christ.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.780]   Now we are here, as I keep on saying Sunday by Sunday, in the very holiest of all, as
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:21.140]   it were, of the Christian life and the Christian message. And for that very reason, we need
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.180]   to pray for ourselves, as the apostle prayed for these Ephesians, that they might be strengthened
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:37.300]   with all might by his Spirit in the inner man. It would be foolish, it would be idle,
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.100]   to pretend or to assume that this great prayer is something which is easy to understand or
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.780]   easy to expound, of necessity. It isn't, and it cannot be, and it is not meant to be.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.140]   The Christian faith, the Christian message, the Christian gospel is wonderful and marvelous.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.540]   It can be compared to a great ocean. A little child can pedal at the edge of the ocean,
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.740]   but the way out in the center, in the depths, the mightiest Atlantic liner is but like a
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.580]   cork or a bubble. There is no end to it, as it were. But it is the same thing, it is the
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.100]   same ocean. And thus, you see, we come into the Christian life and we enter it as children.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.700]   We just begin to pedal, but we must go on and out into the depths, and that is what
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.780]   we are led to do as we consider this great prayer together.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.740]   And that is why I come back again to this seventeenth verse. You can't just make a
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.580]   few comments upon these mighty phrases and then pass on, feeling that you've dealt
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.900]   with it and you can go on to something else. These phrases are all of them so full of matter.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.420]   They come to us with such a wealth and they search us in such a manner that it is our
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.660]   business and our duty to pause and to ponder them deeply and to spend much time with them.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.460]   Because when you are dealing with great and profound truth, it is always something that
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.620]   is liable to misunderstanding also. But the thing above everything else that I am anxious
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.220]   to impress upon you this morning is this. Handling a matter like this, we are incapable
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.060]   of a precision which we can manifest when we are dealing with the beginnings of the
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.860]   Christian faith. There should be no difficulty about stating the doctrine of justification
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.060]   by faith clearly. And the men who cannot do that should never stand in a pulpit with a
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.300]   doubt. In the beginnings of the Christian life there is exactitude, precision, perfectly
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.660]   clear. But when you come on to a realm like this, well, I say, we mustn't expect to
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.500]   be so precise. You can't put things into categories in exactly the same way as you
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.660]   did at the beginning. The very nature and the character of the truth makes that quite
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.460]   impossible. So if you find yourselves up to a point, as I've no doubt many do and many
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.780]   did last Sunday morning and on previous occasions when we've looked at this, without having
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   that exact ability to understand, don't be surprised. There is a sense in which there
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:39.340]   is something almost good in that. You can't dissect an aroma. You can't analyze love,
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.160]   in a sense. And that's the very thing with which we are dealing here. We can but go forward
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.420]   and go as far as we can in our attempt to bring out the truth in its richness and to
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.980]   elucidate as far as that is possible. But we do it, I say, with fear and trembling.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:05.500]   I am ready to confess very freely that I do not recall in thirty years having dealt with
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:14.200]   anything in the Scripture where I have been so conscious of my own inadequacy and inability
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:21.980]   as with this particular passage. I don't stand here to make authoritative statements,
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.760]   but I am here by the grace of God, and it's a tremendous privilege just to hold these
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.260]   things before you and to beseech you in a spirit of humility to look at them and to
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:40.060]   ponder them and to pray about them. Not in an argumentative spirit, I say, not with a
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.220]   desire to have everything exactly labeled. You can't do that here. But with a desire
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.700]   to enter in to this place where, coming face to face with God and the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:02.940]   through the Holy Spirit, perhaps one shall find oneself just speechless because of the
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.300]   glory with which we are confronted.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.540]   Well now then, I say that there are two big things which we must bear in mind once more.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.620]   The first is that this petition is offered for those who are already believers. This
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.660]   is not a petition for unbelievers. It is a petition offered for those who are already
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:32.180]   members of the Church in the Christian faith. Now, that is something we've got to emphasize
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:41.620]   for this reason, that this passage alone shows this very clearly, that any Christian who
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:49.340]   is satisfied with his or her position or experience is in a very sad and deplorable condition.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.300]   It's something that can happen to us very easily, and especially at a time like this,
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:01.780]   with so much error and so much heresy, so much apostasy, with so much false understanding
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.660]   of the elements of the Christian faith. It's a very simple thing for those who are evangelical
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.300]   to imagine that they've arrived, and because they're always contrasting themselves with
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.620]   those who are obviously wrong, to think that they need nothing more. My dear friend, what
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.380]   you need to do is not to look at people who are wrong, but to look at the saints. Look
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:27.300]   at a passage like this, and measure yourself by this. This is the thing the Apostle wants
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:35.660]   believers to go on to. Very well, then, I say, we must realize that we have not received
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.660]   all, and our business is not merely to maintain the position at which we've arrived. We must
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:46.200]   press on unto perfection. We must forget the things that are behind, and press onwards
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.780]   toward the mark, the high calling, the prize that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.280]   But having emphasized that side, let me emphasize this other side. And this is one of the most
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:06.700]   marvelous things of all. The Apostle offers this prayer for all Christians. It isn't
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.900]   merely a prayer for certain exceptional people. The New Testament, unlike the Roman Catholic
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:21.740]   Church or other forms of Catholicism, does not divide believers into religious and laity.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:27.620]   It's an utterly false distinction, then. There are no specialists in the Christian life.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.080]   This prayer is offered for all. The Apostle was there himself. Yes, but he wants all these
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.340]   Ephesians to get there. And when you read something about these people, it becomes still
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.740]   more wonderful. They'd come out of paganism. And it's very easy to discover from this epistle
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.980]   alone the kind of people they once were, the kind of life they used to live. He has to
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.380]   remind them that they mustn't go on stealing, they mustn't go on committing adultery,
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.820]   they mustn't go on talking foolishly and having their own worthy jests and jokes, they
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.380]   mustn't go on being liars. Well, that's the type of life they had been living. We
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:13.260]   know the state of the world at that time. We know something about paganism at all times.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:19.660]   The darkness and the sin and the squalor, well, they'd come out of all that. And here
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.980]   you see, though they'd only just come out of that, the great Apostle holds before them
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:34.180]   this tremendous possibility. And it is because it is possible for them that he thus prays
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:40.300]   for them. And we must remind ourselves this morning, therefore, that it is very wrong
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.820]   and very sinful to say, "Oh, that's not for me. That's for some exceptional people."
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:52.300]   No, it is for you. It is for all Christians. It is for all believers. And we must never
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.500]   be satisfied for a moment until we are in this position and know it experimentally and
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.260]   are able to rejoice in it. I imagine that there will be nothing more terrible at the
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:12.500]   day of judgment when we shall see our Lord face to face than to realize what was possible
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:20.140]   for us in this life. And yet to know that we never bothered ourselves about it, we skimmed
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.340]   over these great phrases without ever delving into them and trying to discover what they
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.740]   meant and whether we might have that, I can imagine nothing more terrible than that possibility.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.140]   Very well, then, let me come back and try once more to give a little further definition
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:47.740]   as to what this means, this Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith. What does it mean?
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:55.020]   Let us try to expand it or explain it a little further. Now, let me take up this point. What
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:02.220]   is the relationship of this to the sealing of the Spirit? Some people seem to think that
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:08.500]   this is identical with the sealing of the Spirit, but obviously that cannot be the case.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.140]   The apostle has already reminded these Ephesians in the thirteenth verse of the first chapter
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:20.500]   that they have already been sealed with the Spirit, in whom he also trusted after that
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:26.340]   he heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that he
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:35.500]   believed or having believed, he were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. He is offering
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.420]   this petition that Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith for people who had already
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:52.140]   been sealed with or by the Spirit. Therefore, these two things are patently not identical,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.420]   and it is very difficult to understand how anyone could ever have imagined for a moment
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.900]   that they could mean the same thing. And yet I think I can understand where the confusion
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:12.740]   comes in. As I was saying just now, in this realm it is very difficult to catalogue things
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:19.420]   and to put your labels upon them as distinct and separate things for this reason, that
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:25.940]   every experience, and especially every high experience in the Christian life, is of necessity
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:32.940]   related to the Holy Spirit and to the Lord Jesus Christ. As I had to say last Sunday
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.580]   morning, you cannot be a Christian at all unless Christ is in you. Well, then you say
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.540]   if Christ is in you, what does he mean by praying that Christ may dwell in their hearts?
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:47.580]   Well, we answered the question. It is a kind of settling, a settling down, if you like,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.900]   in the life, in a deeper and in a more settled manner than hitherto. But you see, there seems
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.820]   to be a confusion even there. That is because of the inadequacy of language. That is because
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.940]   of the glorious nature of the truth. And it is the same with the Holy Spirit. If any man
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.140]   is not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And yet that is a very different thing
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:16.220]   from being baptized by the Spirit or being sealed by the Spirit, as we have seen. So
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.460]   that here, you see, as we come back again, we are using the same terms in a sense. We
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.260]   are still talking about the Lord Jesus Christ. We are talking about the Holy Spirit. And
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:33.100]   yet there is a difference. They have been sealed, and yet he prays that this may be
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.540]   their portion. What then is the difference between this and the sealing of the Spirit?
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:43.740]   Well, I would say it is mainly this, that the sealing with the Holy Spirit is primarily
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:51.020]   a matter of assurance of salvation. The sealing of the Spirit is that which gives us that
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:57.460]   direct and immediate assurance that we are the children of God and the heirs of God and
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:03.940]   that the inheritance is going to be ours. Now, this which we are dealing with here is
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:13.540]   not primarily a matter of assurance. It is mainly a question of communion with the Lord.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:20.660]   The sealing assures me that I am related to him, that I belong to him. This is now that
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:27.700]   which brings me the fellowship and the communion with him in a deeper and in a greater sense.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.780]   I would say that that is the essential difference between the sealing with the Spirit and this.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.860]   Obviously, they are both great experiences. And as we saw, when you are sealed with the
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.300]   Spirit, you have a consciousness of Christ, of course. You are aware of the power of the
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.180]   Spirit, of necessity. But here, I say, is something which goes beyond that and is deeper.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:55.980]   Let me put it then secondly like this. This experience is more permanent than that of
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:05.020]   sealing. Sealing is something which can be often repeated. It is repeated in the lives
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:11.900]   of the saints. You see repetitions of it in the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Here
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:19.140]   is something which is more permanent. This very word dwell emphasizes that settling down,
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:25.860]   taking up your abode. So there is another element. Do not press it too far, but it is
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.420]   a real distinction. There is a greater element of permanence here. Furthermore, I would add
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:39.980]   this, that I would say that in this experience there is less of what you may call the ecstatic
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.660]   element than in the sealing. In connection with the sealing, what one is conscious of
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:56.780]   is this glory, this immediacy, this luminosity. Whereas here, it is something on a deeper
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:06.060]   level, more permanent, and therefore less ecstatic. If I may put it in a little illustration,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:18.220]   I remember hearing what an old preacher said during a revival in Wales in 1904 and 5. In
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:26.580]   this revival, large numbers of people were suddenly experiencing the baptism of the Spirit,
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:34.980]   and often accompanied by great ecstasy and great joy and much praising. Some of these
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:41.140]   younger people were rather surprised that this old minister, who had been in a similar
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:51.100]   revival in 1859, when he was a young man, expressed the surprise that the old minister
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.260]   did not seem to be having the ecstatic joy that they were having. They could not understand
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.780]   this. They felt there was something wrong with him, and they went and talked to him
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:08.580]   about it. What he said to them was something like this, and I would apply it to these matters.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:16.180]   He said, "You know, it is the difference between falling in love for the first time
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:22.500]   and living with your wife in a state of love throughout the years. That first ecstatic
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.860]   excitement does not continue, but it does not mean there is less love. There is less
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:32.580]   excitement about it. There is less fuss and bother, if I may so put it. But it does not
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:38.540]   mean that there is any diminution in the love. It may well mean the exact opposite, that
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:44.460]   it is a deeper love. Well, now, it is something of the same here. With this difference, it
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:51.180]   seems to me, between the sealing with the Spirit and this Christ dwelling in the heart.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.260]   This is a greater love, it is a greater knowledge, it is a greater intimacy, it is a greater
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:02.780]   fellowship. Yes, but it has not just that thrill, if you like, that the first experience
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.980]   of the power of the Spirit invariably brings. Well, let us leave it like that.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.580]   Let me go on and deal with a second matter. I come back again to attempt to describe still
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:22.060]   more the nature and the character of this experience, this knowledge of Christ dwelling
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:28.900]   in the heart by faith. Let me put it like this. It is the difference between knowing
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:36.720]   Christ for you and knowing Christ in you. Now, in the beginning of the Christian faith,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:43.220]   we of necessity have to concentrate on Christ for us. The beginning of the Christian life
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:49.620]   should always be mainly objective. In other words, what makes us Christian is that we
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.060]   realize certain things about the Lord Jesus Christ, his work for us, and his relationship
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:03.260]   to us. Now, that is objective. We look at Christ outside us. We look at him coming and
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.420]   being born as a baby in Bethlehem. We watch him growing up. We listen to his teaching.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.220]   We observe his miracles. We see him dying on the cross. And we look at that and we say,
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.460]   "Now, what is happening there? Why did he go there? What is he doing there?" And we
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:24.540]   say, "He is there bearing my sins. He is dying for my sins. Christ for me. I am standing
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:33.700]   outside and I am looking at him and what he has done for me and on my behalf." Objective.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:41.020]   Now then, this is not objective. This is something that results from the objective. This is subjective.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.780]   "Ah, but someone says, 'But surely there is a subjective element in the other.'" Of
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:50.140]   course there is. As I am saying, you must not draw these distinctions too sharply. If
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.900]   there is not a subjective element there, you are not a Christian at all. It may be pure
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:02.180]   theory in your mind. Yes, but speaking broadly, that is mainly objective. This is mainly subjective.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.540]   The objective element still remains here, but it is not a big thing. We have now gone
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:12.580]   on to this other position in which we are mainly concerned about Christ not as the one
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:20.580]   who died for me, but Christ as my life. Christ is the one who resides within me and who takes
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.780]   up his abode within my life and within my consciousness.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.300]   Now let me give you one statement of this which was spoken by the Lord himself, which
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.780]   I think will help us to understand this. You will find it in the sixth chapter of the Gospel
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:43.780]   according to St. John. He puts it like this. Verse 53 and following, "Verily, verily, I
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.420]   say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:56.500]   life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.420]   him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. Now listen to this. As
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:21.340]   the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:30.180]   he shall live by me." Now, that is a very profound saying and one which is difficult
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   to understand. We read later on, "Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:43.220]   This is an hard saying. Who can hear it?" And indeed the passage goes on to say that
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.820]   many of them went back and walked no more with him. They said, "No, we cannot follow
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.700]   this sort of thing. This has gone beyond our depths. We cannot be bothered with this."
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:56.060]   And they left him. Many would have been following him. You see, we are in a realm where it is
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:02.820]   very difficult to understand these things. So let me use a phrase like this. "What
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:11.540]   is this?" Well, I say, "It is Christ dwelling within." Not as an influence, not as a memory,
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:18.780]   not merely through his teaching, not merely through the Holy Spirit. It is Christ himself
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:27.300]   dwelling within us. Let me use the term. It is a mystical relationship. I have got to
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:35.100]   use the term because nothing else and nothing less does justice to the teaching of the New
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.460]   Testament concerning this matter. Take that passage I have just read to you. Take again
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.700]   those statements in the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John, which
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:51.300]   we read last Sunday, where Christ said that he will manifest himself to them, where he
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.900]   says that he will come and take up his abode within them, that he and the Father will take
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:01.820]   up their abode. And you get the same thing in the seventeenth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.700]   You get it in the writings of this apostle, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Not
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.500]   Christ among you, Christ in you, the hope of glory. "I live yet not I, but Christ
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:22.580]   liveth in me." All these statements. Now, they are terms which describe this mystical
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.860]   relationship. I put it like that for this reason. Somebody may come to me and say, "Well,
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:33.060]   now, how do you mean that Christ dwells in me? I can't understand it." My dear friend,
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:39.260]   of course you can't. I don't understand it. Nobody can understand it. It is Scripture.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.780]   It is a mystical something that is beyond understanding. Our bodies, we are told, are
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:50.060]   the temples of the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. The Holy Ghost is in heaven, yes, but
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:57.620]   he is in me. And the Lord Jesus Christ is in heaven, but he is also in me. It is a mystical
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:04.980]   relationship and we mustn't minimize it. We mustn't scale it down. We must give it
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.140]   its full weight. Now, I say that we are bound to do that because otherwise we don't do
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:18.380]   justice to the Scriptures. But you know, we not only do not do justice to the Scriptures,
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.300]   we don't do justice to the great experiences that the saints of God have had throughout
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:31.580]   the centuries. Take that hymn which we have just been singing, "Jesus, thou joy of loving
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:44.620]   hearts." Is he that to you? "Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts." Is that true of you?
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.980]   You see, you can believe on his work for you, you can be a Christian, you can be saved by
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:57.500]   him without being able to say quite honestly that he is the joy of your heart. Now, when
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   these people wrote these hymns, they meant what they said. They were being honest. They
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:09.180]   were relating their experiences. It isn't mere poetry. "Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts,
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:18.380]   thou fount of life, thou light of men. From the best bliss that earth imparts, we turn
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:26.860]   unfilled to thee again." Is it true of us? Let me give you some more. Take another one,
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:38.020]   "Jesus, the very thought of thee, with sweetness fills the breast." Is it true? Can you really
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:45.300]   say that? Now, my argument is that these men are writing their experience here. It isn't
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:51.740]   theory. They had read these Scriptures, they had realized their application to them, they
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:58.220]   had sought this, and they had obtained. And this is how they write as a result of it.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.620]   But listen to this great hymn. I am reading hymn number 173 in this hymnary. Let me read
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:12.460]   you verse 4. Verse 3 first, "O hope of every contrite heart, O joy of all the meek. To
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:20.740]   those who fall, how kind thou art. How good to those who seek." But listen, "But what
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:32.220]   to those who find, ah, this, nor tongue nor pen can show." I want to confess to you that
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:38.260]   that line was a great comfort to me during this past week. As I struggled with all this,
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:44.220]   how can I say it? How can I express it? How can I make it clear? I like to be logical,
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.860]   I like to be plain, I like to be consecutive. But how can I do that with this? Here's the
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:57.220]   answer, "But what to those who find, ah, this, nor tongue nor pen can show." The love
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:05.300]   of Jesus, what it is, none but his loved ones know, but they do know. They can't tell you
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.260]   much about it in an exact manner, they can't be scientific about it, but they know it,
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:16.620]   they're rejoicing in it. None but his loved ones know, but they do know. And then let
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:28.540]   me go on, "O Jesus, King most wonderful, thou conqueror renowned, thou sweetness most
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:40.300]   ineffable, in whom all joys are found." You know, there's a great deal to be said for
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:50.260]   the people who hold the view that we shouldn't sing hymns in public. We can often be very
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:57.640]   dishonest, can't we, as we sing hymns. We've often sung this hymn. But is it true of us?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:04.580]   We claim to be singing experience. "Thou sweetness most ineffable, in whom all joys
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:12.340]   are found." Is that true of you? Have you found that? These men have found it. That's
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.660]   why they sing this. They're not dishonest, they're relating their experience. Then he
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:25.700]   goes on, "When once thou visitest the heart, then truth begins to shine." That's a different
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.900]   thing from an intellectual apprehension of it. Have you known this luminosity, this shining
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.620]   of the truth? That's the thing that happens when Christ dwells and settles in the heart.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:44.580]   And then he says, "Earthly vanities depart, then kindles love divine."
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:51.820]   Oh, let us, I say, go back and read these things and ponder them. Listen to another,
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:57.660]   listen to Charles Wesley saying it. There I've been quoting a writer from the twelfth
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:03.140]   century to you. Come along to the eighteenth century, and Charles Wesley doesn't hesitate
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:15.140]   to say, "Thou, O Christ, art all I want. More than all in thee I find." Is it true
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:23.020]   of us? Can we say it? That's the language of people in whom Christ has taken up his
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:30.300]   abode, in whom Christ dwells. I should have mentioned in the seventeenth century the saintly
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:39.220]   Samuel Rutherford. Read his letters, read the accounts of his life, read this element
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.620]   of Christ mysticism that was so prominent in his experience. A rigid Calvinist, you
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:52.660]   know. But there he was. He knew him, he loved him, and how he loves to speak about him and
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:58.580]   to dwell upon him and his love.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:04.820]   And so I say, you find it running throughout the centuries in men belonging to the different
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:12.100]   theological schools. You turn to a man like Count Zinzendorf, the Moravian, in the eighteenth
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:19.140]   century, and this is what he says, "I have one passion. It is he and he alone."
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:27.980]   No, that's not the sort of language that what we may call the average, ordinary Christian
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.980]   can imply. You can be a Christian, you know, and not yet be able to say that. That's
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.580]   why the apostle was praying for these Ephesians. They believed, yes, they'd been sealed
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.420]   by the Spirit, but they couldn't use this sort of language. They didn't know him
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:47.960]   in this way. He hadn't settled down in their hearts.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:55.660]   It means this, you see, that Christ dominates the life. It means that he rules over the
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:03.940]   whole of our activities. He is the Lord of our life in a real, practical sense. We are
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:11.500]   dominated by him, a kind of Christ intoxication. We love him so much that he is ever central.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:18.580]   Well, I've read these things to you because it seems to me that that is the best way to
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:27.260]   convey this precious truth. Ordinary men and women throughout the centuries, as well as
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:34.460]   exceptional people, have been able to sing like this. Go through your hymn books. Look
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:41.020]   at the sections on the Lord Jesus Christ and on those that express joy and peace and love
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.500]   to God and to Christ. Look at the sections even on consecration and holiness, and you'll
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.820]   find that all these people throughout the running centuries have all had their eye on
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:56.260]   this one thing. That's what made them right. That's what led to the magnificent poetry
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.380]   and this elevated, exalted thought.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:06.780]   Now then, let me end on a practical note. How does all this become possible to us? What
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:12.140]   have we got to do in order to arrive in that position where we really can appropriate this
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.340]   language honestly and make it the language of our own hearts and the expression of our
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:23.660]   own experience? Well, again, you see, it means I've got to repeat verses 16 and 17. They
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.460]   come in the right order. He prays first that God would grant them, according to the riches
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:35.100]   of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. And without
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:41.900]   that it's all hopeless. This is the result of a mighty work of the Holy Spirit within
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:50.020]   us, primarily. The Holy Spirit must work upon our minds and upon our hearts and upon our
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:56.460]   wills. Don't you feel that your mind needs to be strengthened as you confront a truth
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:09.460]   like this? How much easier it is to understand history or literature or geography or geometry
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:17.460]   or law or midson or anything else than this. Haven't you felt this morning as we've
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.980]   been looking into these great abysses, as it were, of truth? Haven't you felt the
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:27.260]   need that your mind needs to be strengthened and it must be strengthened? Otherwise this
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.980]   seems impossible. We all tend to feel by nature like those people who were listening to the
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.540]   Lord when he talked about eating his flesh and drinking his blood. They said, "This
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.460]   is a hard saying. Who can follow this sort of preaching?" And away they went. We need
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:47.380]   our minds to be strengthened in order that we don't collapse, as it were, when we are
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:53.700]   confronted by something so marvelous because our minds can't comprehend them. We can't
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.580]   just sort of take hold of them and say, "I've got this." It always seems to be eluding
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.940]   you and going beyond you. Well, the mind needs to be prepared. Thank God the Holy Spirit
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:09.020]   can do it. You remember how the apostle puts it in writing to the Corinthians? He says,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.380]   "The princes of this world didn't grasp this truth, but God hath revealed them unto
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:21.380]   us by the Spirit, the Spirit that searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:26.340]   Don't despair, my beloved friend. If you find all this rather hard and difficult, remember
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:32.140]   the power of the Holy Spirit and pray that he may strengthen your mind. And our hearts
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   need to be strengthened because you know while we love ourselves, Christ won't come into
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:46.420]   our hearts. And we've got to be rid of the love of self. And that's the most difficult
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.580]   thing in the world, the most difficult thing of all, in all experience. The real battle
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.780]   in the Christian life is to get rid of self and of self-love. And you know you and I alone
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.460]   can't do it. You drive him out through the front door, he'll come in through the back
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.580]   door, he'll come in through the windows, he'll come in down the chimney, he'll come
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:10.580]   somewhere. Oh, the difficulty of getting rid of self-love. But Christ won't come there
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:17.580]   until there's room for him. You've got to get rid of self. And you can't create love,
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:24.700]   you can't work it up. Nothing is so foolish as to try to work up love. It can't be done.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.300]   Love is the gift of God through the Spirit. So we must pray that he'll strengthen the
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:36.140]   heart for this pure love which is so strange to us as natural men and women. And then you
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:43.140]   know the will needs to be strengthened. Isn't this your experience? You listen to a passage
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   like this and you say, "I'd cut off my right hand if I could only have that. Now I'm going
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.980]   in for that, I must have it." But you know by tomorrow night you may well have forgotten
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:57.140]   all about it. Indeed, you may have forgotten all about it before you finish your lunch
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:02.340]   today. You'll start talking about something else and it'll have gone. You were fully resolved
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.820]   in the service, you were going to do it. But then you take up this or that and enter into
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.300]   an argument and talk about trivialities. And you've forgotten all about it. And you come
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.980]   back next Sunday and you say, "Ah, I thought by now I'd have known this." But you haven't
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.500]   applied yourself. Your will is too weak. All our wills are weak. We're always proposing,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.220]   we're always resolving, but we don't keep up with it, we don't go on. And the will needs
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:34.220]   this strength. Very well. We therefore must pray that the Holy Spirit will thus strengthen
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:45.100]   us. You see the apostle was praying that constantly for the Ephesians. It is my business as one
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:50.660]   was called to minister this word in this place to pray for all of you. I try to do so. God
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:56.460]   forgive me for my failure. But my dear friend, you must pray for yourself. If you realize
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:03.460]   that this is a possibility, I say go on praying this until you know it. Pray that you may
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.660]   be strengthened with this power, this might of the Spirit in your inner man. And then
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.660]   you see as that happens to you, this is what will follow. You will begin to see your sin
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.140]   and your sinfulness in a way that you've never seen it before. You thought you knew about
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.260]   sin, you'll discover that you didn't. You'll discover a vileness in yourself you couldn't
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:27.860]   even have imagined. It's no longer a question of doing this or that. There is an evil in
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   your very nature and you'll begin to mortify the flesh. You'll begin to act. You'll cleanse
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:45.420]   your heart, you'll cleanse your hands, you'll purify your flesh and your spirit as this
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.820]   apostle exhorts the Corinthians to do. Why? Well, you'll realize that it's something like
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:57.820]   this. Whenever you invite a guest to come and stay in your home, you always begin to
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:09.220]   tidy up, don't you? You want the place to look nice. You're quite right, it would be
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:14.980]   insulting to your guest not to do so. You want everything to be as perfect as possible.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:20.060]   You're paying your guest a very subtle and delicate compliment. If you have some great
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.900]   personage coming to stay with you, you'll redouble your efforts. There's nothing you
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   won't do. You'll clean, you'll re-paper, you'll paint, you'll make the place as near as you
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:36.900]   can to a palace. Why, well, a great personage is coming to stay with you. And you see what
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   you and I have been considering together? Is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:53.300]   coming to dwell with you? Not just to pay a visit, but to make his home with you. It
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:58.700]   needs preparation, doesn't it? Yes, you see, the apostle knew it needed it. That's why
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.980]   he was praying for it. And as we thus become strengthened, we act. We'll get rid of the
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:10.140]   rubbish. We'll cleanse and purify ourselves, mortify the flesh, deliberately keep out things
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.740]   that we know are not compatible with him, or would hurt him, or grieve him, or offend
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:21.740]   him. We'll do all that we can. And we'll go on doing it. We'll plead with him to come.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:29.860]   We'll yearn for him. See, that's where the faith comes in, that Christ may dwell in your
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:36.380]   hearts through faith, believing in the possibility, knowing that it can become an actuality. You
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.380]   see, faith here doesn't mean take it by faith, which means that you persuade yourself that
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.420]   he's come. No, no, my dear friend, when Christ dwells in your heart, you won't need to persuade
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:52.420]   yourself, you'll know it. You'll be able to say, "Thou sweetest, most ineffable, in whom
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:59.420]   all joys are found." This pernicious doctrine of taking it by faith, and knowing that it
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.100]   is faith, I believe has hindered many people at this point. They say, "Ah, yes, I've opened
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.700]   the door, I've let him in, I believe my faith is there." They don't feel any different.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   They can't use this language. Why? Well, because he is not dwelling there. When he dwells within,
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:22.620]   well, we know it. There's nothing else that matters. It's the supreme thing. It is the
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:30.460]   most glorious thing of all. Very well, then, I say, let us realize the glorious, wondrous
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:36.220]   possibility. If he's ever visited us, let's go back to him and say, "Come and stay. Leave
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:43.220]   me, not come and take up thine abode and thy dwelling with me." Strengthened with might
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:51.500]   by his Spirit in the inner man, praying in faith, keeping on and on and on, and then
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:58.940]   on and on, until we can honestly appropriate the language and say with the great apostle,
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:08.500]   "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Amen.
