[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   - How does many worlds help us understand
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.780]   our particular branch of reality?
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.320]   So okay, that's fine and good,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.840]   that is everything is splitting,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.260]   but we're just traveling down a single branch of it.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.080]   So how does it help us understand our little unique branch?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.840]   - Yeah, I mean, that's a great question.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640]   But that's the point is that we didn't invent many worlds
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.600]   'cause we thought it was cool
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.920]   to have a whole bunch of worlds, right?
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.480]   We invented it because we were trying to account
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.200]   for what we observe here in our world.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.120]   And what we observe here in our world
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.560]   are wave functions collapsing, okay?
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   We do have a situation where the electron
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.520]   seems to be spread out, but then when we look at it,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.120]   we don't see it spread out, we see it located somewhere.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120]   So what's going on?
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.920]   That's the measurement problem of quantum mechanics,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.400]   that's what we have to face up to.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.120]   So many worlds is just a proposed solution to that problem.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.720]   And the answer is nothing special is happening,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.600]   it's still just the Schrodinger equation,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.880]   but you have a wave function too.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880]   And that's a different answer than would be given
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.960]   in hidden variables or dynamical collapse theories
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.000]   or whatever.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.480]   So the entire point of many worlds
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.360]   is to explain what we observe,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.160]   but it tries to explain what we already have observed,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.640]   right, it's not trying to be different
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.600]   from what we've observed,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.120]   because that would be something other than quantum mechanics.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.600]   - But the idea that there's worlds that we didn't observe
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.560]   that keep branching off is kind of,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.040]   it's stimulating to the imagination.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.480]   So is it possible to hop from,
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.680]   you mentioned the branches are independent.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.360]   Is it possible to hop from one to the other?
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200]   - No.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.880]   - So it's a physical limit.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.280]   The theory says it's impossible.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.720]   - There's already a copy of you in the other world,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   don't worry.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.520]   - Yes.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   - Then leave them alone.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.160]   - No, but there's a fear of missing out, FOMO.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.000]   - Yes.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.080]   - But I feel like immediately start to wonder
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.440]   if that other copy is having more or less fun.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.040]   - Yeah, well, the downside to many worlds
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.400]   is that you're missing out on an enormous amount.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.640]   (laughing)
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280]   And that's always what it's gonna be like.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600]   - And I mean, there's a certain stage of acceptance in that.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   - Yes.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.480]   - In terms of rewinding,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   do you think we can rewind the system back?
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.040]   Sort of the nice thing about many worlds, I guess,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.240]   is it really emphasizes the,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.480]   maybe you can correct me,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.940]   but the deterministic nature of a branch.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.680]   And it feels like it could be rewound back.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.360]   Do you see as something that could be
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.400]   perfectly rewinded back?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.240]   - Yeah.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.840]   If you're at a fancy French restaurant,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080]   and there's a nice linen white tablecloth,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   and you have your glass of Bordeaux,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.760]   and you knock it over,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   and the wine spills across the tablecloth,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.960]   if the world were classical, okay,
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.240]   it would be possible
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   that if you just lifted the wine glass up,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.680]   you'd be lucky enough that every molecule of wine
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.440]   would hop back into the glass, right?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.280]   But guess what?
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.080]   It's not gonna happen in the real world.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.040]   And the quantum wave function is exactly the same way.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.800]   It is possible in principle to rewind everything
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   if you start from perfect knowledge
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.880]   of the entire wave function of the universe.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.320]   In practice, it's never gonna happen.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.120]   - So time travel, not possible?
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400]   - Nope.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.560]   At least quantum mechanics has no help.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.520]   - What about memory?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.440]   Does the universe have a memory of itself
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.360]   where we could,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   so not time travel,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.180]   but peek back in time,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.240]   and do a little replay?
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.120]   - Well, it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120]   as classical mechanics.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360]   So whatever you wanna say about that,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.160]   the fundamental laws of physics
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.080]   in either many worlds, quantum mechanics,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.480]   or Newtonian physics,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.160]   conserve information.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.360]   So if you have all the information
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.640]   about the quantum state of the world right now,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.680]   you're Laplace's demon-like in your knowledge
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   and calculational capacity,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.480]   you can wind the clock backward.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   But none of us is, right?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.440]   And so in practice, you can never do that.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.580]   You can do experiments over and over again,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.920]   starting from the same initial conditions for small systems,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   but once things get to be large,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.720]   Avogadro's number of particles, right?
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.600]   Bigger than a cell, no chance.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
