[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280]   - It's been four years now since my book Lit launched
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.440]   and it's sobering to have received literally hundreds
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   of emails from Christians over the years
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.080]   who have struggled to read or who were helped
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.720]   by some of the encouragements in the book.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.640]   And books and literacy are powerful tools
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.380]   in the Christian life, as you well know, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.600]   And I recently perused your little blue copy
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.840]   of The Weight of Glory, a C.S. Lewis paperback
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.200]   you bought in the fall of 1968.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.120]   And I know you can still remember standing in the bookstore,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.200]   reading that book for the first time
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240]   and reading those first few pages
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.400]   and having your life changed by that little blue paperback.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   Great books have that power.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.960]   And I've been wanting to ask you,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.920]   speaking from a macro perspective,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.740]   what has been the role of books in your life?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.160]   - Well, what a wonderful question.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.560]   It would be hard to overstate the life-shaping impact
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.240]   of books on my life, but I'm wired in such a way
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.520]   that I even feel uncomfortable saying that
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.680]   without giving a reason for it.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.960]   Like I need to give a justification
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.120]   for why books can have such an impact on my life.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.480]   So if it's okay with you,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.080]   I'm going to go back a little bit and lay a foundation.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.600]   And foundation number one is the Bible is a book.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.400]   The implications of that fact are simply staggering.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.560]   When God contemplated all the possible ways
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.360]   that existed for him as an infinite, omnipotent,
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.360]   all-wise God to transmit and preserve
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.360]   his revelation to the world, he chose a book.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.640]   And that's simply astonishing.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.120]   We have no other authoritative access to the knowledge
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.840]   of God and the way of salvation and how to live a life
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440]   pleasing to the Lord than through this book,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.560]   either directly by reading it or indirectly
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.260]   from others who have read it.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.160]   The book is absolutely unique.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   It's inspired in all of its words,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   and that inspiration secures the sufficiency of the book
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440]   in equipping us for every good deed.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.360]   I mean, that very phrase in 2 Timothy 2, 17,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780]   every good deed is amazing to me.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.400]   It's an awesome claim that we are equipped,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.320]   fitted out by this book for every good deed
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.560]   that God expects of us.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.260]   He won't expect of us anything he doesn't equip us to do
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.080]   through this book.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.060]   So it's astonishing how unique and powerful this book is.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.480]   And then you add to that Ephesians 3, 4,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.720]   where Paul said, "When you read this,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ."
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   That's breathtaking to me, that reading the book.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.040]   So the inspiration of the book and the reading of the book
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880]   are the junctures between God and man
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.680]   where saving truth is moved from the divine mind
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.320]   into the human mind and spirit.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.960]   This is just staggering implications of saying
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.920]   that reading is the way you can perceive my insight
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.200]   into the mystery of Christ, Paul says.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   And of course, it's not possible
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.000]   without the almighty agency of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   It's not merely an intellectual affair,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.320]   but it's not less than an intellectual affair
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.240]   because God has ordained that his truth come through a book.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.040]   And reading is a work of the mind.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440]   And of course, it also doesn't mean,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.880]   nothing I've said is I intend to imply
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.760]   that we could just go about this
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.960]   in our own little private cubicle
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.060]   without taking anybody else into account.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.880]   The Bible is crystal clear that God has appointed pastors
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.960]   and teachers, people with spiritual gifts,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.320]   and those gifts include wisdom and knowledge and prophecy
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.400]   and teaching and other ways that humans clarify
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.320]   and apply and inspire us with the scriptures.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.760]   So even though God is giving us a book,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.960]   he means for us to understand the book and apply the book
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.280]   and be inspired by the book
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.360]   with the help of other people who are dead
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.680]   and left their insights in books
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   and who are alive and teach us and preach and counsel
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   and converse with us.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   So once the reality of God's privileging the written word
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.440]   with his choice of a book as the decisive means
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440]   by which he would reveal and preserve
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.880]   the revelation of himself, once that has sunk in,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.920]   you just can never be indifferent to the reality of books.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.040]   Again, God has privileged the book, honored the book,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.120]   elevated the book, esteemed the book
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   above all other means for his centuries-long preservation
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.700]   and explanation of his revelation.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.180]   So when I say it would be hard to overstate
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.060]   the life-shaping impact of books on my life,
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.180]   I think I'm saying something very much in line
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.860]   with God's purposes for the world,
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.080]   all that to justify my sentence.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.560]   So let me be specific and answer your question.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.360]   Number one, books have shown me the glory
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   and the greatness and the character
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.600]   and the attributes and the beauties of God.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.760]   Jonathan Edwards' "Freedom of the Will,"
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.680]   essay on the Trinity, dozens of sermons.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.840]   John Owen on the death of death and the glories of Christ
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   in communion with God.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.380]   Stephen Charnock on the attributes of God.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.680]   That book sat on my bedside table for almost a decade,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.780]   I think, because I could only manage a few pages a night.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.300]   It was so dense with glorious truths about God.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.580]   Number two, books have convicted me of sin.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.760]   In fact, most books convict me of sin one way or the other.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.260]   There was an extended period of time in Germany
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.480]   when every Sunday evening I would read an extended portion
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.720]   of Edwards' religious affections
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.460]   and found myself devastated week in and week out
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.260]   as he peeled away the layers of the self-exaltation
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.020]   of my heart.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.700]   Number three, books have shown me the path of righteousness.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.020]   I think of Drandy Alcorn's book on pro-life arguments
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.300]   or Carl Ellis on free at last and the experience
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.200]   of black Christianity in the 20th century
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.440]   or Soren Kierkegaard and George MacDonald and Ralph Winter
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.460]   on wartime uses of material possessions.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.940]   Number four, books have given me inspiration
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.060]   and encouragement in some of my most difficult days
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.940]   and I'm thinking here mainly of biography.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.140]   T.H.L. Parker on Calvin and Peter Brown on Augustine
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.940]   and Courtney Anderson on Ednar M. Judson.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.500]   And it was a season when I was reading,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.980]   I think there are about three volumes of little,
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.980]   little vignettes by Warren Wearsby about great pastors.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.980]   Number five, books have shaped the way I think
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.180]   and the way I express myself.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.920]   And here I'm thinking, of course, of C.S. Lewis.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   Here, razor sharp logic and a deep belief
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.380]   in the reality of reason and logic
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.260]   while never elevating it above the essential importance
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.400]   of the imagination and the affections.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   And it's not just only his deep belief in exemplification,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.340]   setting an example of logic, but the touchable,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   smellable, tasteable concreteness of his language.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.080]   Oh, the power of the concrete over the abstract
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.500]   in helping people grasp the greatest things.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   Number six, books have cultivated deep convictions in me
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.240]   about things like the aims of reading.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.040]   I think here of E.D. Hirsch in his book,
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.880]   "Validity Interpretation" that persuaded me profoundly
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.520]   that the only objective grounds for any claim to validity
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.440]   in one's interpretation is that we have found
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   an author's intention in writing.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.040]   I think that's right and what a vast implication it has
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   for how you read everything.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.360]   And then finally, I would say books have clarified for me
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.820]   biblical concepts that I may never have gotten
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.720]   good clarity on myself because of how extensive
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   the scope of one's grasp needs to be of scriptures
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.420]   in order to synthesize the way books do.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.480]   And I'm thinking here of George Ladd, for example,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.820]   one of my professors, George Ladd's "New Testament Theology"
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.360]   or his book, "The Presence of the Future."
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.180]   So that's a tip of the iceberg.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.800]   To the person, Tony, who struggles with reading,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.480]   I would simply say, join me.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.680]   Join limited, slow reading John Piper.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.800]   Admit your limitations.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   Lay down all resentments and anger and self-pity
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.760]   and self-justification and humbly accept your limitations,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.640]   admit them, and then do the best you can.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   Be thankful for every measure of reading you're able to do.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.160]   - Amen, that is wonderful and life-giving counsel,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.080]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.540]   And thank you for bearing with some of the technical issues
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.140]   on the audio on Pastor John's end we're struggling with.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.560]   We're just simply recording through Skype
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.960]   for the time being and we will get that fixed soon.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.360]   Well, should we Christians care
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.840]   about how the world thinks of us?
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.000]   It's an important question
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.360]   and it's got an interesting twist to it as well.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.120]   John Piper will explain next time why.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.280]   For more on this podcast,

[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.320]   (upbeat music)
