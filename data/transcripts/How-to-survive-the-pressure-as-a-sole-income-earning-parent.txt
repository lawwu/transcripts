[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this podcast
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.360]   I'm gonna talk about how to survive the pressure as a sole income earning parent
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.060]   So before my son was born, I read several books on how to become a better parent after all
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.120]   This is my first son and I wanted to be prepared and I also knew that a lot of couples
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.160]   Divorced after having kids and I knew the statistic that
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.160]   Marital happiness declines by something like 80 to 90 percent in the first few
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.680]   Years and that's some serious stuff. So I didn't want to mess around
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.600]   So I spent hours and hours reading as many books as possible
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.120]   And what I noticed is that a lot of the books talked about you know, how to be a supportive
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.560]   Husband this for my example, right during the pregnancy process and then how to be a supportive husband
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.480]   After she gives birth talking about postpartum depression talking about support mental support
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.080]   physical support
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.160]   Working through work issues and stuff like that, but there was never really much said about
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.880]   supporting the sole income earning parent now, it's interesting because
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.240]   To me obviously being a full-time parent is much much harder than being a day job worker
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   It really is folks. I mean you have no idea if you have don't have kids
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.560]   It is so much harder to be a full-time parent because of the stakes, right?
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.320]   So one look away, you know could be really devastating
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.600]   However at work you can slack off chill out at the water cooler
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.160]   talk trash about your colleagues and your boss attend social events and
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   Drink copious amounts of free alcohol and everything will probably be okay
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.880]   However as an emotionally competent sole income earning parent you face the following issues
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.680]   One you have this constant stress of knowing that you have to provide for your family with no financial backup
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.200]   So it's hard enough to provide for a spouse who doesn't work
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.480]   But if you have an amazing amazing little one who depends on you for everything
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.400]   Because he or she doesn't know better and doesn't have any skills. Well that stress ramps up
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   - you have a constant guilt for being away from your child because of work, right?
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   You are choosing money and work over your child and that's hard for some people
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.240]   Three you're not able to find support because a day job is considered the easier job, right?
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.960]   I'm talking about mental support from other people who can empathize with you and then finally, you know
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   It's the expectation of having to do an equal amount of parenting after a long day's work
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.960]   Now some of you might find that to be strange
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   but in
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.320]   2018 and modern society there is a strong pressure for you not to only be a income provider, but also a
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.040]   Equal partner in parenting as well
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.840]   So many couples fight over this division of labor the sole income provider often wants to come home
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.920]   Have a drink eat dinner, maybe watch some TV and relax before jumping into parenting duties
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.520]   Especially after a rough day. Meanwhile, the stay-at-home parent who has been going non-stop since the little one woke up at 6 a.m
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.800]   Is probably not gonna have any of that
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.000]   He or she might resent the expectation of you wanting to come home and chillax
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.920]   Because nothing is as energy-sapping as caring for an infant, right?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.000]   The stakes are so high and the sole income provider is resentful for not being allowed to take even half an hour to unwind
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   So you can clearly see how problems ensue and why marital happiness takes a big nose dive down in the first several years
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.200]   So in this podcast and in the post
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   I want to see if we can help the sole income providing parent get him or her to a happier place
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.320]   Now if you want to focus on the stay-at-home parent
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   Well, this one's not for you because there are books and books and books written about how to help support that stay-at-home parent
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.960]   Which is more likely the mom. So I've got six points. I want to discuss
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.000]   first take everybody's opinion with a grain of salt
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.360]   Guilt comes from inherently knowing spending more time taking care of your child is better than spending less time
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.880]   Especially in the crucial first five years of development
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   Guilt also stems from other people's opinions about what you should do
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.880]   Especially if people criticize you for choosing work and money over being a parent. It's good to get advice from more experienced parents
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   Absolutely, that's that's one of the secrets to life. Just ask people who've been there before
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.480]   However as a writer who shares my struggles in finance and in fatherhood
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.320]   I've come to realize that whatever you put out there will be judged
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.360]   Further a lot of parents project their guilt on to you due to their lack of parenting
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.640]   for example
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.320]   I shared with readers in my 2018 mid-year review that I wanted to provide six hours of joyful assistance or
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.440]   Primary care to my wife and son during his waking hours. So he's up for about 12 hours a day
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.680]   I use the word assistance because during the first year of life
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.200]   Breastfeeding is constant and I do not have the ability to breastfeed as a man and trust me
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.240]   I looked up whether there were any breastfeeding contraptions for men, but couldn't find a viable solution
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.680]   So I use the words primary care so that I take full charge for a couple hours in the morning
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.360]   Especially after a rough night because my son really didn't sleep well or at least seven eight hours
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.000]   consistently non-stop for the first
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.880]   Ten to twelve months really because we didn't do the cry it out method because we didn't have anywhere to go to for work
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.680]   And then I also wanted to provides a couple hours in the afternoon of primary care
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   So she could have time to herself to relax and do whatever she wants to catch up on things and on my quote off hours
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.440]   Which were on my work hours really I get to work writing and managing our investments
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.240]   Which itself could be a full-time job in order for my wife to be a stay-at-home mom with me
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.480]   Seems like a reasonable effort, right? I don't know just trying I think is is an important thing that everybody should do just try harder
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.960]   But not according to a reader named Sarah who ignored my words primary care and wrote Sam
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.860]   I can't believe I didn't catch this before
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.560]   Quote assistance to your wife
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.760]   really
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.000]   parenting cooking cleaning etc are part of being an adult and a parent and
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.960]   Equally your responsibility as hers. This is in the 1950s
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.000]   You're not assisting your wife. You're being a responsible adult in a relationship who shares childcare and
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.360]   Housekeeping duties. I can't believe this is even a goal of yours
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   It's certainly not something you should celebrate if you achieve it as it's really the bare minimum
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.600]   Standard of being a parent and a spouse
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.040]   so whoa, I
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.840]   Read that I was thinking
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.080]   Really Sarah here. I am putting myself out there
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   Trying to do more parenting going from four hours to six hours. He's awake for 12 hours a day and
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.200]   I was thinking hey, maybe I can assist for half the time
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.560]   He's awake and here you are bashing me over the head for trying and it was really interesting
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.720]   I was totally confused by her comment because it seemed really really
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   Unempathetic one and then she followed up and said look I
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.320]   Send my child to daycare
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.160]   And I'll see myself really so you're bashing me for trying to take more care of my son
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.760]   While you and your husband decide to send your child to daycare so you can work all day
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.840]   It totally was a messed up situation, right?
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.760]   and so this type of judgment is why people why parents feel so guilty and
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.600]   So this is a comment where you could see how it could start a huge fight after coming home from a full day of work
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   If you're the sole income provider
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:18.480]   You can also see how some men are too afraid to be stay-at-home dads due to the criticism and lack of support from other
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.240]   Parents, you know when stay-at-home dads just make up 2% of all stay-at-home
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.760]   Parents, it's easy to get overrun by the majority
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.480]   So I just really want folks to be more empathetic to those other parents your fellow parents
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:39.520]   Don't make it a competition and to support them for trying because we all know it's really really difficult
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.680]   So the only right way is what you and your spouse decide is the right way through constant dialogue
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.080]   You need that constant dialogue. It's your life. Don't let anybody come between you and your partner
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.040]   Certainly don't let other parents project their guilt onto you
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.080]   We're trying to do better. Well, Sarah did end up apologizing in the end and that's cool. I accepted that apology
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.720]   Just know that whatever things that you're trying to go through just deal with them yourself
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.840]   There's no use putting other people down
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:16.840]   To be explicitly clear about the budget money stress is strong when you're the only one generating income
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.760]   so if you're the stay-at-home spouse really realize this as
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.080]   A result make sure you and your spouse know your exact
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.800]   After-tax income in order to calculate how much of the income can be spent on supporting the family while also saving for retirement
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.600]   Paying down debt and saving for your child's education
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.840]   Don't just break down your expense budget by month figure out how much the family can spend by week and stick to it
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:48.200]   After each week review the actual expenses with the budget and give yourselves a high-five celebrate when you spend less
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.160]   This exercise will help reduce the sole income providers anxiety
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.800]   Because there will always be a little worry when even the person you trust the most is in charge of spending
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.920]   Now before our son was born
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.800]   I gave my wife a carte blanche green light to spend as much as she needed to prepare for our son's arrival
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.160]   you know, we signed up for Amazon Prime and
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.280]   She got everything and she was awesome and getting everything that we needed that our son needed
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:21.200]   After our son was born the green light continued for a full year without us discussing a single item of expense and in retrospect
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   This was a bad move
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.040]   We should have reviewed our budget because after the first year I began carrying some anxiety
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.960]   For months that we were spending about two and a half times more than reality
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.800]   So it felt like such a relief after I actually saw the expense report when she tallied up the numbers
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.840]   three
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.800]   Practice gratitude you're able to work and have a stay-at-home spouse
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.160]   Gratitude always helps dissolve any festering resentment or bitterness
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.120]   Instead of seeing being a sole income provider as a burden see it as a luxury and as an honor
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.080]   Two parent households where both parents work full-time
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:07.280]   Today account for about 46 percent of the population compared to just 31 percent in the 1970s
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.680]   This is according to Pew Research Center. Now. Why is that? Well, it's simple
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.480]   It just costs more and more to live with housing prices
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.720]   Tuition and childcare. It's tough because wage inflation is not keeping pace
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.840]   So if you can have the person you love and trust the most take care of your child full-time
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.920]   Before going off to preschool or kindergarten. It's a wonderful blessing remind each other daily of this luxury
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.680]   For know that it gets better after your child goes to preschool or kindergarten
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.640]   a child usually starts preschool between the age of
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.480]   Two to three and kindergarten between the ages of five and six
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.660]   Therefore no matter how much pain and suffering and frustration you're dealing with now
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.200]   Know that your schedule will get easier for both of you within six years for a developmentally normal child
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   As soon as you commit to a timeline goal, everything becomes easier to accomplish
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:08.820]   For example, a lot of people ask me how can I continue to publish several times a week since 2009?
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.480]   Well to me, it's not that hard because I set a goal and I said I wouldn't do it for ten years in a row
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:22.560]   Ten years so that ten-year anniversary is in 2019 July and so to quit now would be a travesty. I'm so close
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:29.720]   So I'm just gonna keep on going no matter what sure there will be more child raising issues that come up as your little one ages
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.800]   But with more sleep and free time during the day you can do a lot more things
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.000]   five
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.320]   Take mental sick days very seriously feeling the pressure to provide is not a physical pressure
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.640]   It's a mental pressure feeling the guilt of not being able to raise your children
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.320]   Instead paying someone you don't really know to raise your children can be mental torture
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.440]   When your mind breaks down you don't do your best work you become irritable
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.280]   Combative and sometimes very volatile mental illness can lead to neglect
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.920]   fights over stupid things
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.480]   adultery
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:15.160]   Divorce and sometimes even suicide. So for goodness sake, please don't be ashamed to take all your sick and vacation days
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.520]   Please know the Family and Medical Leave Act is a federal law that guarantees certain employees
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   Up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave each year with no threat of job loss
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.680]   Be open with your colleagues about why you need time off if they are good people
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   Especially if they have families of their own they'll understand and then finally six
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.560]   Have your stay-at-home spouse generate some income if gratitude
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.440]   budgeting
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.600]   patience taking time off and
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:52.120]   Ignoring other parents opinions don't work. The only solution left is to have your spouse start earning income again
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.800]   the income can be generated preferably through freelance work or through a part-time job and
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.000]   preferably after your son or daughter starts sleeping better and
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.600]   preferably after they start going to school and
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.400]   If you can run your own business from home even better
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.640]   some households
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.160]   Simply cannot afford to have one spouse stay at home until their little one goes to preschool or kindergarten
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.120]   I understand that money stress can really strain a relationship
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   Even if being a stay-at-home spouse is worth a hundred thousand dollar plus your job
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.200]   Just know that there are now plenty of ways to make money online
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.400]   Now through freelance marketplaces like up work based here in San Francisco or task rabbit
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:41.000]   There are a dozen things you can do from design and creative to admin support like data entry
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.320]   transcription web research to customer service
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.840]   sales and marketing
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   writing IT and networking
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.880]   analytics
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.200]   translation legal engineering architecture accounting and consulting and
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.600]   You have no skills in any of that
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   You can always perhaps drive for uber or lyft like I did
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.960]   When I gave over 500 rides to check it out and see what it was like
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.600]   Just know there are a lot of things you can do now to make money from the comfort of your own home
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.040]   Not only is my wife an amazing mom. She is also an amazing online business partner
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.460]   I couldn't have done it without her for so long
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.760]   Once our son started sleeping for at least seven to eight hours stretches on a regular basis
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.040]   She began updating older posts with fresh content and writing new pages on top of the quarterly bookkeeping that she does
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:36.080]   Not only did her work help our business. It also gave her a lot of pride and satisfaction as well
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.160]   So definitely get your spouse involved if she or he has more time as the sole income earning spouse
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.600]   Although it may not seem like you're doing enough when you come home to a tired and stressed out spouse who sometimes
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.240]   Will make you feel guilty for being away from the house all day
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.120]   Know that you are doing a great great service to your family
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.300]   The person you trust the most can be a stay-at-home spouse because of you
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.240]   Practice gratitude every day keep the dialogue running. So resentment does not build up
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.360]   Forgive each other the first five years before kindergarten right give each other passes
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.080]   Don't listen to the criticism of others who don't walk in your shoes
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:21.440]   Please take time off to heal your mind and finally cherish every single moment every single moment
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:28.800]   I can't believe my son is 16 months old now that time went by so quick and I remember the day
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.680]   He was born. It was just like yesterday and all these little milestone moments from his first crawl to his first step
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.720]   To his first babble are priceless
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.900]   I wouldn't give up anything and I hope everyone can figure out what best works for them
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.560]   I'd love to hear your thoughts if you are a sole income provider and how you've been able to make things work and how you plan
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.880]   To make things work going forward. Thanks so much
