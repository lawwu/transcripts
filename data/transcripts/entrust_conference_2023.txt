[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.400]   We felt that the podium we had was not manly enough,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.200]   so we got a bigger podium, more manly.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.280]   Or maybe it's just Phillip's more manly.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.920]   I don't know.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   What is it, Phillip?
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120]   All right, you guys, let's get started.

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   It's not Brussels sprouts or finger sandwiches
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   or something, right?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   So of course you enjoyed it, so that's good.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.480]   All right, so a little more fun.

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.800]   Malachi, is that you?

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.560]   So therefore, God also has highly exalted him
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.200]   and given him the name which is above every name,

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   We exalt Him.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.160]   I guess that's one way to measure a man.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.920]   When he's on his knees, does he touch the throne of God?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:22:00.360]   But this story raises a wider question, being asked in our culture, or being asked because
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:06.080]   of our culture, what is the true measure of a man?
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.960]   What is the trademarks of manhood?
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.120]   What are the marks of a man that distinguishes him from a woman?
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:20.920]   Now, by way of introduction, on the one hand, when measuring a man, there is a growing sense,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.160]   especially in the culture, there is no measure.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:33.040]   Manhood and masculinity, we're being told, are not fixed realities.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.280]   They are malleable.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.920]   They are transferable.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.640]   They are fluid.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   That's why today we have the paradox and the oxymoron of a masculine woman and a feminine
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.920]   man.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.740]   Today Harry not only meets Sally, Harry can become Sally.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.700]   Today men can have babies.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:02.880]   The sad fact is that the culture's talk and the culture's trends point to gender fluidity.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.720]   That manhood and womanhood, masculinity and femininity are performative.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.160]   Owen talks about that in his book.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.920]   That's why you have a Supreme Court judge appointee and candidate, Catania Jackson,
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.960]   unable to define what a woman is.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.840]   That's where we're at.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   My father just turned 90.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.040]   He still lives in Belfast in Northern Ireland.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.320]   He was a radio capture, not registered.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.680]   Our family went down to Dublin to watch a rugby game between Ulster and Leinster.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.920]   I decided not to be left out.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.480]   I flew to Dublin, met with my family, went to the rugby game.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.400]   Then we took my dad to dinner.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.720]   That night over dinner, we said, "Dad, you're 90.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.800]   You've seen a lot of things come and go."
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.880]   What have been some of the surprises?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   You know what he said?
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.920]   "I never thought I'd see the day when women could become men and men could become women."
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.360]   That's a strange day.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.760]   The fixed moorings and the fixed norms of a generation ago regarding masculinity, courage,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.960]   work ethic, stoicism, competitiveness, strong leadership, marriage, bearing children, answering
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   the call to protect and provide, that's now seen as oppressive.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.320]   We're being told that that kind of profile of a man is to be abandoned in the name of
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.480]   social justice.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:40.160]   Manhood as it has been traditionally defined is now opposed, deconstructed, and reformed.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.040]   On the other hand, when measuring a man by any measurement, men are failing to measure
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.460]   up.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.960]   Men are not only in transition, they're in trouble.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:01.400]   Men according to Owen, and he outlined this this morning and he details it in his book,
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:09.560]   men are in trouble and failing educationally and economically, socially and spiritually,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.360]   physically and parentally.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:22.920]   Brothers, men are drowning and our culture has no intention of throwing them a lifeline.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.720]   Men are not leading.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.280]   Men are not even leading from behind.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   Men are just behind.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.320]   SWB audio capture not registered.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.360]   Skill of measurement.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   Michael Ian Black lamented the fact that men are not what they should be or could be.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.680]   He says this, "To be a girl today is to be the beneficiary of decades of conversation
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.800]   about the complexities of womanhood, its many forms and expressions.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.320]   Boys though have been left behind.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.760]   No commensurate movement has emerged to help them navigate towards a full expression of
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.000]   their gender.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.880]   It's no longer enough to be a man.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.280]   We no longer even know what that means."
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   Most universities in America have a women's department.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.680]   Almost none have a men's department.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.440]   The conversation today is one-sided.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.000]   How do we enhance the health of a woman?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.680]   How do we develop her potential?
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.160]   How do we help her become all that she should be?
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.840]   But on the other side of the argument, crickets.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:51.720]   So given these realities, as we seek to measure a man, some tell us there is no measurement.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.920]   And as we look at men, they're certainly not measuring up to past measurements.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:06.080]   I want to take you to 1 Timothy 3 verses 1 to 7, which is a description of the man of
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.700]   God.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.920]   That term will be used in chapter 6, verse 11.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.840]   It's a technical term of man called and commissioned by God to lead the people of God.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:25.800]   And so what we have here is a description and a profile of the man of God.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.080]   And it comes from the sufficient, authoritative, eternal, and inerrant Word of God.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.800]   Here we have the true measure of a man from the true measure of all things, the Word of
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.880]   God itself.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:53.840]   Contextually, Paul is identifying highly qualified men for church leadership.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.100]   A man either called an elder bishop or pastor.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.600]   And the thing I want us to remember as we move forward through this text is that that
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.420]   man, that man of God, over the people of God, is the measure of a man.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.160]   He's to be an exemplary man.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:23.620]   Hebrews 13, verse 7, we're told this, "Remember those who rule over you, who have spoken the
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:31.400]   Word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of their conduct."
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.480]   In fact, I should have done this verse, 1 Timothy 4, verse 12, "Let no one despise your
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.600]   youth, Timothy, but be an example to the believers in word."
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:50.860]   If you go to 1 Peter 5, the elder overseer, pastor, is to be an example to the flock.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.560]   Here we have a template.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.560]   Here we have a benchmark against which every man in the congregation should measure himself.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:09.000]   Not all men are called to be elders, but we're all called to be like elders, to mirror their
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.760]   character and their characteristics.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:19.040]   You'll see from the opening verse, this is a faithful saying that Paul is underlining
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.360]   something important.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:28.200]   That free as faithful saying typically speaks to something of essential importance, something
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.120]   of abiding relevance.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:38.960]   In this case, the abiding relevance and that which is important is the discovery of the
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:46.240]   appointment of highly qualified exemplary male church leaders that become a benchmark
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.280]   for the people of God.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   As we look through the text, I'm going to work my way through it.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.280]   I might kind of drill down on particular parts as I feel they might resonate as to where
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.660]   men are struggling most or a word that men need to hear.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.920]   But if you're beginning to take notes, here's my first thought.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:14.380]   As we measure a man, I want you to notice his wants, his desires, his longings.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:20.520]   Verse one, this is a faithful saying, "If a man desires," notice that, "the position
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.140]   of a bishop, he desires," notice that, "a good work."
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.300]   The Christian leader and the godly man who measures himself against the Christian leader
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:38.940]   is marked by intense longing, deep desire formed around the idea of perceiving and achieving
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.140]   God's will for them.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.420]   That's what's being discussed in verse one.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.300]   The Christian leader is a man called, equipped, and appointed by God.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:55.320]   The Christian leader, the Christian elder, is a man who answers a heavenly summons.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.740]   He senses God is doing something in him.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:05.660]   There are these desires, these irresistible desires to take the mantle of leadership.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.780]   The word of God is burning in his bones, to use the words of Jeremiah.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:18.060]   You'll notice that he is stirred by a godly vision of things and stretches toward what
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.200]   he perceives to be God's will.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.760]   His life is driven.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.700]   God has planted desires in his heart that he seeks to achieve, and he seeks to achieve
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.900]   them by being the best he can be for God's glory.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.300]   I love Acts 13.36.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.380]   I quoted it, I think, earlier today, but I'm not sure.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:49.500]   It says this, "David served his generation by the will of God."
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.380]   David woke up to the reality of who he was, what God wanted him to become, and he became
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.420]   it, and he served the generation.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.740]   Let me unpack these two words here.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.380]   They're the same in the English text, but they are two different Greek words.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:13.020]   The first Greek word for desire is to set one's heart on.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:18.060]   It's a word that means to stretch after.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.460]   It's to exert oneself in a certain direction.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.940]   That's what a man of God does.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.500]   Certainly in the case of an elder, he has a sense that God is calling him to that, and
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.140]   he exerts himself in that direction.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.980]   So life now bends toward that goal.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:45.340]   The second word in the Greek text in desire means a passionate compulsion.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.660]   It speaks of inward feelings.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:57.300]   And so what we've got here is that the man of God is driven by an inner compulsion to
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:02.820]   serve his generation by the will of God, which in his case means local church leadership.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:09.020]   And given that discovery, he now takes all the faculties of mind and heart and body and
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.500]   talent and time, and he bends his life toward that.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.660]   That's my point.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:21.180]   So here's the takeaway as we look at the measure of a man, his wants.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.980]   Did you notice there's no passivity here?
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.380]   There's no floundering here.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.380]   There's no muddling.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.860]   There's no meandering.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.140]   This is a man driven.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.940]   This is a man desirous of a Godward direction in his life.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:43.100]   When it comes to life lived for God's glory, the godly man gets after it.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.780]   And the godly man goes after it.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:56.080]   God is calling you to be aspirational, to have a set desired direction for your life
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.580]   rooted in your understanding of God's will for you in general and God's will for you
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   in particular.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:09.300]   And once you begin to discover that, the whole end of your existence is to achieve that stuff.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.940]   But today men are adrift.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.580]   Men are bored.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.100]   Men are going around in circles.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.860]   In fact, there was a headline in the United Kingdom paper just recently that young men
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:34.420]   between 16 to 29 years of age, 9 and 10, believe that their life lacks purpose.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:40.020]   What a waste of something so precious.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.860]   Passivity is an issue.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:51.540]   You realize passivity was Adam's first sin as he watched his wife sin?
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:57.060]   As we're reading Genesis 3, 6 to 7 the other day, when the woman saw the fruit of the tree
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.900]   was good for food and pleasing to the eye, desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.580]   and ate it.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:15.180]   She also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.600]   That's striking, isn't it?
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.420]   When the garden was faced with a threat, Adam did nothing.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.680]   When Eve was under spiritual attack, Adam just stood there like a bozo.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.020]   When Eve offered him fruit, Adam took the path of least resistance.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.860]   When God came into the garden to speak to him, Adam hid.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:43.860]   When God confronted him with what he did, Adam made up excuses and blamed Eve.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.980]   Talk about passivity.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:56.060]   And like Adam, many men today just stand there staring at life without being stirred, without
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.280]   engaging.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.640]   They watch life go by.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.120]   They watch the devil meddle in their life and family.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:12.160]   They watch opportunity fade and they watch life-defining moments happen without their
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.760]   input.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.000]   That's tragedy.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.560]   That's tragic and tragedy in and of itself.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.020]   I want to tell you something, guys.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.600]   The issue today is not domineering men.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   You hear this all the time.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:33.680]   "Well, you know, the issue is domineering, demanding men who are out of control."
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.240]   There are a few.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:42.160]   But the majority of men are not domineering, they're passive.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.760]   The issue today isn't that men are too strong, the issue today is men are too weak.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:54.920]   The issue today is not that men are doing too much, the issue today is that men are
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   doing too little.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.760]   Adam passively took the forbidden fruit from Eve's hand.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.520]   Noah, fresh off the ark and fresh into the sunlight of salvation, planted a vineyard,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.200]   made wine and passed out drunken, naked in his tent.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.880]   Abraham acquiesced to Sarah's plan for Hagar.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.800]   Isaac became known for his gullibility of character.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.880]   Jacob led into deception by his mother.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.040]   Esau traded his birthright for a bowl of stew.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.960]   Barak turned plain at the thought of battle.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.640]   Jonah set sail for Tarshish to avoid Nineveh.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.200]   David lounged on the roof while the other kings went out to war.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.600]   Israel settled for a fraction of its land.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.720]   Talk about passivity, indifference, lack of focus and force.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.880]   It's part of too many stories and you and I have got to make sure that part of that
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.520]   is not registered.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:04.200]   If you want to read about a life on fire, and a life marked by purpose and passion,
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:10.320]   read the life of George Whitefield, the New England revivalist.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.720]   What a life.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.080]   He was famous for saying, "I'd rather burn out than rust out."
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.520]   Whitefield preached from 40 to 60 hours a week.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.080]   In a lifetime he preached 18,000 sermons across 34 years.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.560]   He crossed the Atlantic between the UK and the US 13 times.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.380]   And it wasn't a 787 dreamliner.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.420]   His ministry among the American colonies was extensive.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.320]   He preached to thousands in the Great Britain.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.240]   He made three trips to Ireland and 14 to Scotland.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.040]   When you consider what he did and the volume of his work and the vigor he brought to it,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.640]   it's striking because he wasn't a man of great robust health.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:09.120]   He had severe spells of vomiting, but he arose every morning at 4 o'clock.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.560]   His record of ministry is amazing.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.280]   So amazing that he caught the eye and the imagination of Spurgeon who said this about
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.560]   George Whitefield, "Often as I have read his life, I am conscious of a distinct quickening.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.280]   Whenever I turn to it," love this phrase guys, "he lived.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:37.900]   Other men seemed of only half alive, but Whitefield was all life, fire, wing, force.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:43.000]   My own model, if I may have such a thing, in due subordination to my Lord as George
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.400]   Whitefield, but with unequal footsteps must I follow in his glorious track."
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:56.840]   In fact, George Whitefield said of himself, "I am never better than when I am on a little
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.480]   stretch for God."
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.280]   There's our word, to stretch after.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:10.760]   Men, get on and go on and get after what God has for them.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.600]   Guys, are you spinning your wheels?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.040]   Are you in neutral parked by the side of the road?
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.400]   Is life passing you by?
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.240]   Are defining moments now outside your reach because of passivity?
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.280]   The first thing we see about a man of God, the leader of the church, who is the measure
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.040]   of manhood within the church, I want you to see his wants.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.920]   Secondly, look at his work.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.800]   His wants, his work.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.240]   We're still in verse 1.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.740]   This is a faithful saying, "If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires," notice
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.960]   this, "a good work."
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.880]   That could be translated in your version, "a noble work" or "an excellent work."
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:41:01.600]   The Christian leader and the godly man are marked by good work, noble endeavor.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:10.820]   In the case of the elder, his primary work, which he should seek to excel in, is the teaching
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.840]   of Scripture.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:18.680]   Chapter 3, verse 2, "A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.640]   sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach."
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.200]   We'll see in a moment, the emphasis of this text is not on what the man does, but what
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.500]   the man is.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:35.320]   But in noticing what he does, primarily he is a disseminator of truth.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.400]   He is an expositor of Scripture.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:44.200]   In fact, when you get to chapter 5 and verse 17, "Let the elders who rule well be counted
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:51.000]   of double honor, especially those," notice, "who labor in word and doctrine."
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.860]   You go to 2 Timothy 2, verse 15, Paul writes a second time, "This young man and every church
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:07.440]   leader alongside him, he calls unto him approved of God, workmen in the word, who need not
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.360]   be ashamed."
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:16.520]   It's a shameful thing for a man to do shameful work.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.760]   You see his wants, you see his work.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:26.840]   In the work of exposition and pastoral counseling, this leader will be a non-ashamed workman
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   in the word.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.880]   I remember my first week at the Master's Seminary, Dr. Dick Mayhew addressed us as
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:41.040]   the incoming class, and he said this to us, "The greatest blasphemy is to take an inerrant
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.320]   Bible about a sinless Christ and mishandle it."
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   We were off to the races.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.600]   I knew what I was in for for the next four years.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:58.120]   They were going to challenge us, stretch us, cut no quarter as we sought to handle God's
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   Word.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.520]   I love that about the Master's Seminary.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   It's old school.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:09.320]   The standards are still high in biblical languages, historical theology, systematic theology,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:15.720]   leadership, church history, because God's church deserves the best of men, amen, who
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:22.760]   do good work, who see it as noble and seek to be noble in the doing of it.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:28.640]   Now, let's again be a little bit practical here.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.240]   Remember the elder, the pastor is the benchmark for biblical manhood, and while we're not
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.800]   all called to excel in the work of exposition, the elder is.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.880]   As a measure of a man, he at least challenges all men to be noble in their pursuit of work
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:50.300]   and to underscore the nobility of work.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:58.000]   We know that the creation mandate in Genesis 1, 25 to 28 was, and in chapter 2, verse 15
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.840]   was that man would exercise dominion over earth, not registered.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.280]   He would develop skills.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.280]   He would take what God had made and make something of it and bring dominion to the earth with
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.600]   the building of cities and the searing of families and the development of community.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.320]   Adam was told to stay in the garden and to tend it and to guard it.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.800]   Guys, this is some elementary stuff, but I just want to underscore it.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.720]   Men are not to be lazy.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.760]   If you're a man and you're lazy, hang your head in shame, because God created you in
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.880]   the image of His working self.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:47.160]   Remember what Jesus said, "My Father works and I work."
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.200]   We were created in the image of a working God.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:57.440]   I don't know about you, but as I've looked at God's handiwork, it seems pretty darn good.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.920]   Something beautiful about it.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.480]   The heavens declare His glory.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:08.640]   In fact, even when our Lord Jesus Christ was enfleshed for a period of His time, we assume
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:17.200]   He's a carpenter's son and He worked as a carpenter alongside Joseph.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:24.060]   We need to think about that and give some, you know, consideration to that.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.520]   Men are not to be underemployed.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.960]   Men are to exercise dominion within and over the creation.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.440]   Men are to create, farm, build, govern.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:41.760]   Proverbs 14:23, "There is profit in all work."
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.720]   I don't care if you brush the streets clean or you take a brush and you paint the masterpiece,
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.320]   it's all profit.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.800]   It all has its own nobility.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.240]   It has its own place.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.520]   It has its own good.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.800]   You and I are priests and we are to do excellent work.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.920]   "SWB Audio Capture, not registered."
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.880]   Last time, a little book by Tim Chalies, who's coming to our church, by the way, next year,
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.000]   God willing, run to win.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.760]   He said this, "Not only are we given new life, but with new life comes new purpose.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.020]   Let go of the ridiculous notion that your life is about you.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.360]   Let go of all the selfish purposes you once held onto.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.400]   Let go of the cultural wave of apathy and self-indulgence that is plaguing so many.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:37.560]   And once you have let go of all that might hinder you, grab onto a long life pursuit
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.560]   of Jesus.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.920]   Embrace your purpose.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.960]   Align every area of your life with it.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.400]   You are here to glorify God by abounding in good works."
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:54.280]   Guys, I don't know what you do, but I got a question.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.960]   According to the Bible, whatever you do, do you do it with all your might?
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.960]   Do you do it as unto the Lord?
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.040]   Are you a man pleaser?
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.560]   You work when the boss is looking?
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.520]   You work when it matters?
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.800]   You do what you need to do when it's to your best advantage?
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:21.600]   See, the true measure of a man is what he does when no one's looking.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   And when no one's looking, he understands he's still under the omniscient eye of God.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   Men must see the honor and nobility of work and do their work with excellence.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.800]   God has created us and redeemed us to be a people zealous of good works.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.760]   Titus 2 verse 14.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.020]   I love that part in the Nehemiah story.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.320]   You know, they're on the plains of Ono.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.800]   And those who have been plaguing Nehemiah plague him once more, and they've hatched
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.520]   this kind of plan of intrigue and deception.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:02.040]   And so they invite him to come down and to meet them on the plains.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:10.320]   And as Charles Spurgeon, Charles Wendall says, Nehemiah said, "Oh no, don't come down."
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.160]   What does he say in Nehemiah 6 verse 3?
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.740]   "I will not come down because I'm doing a great work."
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.280]   I love that perspective, don't you?
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:28.240]   You need to see whatever you do, small or great, that it is great in the eyes of God
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.780]   when it's dedicated to Him, when it provides for your family, and when it advances the
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.400]   good of society.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.620]   Excellence is what ought to mark you and me.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.120]   Whatever we do, do it with all our might.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.960]   Let me remind you of something very important.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.720]   Excellence is not being the best.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.800]   Excellence is doing your best.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.840]   That's what excellence is.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.480]   And the elder is called to an excellent work, a noble work.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.160]   And he does it with excellence as a workman that need not be ashamed.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.880]   And he trusts that that will be true of you and me.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:21.440]   Men produce, men provide, and men progress as it relates to work.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:29.120]   I was thinking about Joseph and his work in Egypt.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:34.800]   And in chapter 41 and verse 38, here's what we read.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.440]   This is Pharaoh's take on Joseph and his work.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   Pretty impressed.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:47.840]   "Pharaoh said to his servants, 'Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the Spirit
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.740]   of God is?'"
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.360]   That's a good job report right there.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.240]   There's a man standing out for God in Egypt amidst paganism.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.080]   And Pharaoh himself is struck, "Man, this guy's a cut above the rest in the way he acts,
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.560]   handles himself, and works."
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   Similar thing is said of Daniel.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.580]   "SWB Audio Capture, not registered."
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:20.360]   Chapter 6 and verse 4, here's what we read.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.800]   Or 3, again, King Darius says this about Daniel.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and the sand traps because an excellent spirit
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:42.960]   was in him, and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.280]   Daniel did noble work, and nobles took note of it.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:56.960]   Guys, don't need to say anything more other than I trust you see the nobility of work
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.240]   and that you give yourself to do noble work.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.480]   That's what men do.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:11.560]   They work hard, they work well, and they distinguish themselves above others in terms of punctuality,
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:17.200]   product, commitment, team play.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.160]   I just finished a really good book called "Called to Create."
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.440]   And in it, the story is told that we're in the mid-1990s.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:30.680]   Chick-fil-A is facing its first real threat from another quick service chicken company.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:36.600]   It was a startup called Boston Chicken that ultimately became known as Boston Market.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.240]   It was growing gangbusters.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.720]   It was founded in 1995.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:48.640]   It grew so fast that they had plans to grow even faster to reach $1 billion in sales by
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.320]   the year 2000.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.720]   Sales numbers that Chick-fil-A had never seen or reached.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.960]   And so, it threw some of the executives in Chick-fil-A into a bit of a tailspin.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.680]   And they started, you know, thinking through, "Hi, we match this.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.960]   How do we become bigger?
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.600]   How do we grow faster?"
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.320]   And that dominated the conversation in the boardroom.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:16.520]   And some plans were drawn up and eventually, they gave us a place where they called in
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   Kathy Truitt.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.240]   And they were going to have this discussion.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:24.720]   And they went on about the competition and the accelerated growth they were seeing.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.180]   And if they don't do something about this, we'll be overtaken and lost market share.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:34.320]   And in the middle of all of this, Truitt, Kathy had enough.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   He stops the conversation.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:43.360]   Here's what he says, "I'm sick and tired of hearing you talk about us getting bigger.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.440]   What we need to be talking about is getting better.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.400]   If we get better, our customers will demand that we get bigger."
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.800]   It's not a good little insight in life.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   Not quantity, quality.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.520]   It's quality that produces quantity.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   Get better.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   And the customer will demand you get bigger.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:12.440]   Guys, get better at what you do for the glory of God.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.160]   His want, His work, His walk.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.520]   This is verses 2 and 2 to 3.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.540]   The Christian leader and the godly man are marked by Christian character and godliness
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.540]   of life.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:30.600]   Listen, desire and aspiration is not enough, as important as it is.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.480]   Silence in work is not enough, as important as it is.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:41.320]   Genuineness of life is of first importance.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:50.280]   Because behind and beneath all that this man desires and does, there must be a sterling
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.560]   character, a quality life.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.280]   And that's where we're at in verses 2 to 3.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:03.920]   You'll notice in verses 2 to 3 that the emphasis on the tax is on what he is, not what he does.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:10.280]   The only thing we're told he must do is he must be able to teach.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.320]   But the emphasis on this is what he must be.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:23.120]   Because what you are, everything you do.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   So what you are is far more important than what you do.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.760]   And when what you are is right, what you do will be right.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:37.440]   The emphasis on the tax is not on methods, but man.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.040]   Not on competence, but character.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.360]   In God's book, character trumps charisma and charismata.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:52.680]   The emphasis of this tax is on spiritual graces, not spiritual gifts.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   E.M.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.320]   Bynes said this, "Conduct is what we do.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.880]   Character is what we are.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.440]   Conduct is the outward life.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:06.280]   Character is the life unseen, hidden within, yet evidenced by that which will be seen.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.760]   Conduct is external, seen from without.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.840]   Character is internal, operating within.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.920]   In the economy of grace, conduct is the offspring of character.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.840]   Character is the state of the heart.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.980]   Conduct is the outward expression.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.000]   Character is the root of the tree.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.720]   Conduct is the fruit of the root."
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.440]   I remember some years ago when I was pastoring in Ohio, I was struggling a little.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.080]   I wasn't in a good place mentally about the ministry.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.240]   I was wondering if God had something else for me, and I called up my mentor in Belfast,
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:44.040]   Pastor Freddie McLachlan, and I began to share this, and I expected him to lend me a shoulder
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.480]   to kind of cry on.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:52.200]   But by the end of the conversation, Freddie kind of had sized it, and he challenged me
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   with these words.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.920]   He says, "Philip, I don't know what God has for you next.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.180]   Maybe He has something for you beyond where you're at.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.120]   But I want to tell you this, God is far more important, God is far more interested in what
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:12.320]   you're becoming than in where you're going."
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.920]   That was really challenging.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.120]   God's very interested in, guys, in what you're becoming.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.320]   Are you becoming like…
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.480]   "SWB Audio Capture, Not Registered."
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.520]   Are you becoming filled by the Spirit?
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.200]   You becoming man of the Word?
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.880]   Are you becoming leaders?
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.720]   Time won't allow us to go through all of these traits.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   Temperate, verse 2, not clouded with wine.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.200]   It's tied to not given with wine in verse 3.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.280]   He was used figuratively of someone sober-minded and clear-headed.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:55.400]   In fact, in chapter 4 of the second letter, verse 5, Paul will tell Timothy that he needs
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.240]   to be the kind of person who keeps his head in all situations.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:07.080]   So that's our word, temperate, level-headed, clear-thinking.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:14.200]   The Christian leader and the man of God is not, you know, found in a panic.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.560]   He's not rash.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.640]   He's not excitable.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.200]   He's not flippant.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.760]   He keeps the main things, the plain things.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:27.300]   He's also sober-minded, you'll notice next in verse 2, which means disciplined, self-controlled.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.680]   He stays on target.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.960]   He stays on task.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:36.040]   He properly orders his priorities.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:41.880]   Robert Yarborough, in a commentary on the pastoral epistle, says that pastoral leaders
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:48.040]   should know their own minds and not be flighty or unstable.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.080]   He's of good behavior.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.720]   This is the Greek word kosmos.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:56.680]   It's tied into God's created order, the beauty of His handiwork.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.520]   It speaks about the beauty and the balance of nature.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:06.600]   In fact, it's used in 1 Timothy 2, 8 to speak of the modest dress that's expected of a godly
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.240]   woman.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:15.360]   So it speaks of orderly behavior, decorum, dignity.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.160]   That's what marks a man of God.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.920]   He has behavior suited to the occasion.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.120]   He doesn't come to a funeral dressed in a lion's coat.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.160]   I just needed to get that off my chest.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.960]   Orderly and organized.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.000]   There's decorum, there's dignity.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.440]   Maybe I'm old school, but I was trained by old school men and I'm thankful for it.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:47.520]   When I was at the Irish Baptist College in Belfast, Dr. Ivor Oakley, an educated PhD
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.680]   from Oxford said to us, "Men, never come to the door in your slippers."
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:59.120]   I'm not sure where he got that in the pastoral epistles, but the simple point was, be men
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.560]   of dignity.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:06.840]   As men of God, understand the highness of your calling and let that be reflected in
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.520]   just how you handle yourself.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.680]   Hospitable?
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:17.960]   Hospitable, that would mean that he certainly doesn't live in a monastery and he doesn't
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.440]   live the life of a hermit.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.120]   He lives on Main Street.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.920]   And more than likely, he's married and therefore his home is an outpost of the kingdom and
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.800]   the door is open.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.880]   This word means love of stranger.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:38.480]   It means the man of God has got good people skills.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:46.000]   The man of God hasn't found a person he won't seek to love and like.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.960]   He's interesting.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.880]   He's engaging.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   He's other-centered.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:59.400]   Not given the wine, literally means doesn't sit alongside wine.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.920]   It's certainly a prohibition against drunkenness.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.600]   It's not a prohibition against drinking wine, but it may be a prohibition against sitting
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:17.080]   in bars and sitting among people who linger long at wine because nothing good eventually
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.280]   comes of that.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.920]   However, literally he doesn't sit alongside wine.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:31.960]   He's not something he owns for his love of alcohol or his drinking habits.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:39.600]   And if he enjoys that liberty, which I think he may well, he doesn't flaunt it.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.760]   And he exercises that liberty with great judicious application.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.840]   Not violent.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.000]   We could add that to the former thought and say the pastor's never to be an angry drunk.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.200]   In fact, this word means to blow, to strike a blow.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.900]   Simply, I haven't encountered this ever.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.600]   Maybe you have, but this is a prohibition.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:11.200]   A pastor never comes to blows with anybody in a disagreement or a conflict.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.720]   The pastor never says, "I'll see you out in the car park after the prayer meeting."
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.600]   All right, senators can do that, but pastors can't do that.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.800]   Okay, so not greedy for money or covetous.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.760]   Not greedy for money or covetous.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.120]   Watching my time here, it's flying.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.480]   He's not in the ministry for financial gain.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.180]   You read about that in 1 Peter 5.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:41.440]   His reason for serving is God's glory, not money.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.060]   He's not a harling.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.380]   You can't buy him.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.960]   You can't buy his favor, and you can't buy his silence by what you're willing to give
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.380]   him.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.400]   And he doesn't favor the rich.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.840]   If necessary, like Paul, he'll even work with his own hands because he won't want to seek
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.880]   covet another man's silver.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.040]   Gentle not quarrelsome.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.200]   Those are two attributes I've put together.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.620]   They're, you know, two sides of the coin.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.740]   Sweet reasonableness is a good way to understand that.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:24.780]   In his conduct and in his conversation, an elder is a reasonable man.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.860]   He's patient, forbearing.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.860]   He makes allowances.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:37.740]   He's armed with the truth for sure, but he doesn't go gunning for a fight.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.640]   His reproofs are measured.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:47.060]   His arguments are not pugnacious, and he's not defined by a bickering spirit.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.340]   I love the story John MacArthur told us at Samanie one day.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.380]   You know, John's known to be somewhat of a controversial figure.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.660]   He writes books that are kind of on the cutting edge of controversy and disagreements within
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.660]   the church.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.860]   He was unafraid when he dealt with the issue of the charismatic movement, and he's not
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.140]   unafraid in dealing with the role of men and women and so on and so forth.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.240]   And believe it or not, given all of that, he had a friendship for a time with Jack Hayford,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.620]   who was just around the corner from him.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:20.360]   And here's John the cessationist and Jack Hayford the Pentecostal.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.560]   And one year they were at the NRB, the National Radio Broadcasters Convention, and he's walking
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.420]   with Jack Hayford, and a bunch of four square pastors are coming up the middle aisle, and
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.900]   they can see Jack Hayford with John MacArthur, and Jack Hayford can see it's going to be
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:41.700]   awkward because it's MacArthur, the charismatic's nemesis.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.200]   And they bump into each other, and Jack Hayford says this.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.100]   He took all the tension out of the moment.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.540]   He said, "This is John MacArthur, my friend, who's much nicer in person than he is in his
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.540]   books."
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.540]   And that's good.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.260]   And if any of you know John, and I do, he's a gentleman.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.060]   Interesting.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.700]   He's not quarrelsome by nature.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.360]   He's armed with the truth.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.340]   He's unbending in his commitment to it, but there's a nice spirit and demeanor about him.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:19.380]   Now, I should move on, but I want to just come back and double down on those early attributes
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:25.780]   for a moment and touch on an area I think men are certainly misfiring in and haven't
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.300]   gotten into gear.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:33.660]   You'll notice those first attributes of temperate and sober-minded, unclouded, self-controlling
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.740]   people, shouldn't have fun.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:39.180]   Guys, my point is this.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.820]   Men of God, the pastor, and he's the measure of a man within the congregation.
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:54.500]   Those kind of men are serious, steadfast, self-controlled.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.780]   They are responsible men.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:03.620]   See, the measure of a man is he takes his responsibilities seriously.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.500]   Whether that's work, home, play, friends, church.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.820]   But most men are not serious.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.820]   Most men are flippant, indifferent.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.740]   We've got perpetual adolescence among our young men.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:27.300]   Most men are coming late to life, late to sanctification, late to marriage, late to
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.420]   church.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.700]   Too many Peters or Peter Pans.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:37.620]   They've never grown up and taken responsibility.
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.980]   Too many men want life on the cheap.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.780]   What a shame.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:47.940]   There's a frightening weightlessness to God, to the things of God, to the issues of death
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:53.060]   and eternity with too many men.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.340]   They are more silly than they're serious.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.300]   Believe me, I love having a good time.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.060]   I can laugh as hard as the next guy.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.540]   But there comes a point, guys, in our conversation when we hang out with each other, that passes
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.800]   and we get on to life and the kingdom of God and the state of our country and what we need
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.620]   to do to make things better.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:20.260]   Because men take responsibility for what's going on in them and around them and beyond
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.960]   them.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.240]   But too many men are silly, not serious.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.980]   Too many men are playful, not prudent.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:32.420]   I hope you'll be challenged by that.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.340]   Matthew Henry the Puritan tells the story of a great statesman.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:42.580]   And the administration of Queen Elizabeth the First, who retired from public life in
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:48.420]   his latter days and gave himself to serious thought and serious study.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.700]   His former married companions visited him and they kin of scolded him and they chastised
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   him for becoming somber and sober.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:05.140]   He said, "I don't think I'm somber, but I do think I'm sober."
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:11.980]   Because there is a translation in 1 Timothy 3 that the elder is sober, serious minded.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:16.180]   He wanted to say this to his friends.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:20.700]   I am serious, for everyone around me is serious.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.300]   God is serious in observing us.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.540]   Christ is serious in interceding for us.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.260]   The Spirit is serious in striving with us.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.220]   The truths of God are serious.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.740]   Our spiritual enemies are serious in their endeavors to ruin us.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.780]   Poor lost sinners are serious in hell.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.060]   And why then should I not be serious too?
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.380]   It's a good word.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.380]   Let's move on.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:51.580]   We're going to start collapsing some things here given where we're at in terms of time.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:08:00.100]   I want you to see his wife, his wants, his work, his walk, his wife.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.900]   I won't spend a ton of time here.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:06.820]   Mike kind of covered some of this on the call for you and I to disciple our children, but
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:11.540]   you'll notice that the Christian leader and the godly man are marked by a vibrant and
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.620]   virtuous home life.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:19.660]   Look at verse 2, "A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife."
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.500]   Look at verses 4 and 5, "He is one who rules his own house well, having his children in
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.460]   submission with all reverence.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.100]   For if a man does not know how to rule his own house well, how will he take care of the
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.900]   church of God?"
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:40.260]   The Christian leader and the godly man are marked by vibrant, virtuous home life.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.860]   Let me audio capture, not registered.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:48.300]   "The pastor and the men that look to the pastor as the measure of a man, their lives are marked
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.700]   by vibrant, virtuous home lives.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.700]   Things aren't crumbling on the home front.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:09:00.980]   The marriage hasn't seen better days and the children aren't running crazy out on the streets
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.540]   bringing shame and disgrace to the family name.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:11.100]   No, the man of God is a devoted husband and he's a diligent father."
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:16.540]   Marriage is not a qualification for ministry, but the married minister must meet certain
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.540]   qualifications.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:26.740]   Although I would say this, marriage is preferred in terms of the pastor or the church leader
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.180]   because of the creation mandate.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:35.580]   You know, leave your mother and father and cleave to your wife and be fruitful and exercise
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.300]   dominion.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:42.020]   What about the value of the help of a godly wife in ministry and life?
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.660]   What about protection from sexual sin within marriage?
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.860]   What about the producing of disciples, your own children?
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.100]   What about building trust in the eyes of the congregation as they look at you and see that
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.700]   you run your home well?
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:01.100]   Your wife is in submission and your children respect you and that gives them a sense that
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:07.980]   this is a good man and a good leader with a tried and trusted record.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:14.140]   Paul here argues that the man of God should take care of his own house because that will
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.180]   be an index on the high he's going to take care of the household of God.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.180]   I'm not going to get into this.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.180]   He will love his wife intently and faithfully.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:26.660]   He will lead and manage his home well.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.860]   He will wear the pants in the home.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.720]   He will not be a stay-at-home dad.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.660]   He will lead, he will provide, he will protect.
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.060]   He will set the tone for the family.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.460]   He will set the direction.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.220]   He will be the cultural Sherpa for his wife and children.
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.860]   He will lead the family devotions.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:52.140]   He will pray for them and over them and as a parent he'll be effective.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.720]   I don't, I'm not, I've never been convinced that an elder must have believing children,
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.820]   but I've always been convinced that an elder, a church leader, ought to have children that
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.300]   respect him.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:13.940]   That he is, the children know that dad loves and that when he's tough it's tough love and
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.300]   he's measured and he's consistent.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.780]   He's humble when he's done wrong and apologized.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:27.740]   He works hard and provides, he helps him to transition through the different, you know,
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:33.900]   hoops in life and any child that grows up in that kind of environment for the most part
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.500]   will respect that.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:43.780]   Before I leave this thought, the one I'll just touch on is this one in verse two.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.980]   He's the husband of one wife.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:50.980]   Maybe a prohibition against polygamy, it may be a prohibition against a man who's been
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:12:01.420]   divorced and remarried, but I think more than that, the literal Greek is a one woman man.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:09.340]   The pastor and the men who measure themselves against him are men who are sexually pure
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.940]   and committed to heterosexual marriage.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:20.120]   They see marriage as a protection against sexual sin and therefore they protect their
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.620]   marriage in the sweetness of intimacy with their wife.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:30.980]   They want their bed to be undefiled, Hebrews 13.4.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.500]   That's a challenge in today's pornographic culture.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.300]   I wrote down a few things last night to myself.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:41.820]   I don't have time to develop these, but here they are.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:47.780]   If you want to be a one woman man, guard your eyes, make a covenant with your eyes and your
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.900]   soul, not look on the other side of the window.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:13:00.300]   Monitor your social interactions with the opposite sex, words, environments, prioritize
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.580]   and protect your own sex life.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.100]   Let your own wife's breasts satisfy you.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:14.060]   1 Corinthians 7, 1-5 tells us it ought to be meaningful and a regular part of life.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.580]   Treasure your wife's godliness because as we enjoy our wife physically and we're attracted
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:24.460]   and aroused by her physically, there'll come a point where indeed age will take its toll
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.300]   on both you and her.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.300]   According to Proverbs 31, you know what?
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:39.220]   Beauty is fading and charm is fleeting, but a woman that fears the Lord is to be treasured.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:44.220]   And as you get older in life, guys, both you and your wife lose some of that physical fervor
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.100]   and beauty and all of that.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:54.380]   Appreciate your wife for her godliness, her faithfulness, her lifetime of service to you.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:14:01.300]   Why in the world would you take a dagger and stick it in her heart?
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:06.820]   And love and fear God most.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:15.020]   A little white ermine is an animal in middle Europe known for its spotless white coat.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.160]   It's hunted, it's been hunted for many, many centuries.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:25.180]   It was beloved of kings and queens for its pure white fur.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:31.420]   The interesting thing about it is it didn't like to get its coat soiled and hunters knew
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.420]   this.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:35.780]   They were well acquainted with this fact.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.460]   And so what they would do is they find out its nest or its lair, its hole, and they would
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:46.240]   daub it with filth and dirt around the entrance to its home and then they would go out looking
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.220]   for the ermine, they would set the dogs loose and the little ermine would be at home for
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.140]   safety.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:57.060]   But when it got to the hole, it never went into it.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.740]   It did not want to get its white fur soiled or spoiled and it literally turned around
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:06.080]   and faced the bloodthirsty baying dogs.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.860]   It would rather die than stand its white fur.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:21.220]   Oh, that God would give you and me that kind of commitment to purity.
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:26.460]   His words, I'm not going to get into this too much because I want to camp on one other
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.980]   idea here and wrap it up.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:34.980]   His words, the Christian leader and the godly man are marked by a knowledge of the Word
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.300]   and a passion to share it with others.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.140]   See the elder is a man who's able to teach.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:49.540]   He's a swordsman, he's a scholar, he handles the Word of God well.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:54.100]   To use the words of Spurgeon regarding John Bunyan, "His blood is bibline.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.220]   If you cut him, he bleeds the Bible."
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:03.380]   Now that's true of an elder, able to teach, speaks of competency in theology, speaks of
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:10.580]   skill in communicating the Christian faith and an adeptness to indeed touch people's
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:13.060]   lives by that.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:18.840]   He will excel in that, labor in that according to 1 Timothy 5.17.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:24.660]   But what's true of him in particular still got to be true of all man.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:31.540]   Guys, I hope that you will receive God's Word like the Thessalonians.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.140]   In 1 Thessalonians 2.13, it says that they received the Word of God not as the Word of
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.460]   men but as it truly is, the Word of God.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.520]   I hope you've got a clear and compelling bibliology.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:48.740]   This is the inerrant, inspired, authoritative, sufficient, eternal Word of God for all time
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.420]   and all cultures, all men, all women.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.420]   And you know what?
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   It's the final rule for all daughters and sons of men.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:59.060]   It's how you understand the Bible.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.260]   You receive God's Word like the Thessalonians.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:08.820]   You feed on God's Word like Job where he esteemed and treasured the Word of God more than his
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:13.400]   necessary food, Job 23, 8 to 12.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.940]   You obey God's Word fully like Caleb, Numbers 14.24, "But my servant Caleb, because he has
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:24.980]   had a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land which he
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.180]   entered and his descendants shall take possession of it."
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:35.180]   And we need to honor God's Word like Ezra's flock, Nehemiah 8, 4 to 6, "When the Word
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.820]   of God was brought, the people of God stood."
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.380]   We have made that a tradition here at Kenwood on a sunny morning when we get to the point
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:47.820]   where I'm going to read the text of Scripture, I'm about to preach.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.780]   Most Sundays we ask people to stand, not because we worship the Bible, but we worship the God
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:58.480]   who wrote it and we honor the treasure that it is and the life that it gives and the wisdom
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480]   that it imports.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:04.460]   All right, I'm just going to fit in one more and we're done.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.500]   His witness, his witness.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:17.220]   Look at verse 7, "Moreover, he must have a good testimony among those who are outside,
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.820]   lest he fall into reproach in the snare of the devil."
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:26.420]   The Christian leader and the godly man are marked by an impeachable life and a sterling
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:31.540]   reputation inside, notice, and outside the church.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:39.140]   Write down Ecclesiastes 7, 1, "A good name is better than ointment."
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:46.420]   You know, a nice cologne or perfume, you smell it, it's enjoyable, it's attractive, but then
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.140]   it's gone.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:53.900]   When the person moves beyond your presence or you move out of their location, it's gone.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:59.700]   But a good name is lasting.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:04.200]   The word blameless here in verse 2 doesn't mean without sin.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.860]   It means that no shame or scandal is attached to the leader's life, no flagrant sin.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:14.100]   In fact, literally it means not able to be held.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:21.100]   That means that scandal, accusation, sin can't be attached to that man.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:26.540]   It's not that he's sinless, but in the general scheme of things, there's no flagrant sin,
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:31.500]   there's no black mark that can be attached to him.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.340]   Alistair Begg calls him the Teflon man, nothing sticks.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.820]   It's a good insight.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.740]   And then a good testimony with those who are outside.
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:46.660]   The word testimony here gives us our English word martyr, means witness, pays witness to
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:53.820]   or testimony to, speaks to the fact that people in the community will witness the leader's
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.820]   life up close and personal.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:01.660]   They may even be the recipient of his hospitality, or they see his children, or they encounter
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:06.780]   his wife, and they see as he lives among the people, he's not in a monastery, he's on Main
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.700]   Street, he's got a zip code.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.700]   And you know what?
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:15.820]   His marriage is strong, his wife seems happy, his children are fun, but very obedient, very
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:21.180]   respectful, and when you're in his home, you get treated like royalty.
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:25.860]   And if he's bivocational, which could be the case in a New Testament elder, he's got a
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.620]   good reputation at work.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:36.060]   People are impressed by his moral integrity, love of neighbor, general goodness, selflessness.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.260]   He's a shining example.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:44.100]   Guys, as we close, what's your testimony like in the community?
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:53.020]   If I was to go to the factory floor, to the office, or go to your neighbor, wrap the door,
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.740]   "Hey, tell me about Joe.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   Tell me about John."
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.220]   Would I get a ringing response?
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:06.260]   Would it be easy for you to talk about your goodness and your generosity and your grace?
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:15.420]   A good name is important, guys, because remember, to our name is attached his name.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:20.100]   And we got to have a good reputation so that, "Hey, you may be glorified."
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:26.820]   My mother used to say to me, "Even when I was unsaved, I lived in a pretty tough neighborhood
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.860]   in North Belfast."
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.300]   My mom was aware of that.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.940]   She wasn't sure what I was going to get into.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:39.700]   And as I went out the door, she'd always say to me as I left the home, "Whether saved or
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:47.660]   unsaved, you remember what house you come from and whose name you bear."
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:54.260]   My father was a Baptist deacon and a respected man in his community.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.460]   He'll be here in a couple of weeks.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.820]   He's lived in the same house for 60 years.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:04.820]   He left school when he was 14, worked in a factory his whole life.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:10.060]   Literally took a day off, brought the bacon home, played soccer with me and the boys on
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:14.580]   a Saturday night, man's man.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:20.140]   Left school at 14, a few years ago, his borough of 100,000 people made him the Lord Mayor.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:26.620]   And when he retired, there wasn't anybody on either side of the political aisle that
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:30.740]   didn't respect Billy DeCoursey.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:36.740]   I was home a few years ago, taking a bus into Belfast, down into the bus stop, engaged a
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.780]   conversation with this woman, told her my story.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   I'm home, seeing my mom and dad.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:44.660]   I live in America, come from California, all very interesting.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:48.220]   She said, "Yeah, I'm staying with mom and dad up in Linford Green there, Billy and Betty
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.220]   DeCoursey."
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:54.780]   "Oh, you're Billy's son.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.820]   Your dad's a good man."
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.060]   That's what she said.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.420]   That's not a bad epitaph, guys.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:07.100]   SWB audio capture, not registered.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.820]   He loved God and he loved his neighbor.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.220]   Father, we thank you for our time in the Word.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.980]   We have imbibed much truth today from the Scripture.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:25.580]   We pray that it may be as sweet as honey to our taste and as precious as silver to our
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.260]   estimation.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:34.580]   Lord, we live in a day when we're told that there is no measure of manhood.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.020]   It's fluid.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.300]   It's transcendental.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:44.100]   It's however you define it or however you identify it.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.000]   Lord, we reject that.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.820]   Your Word is forever settled in heaven.
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:54.860]   You've made us in your image, male and female, and you have a certain plan and purpose for
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.740]   us as men.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:03.620]   Lord, we repent and ask for your grace in the fact that we're not measuring up as men.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.740]   We're feeling.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.780]   Feeling our wives, our daughters, our sons, our communities.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:14.140]   Lord, help us to measure up.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:17.020]   Pray for every elder and pastor here today.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:25.740]   May they lift the mantle of church leadership ever so slowly and feel its weight, because
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.500]   as the man of God, they are the measure for every man of God.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:34.760]   Lord, make us aspirational.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.260]   Help us to pursue your will and bend in that direction.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.260]   Help us to do noble work and see work as noble.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:45.820]   Help us to be men of character.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:52.860]   For what we are on the inside is better and bigger than what we are on the outside.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.500]   Help us to love our wives.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.260]   Be faithful, sexually.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.820]   Be generous to them, kind to them.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.340]   Estimate their worth properly.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:04.820]   Help us to love our children.

[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.660]   Life will be that our children walk in the truth.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:15.620]   Speak as men of the word.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:21.460]   And help our neighbors and our workmates to love Jesus more because they see him greatly
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.500]   in us.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.940]   For Jesus' sake.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:24.940]   Amen.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:27.180]   Okay, Todd, you're up.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.940]   All right.
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:31.500]   Thanks, Philip.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:37.140]   Well, that rounds out the three sessions.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   What a great job.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.140]   Philip, thanks so much.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.320]   One more round of applause for Philip, please.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   Great stuff.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320]   So actionable.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.940]   So many things to think about.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.540]   Hopefully, all of you will take away a lot from this day and you'll remember all that
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.540]   was said.
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.540]   You took good notes.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:55.500]   You have two great books to read and a great Bible study to review.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.700]   So I would encourage you to read both of those books, though.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:01.020]   The War on Men and Raising Men, Not Boys.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.820]   You'll see that what you heard today was just the appetizer.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   There's so much more.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.820]   So we're going to go ahead and redo this stage quickly.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.860]   We're going to do a quick Q&A with all the guys that were here, the speakers.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.100]   So this shouldn't take long.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.860]   I'm going to ask you not to necessarily—if you can stay in the tent, that's best.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.980]   It won't be a super long session.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:24.900]   And I know if we leave, it will be a long time before we all get back again.
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.240]   I'm speaking from experience.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.220]   So hang with us for just a little bit and we will have this Q&A session kicked off.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:39.220]   Joining us for this is another of our pastors here from Kindred, Andrew Rogers, who runs
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:44.140]   our counseling ministry here, amongst many other things.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.020]   And he'll be our moderator for this quick Q&A.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.100]   So anyhow, we'll bring him up in just a moment.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.340]   So sit tight, stretch, and we'll be right with you.
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:27:08.740]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.660]   All right.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:15.860]   Good afternoon, everybody.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.420]   Well, we have a few questions.
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:25.620]   I think to kick it off is simply this, if you cook and eat bacon, is that manly?
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.100]   - Not the cooking part, but the eating of it's manly.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.300]   - What if it's turkey bacon?
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:37.620]   - Yeah, I eat turkey bacon, so I got to say it's manly or else I'm not manly, so yeah.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.380]   - Owen disagrees.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.620]   - No, turkey bacon is not manly.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:42.620]   - OK.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.620]   - OK.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.100]   - We just need to get that out of the way.
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.100]   - It's not bacon.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.100]   There you go.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.100]   - All right.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:55.340]   Well, seriously, some of the questions that have come in, here's one, what role does the
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:00.420]   church have in developing men within our present society?
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:07.980]   What specific ways can we develop biblical men in our church and in our home?
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:08.980]   So the role and the specific ways.
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:12.380]   - I'll kick that off with one way just to make it easy for myself and piggyback off
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.940]   my message.
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:20.300]   I think one of the primary ways that you guys can promote and accelerate and develop a culture
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.820]   of biblical manhood in the church, which is necessary because we can't control the culture.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:30.620]   We hope to influence it and salt it, but men will wax worse and worse.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:38.460]   My eschatology informs me that society will rumble from one mistake to another mistake
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.740]   and even get worse as we bump up against Jesus' return.
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:46.380]   But the church is the counterculture and outpost of God's kingdom.
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:51.540]   And as I took my model, I think one of the best ways a church can develop biblical manhood
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:56.780]   is to make sure that we protect and promote men in leadership.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:02.140]   I think that's the biblical model we're complementarian here at Kindred, men only as pastors.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:07.500]   I could make an argument for women deaconesses, but at our church, it's men.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:14.260]   So when someone comes to Kindred, at the most basic level, they're encountering godly men,
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:21.140]   strong men, biblical men, men who are unafraid to be men in the life of the church.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:23.940]   And that's why we have found a good balance in our church.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.620]   I've been to Mike's church.
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:26.820]   It's the same.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:29.260]   We are not a women-driven church.
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:31.720]   We are not a women-dominated church.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:37.180]   We have a growing culture of men in our church because they see it from the top down.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:44.020]   So for me, one of the… the primary way is if everything, you know, if leadership runs
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.900]   downhill and influence runs downhill, I think the best way is to make sure that your church
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:56.460]   is governed by qualified biblical men in leadership, and that sets the temperature and the tone
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:33:00.360]   for the rest of the church.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   Any other words, guys?
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.940]   - No, I think in terms of society, you're right.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.420]   We don't control society, but I think the church certainly affects society, even on
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:16.500]   an individual case-by-case man standing up in an office, being strong, setting the pace.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:23.560]   I've watched, I've been a part of a secular classroom where just one Christian standing
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.900]   up for what is right.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.780]   You find out other people who didn't have the courage to stand up.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.580]   Others have stood up with him.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:36.900]   I remember myself in college at a secular college, just being able to state what is
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:42.220]   right to take a leadership role and watch other people come out of the shadows and do
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.220]   the same.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:46.220]   So, you know, in workplaces, you think about all the workplaces that are represented by
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:51.500]   the thousands of men representing our churches, if they really take their job seriously and
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:56.460]   reflect masculinity in a proper biblical way, that is contagious.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:00.540]   And I think people start to step up to that standard.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.900]   I love what these brothers have said.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:08.820]   I would just say, yeah, a church that is warm, these two men are both convictional pastors,
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:11.140]   but they're also warm pastors.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.460]   They're genuine shepherds.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:20.620]   And so a church that has warm men, not cold men, not men who make you feel weird or unwanted
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.920]   or those kind of things.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:27.980]   But I think what warm men do, whether they are a pastor or not, whether they ever serve
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:34.260]   in ministry or not, but in a church, they spread a culture of discipleship, not by virtue
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:40.580]   of necessarily one program or another, but just by virtue of caring about men and women
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:46.020]   alike, but in terms of manhood and raising up the next generation, training disciples.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.300]   And that's really what's missing from our society.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:55.260]   Our society has no even secular form of discipleship, if you will, but it especially needs Christian
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260]   discipleship.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.500]   And here's an encouraging word in the midst of a lot of darkness.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.580]   The market is wide open.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:07.660]   Lots of young men have no one speaking into their life in a good way, no one training
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.860]   them, no father in the home.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:15.740]   So here is an incredible, brothers, an incredible evangelistic and missional moment for the
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:18.380]   church to reach out to young men.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:26.100]   We just saw that recently here at Kindred where we baptized a Jewish guy who's the
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:34.060]   lead psychologist in Orange County who determines in most murder cases or cases of that level
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.580]   whether the person who's claiming insanity is insane.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.460]   He's been married to a Christian woman for many, many years and just recently got saved
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:48.160]   and we baptized him and he talked about it in the baptismal testimony that what he loved
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.100]   about this was a culture of men.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:55.380]   He came to a church where he didn't feel awkward in his, you know, masculinity.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.500]   Men were warm.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:01.740]   We talked life, we talked family, we talked sports, we talked politics, we talked Christ.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.820]   He started going to our men's breakfast, started going to a small group and the men in that
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.860]   small group again loved on him.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.540]   They didn't come across as weird.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:16.660]   They came across as men with their lives together, moving and interaction, things that appealed
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.500]   to him innately as a man, which Mike is talking about, and then, but he saw in our case it
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:27.660]   was Christ driving it and Christ defining it and, you know, we find here at Kenwood,
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:34.180]   I'm sure it's the same elsewhere like Compass, the women of this church love the fact that
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:39.700]   we're led by unashamed men because they find that attractive for their own men and they're
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:47.060]   not frightened to bring their men to church because again, they know from just interacting
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:52.260]   with our guys, their men are not going to feel awkward.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:56.020]   And I would just add to that, if your church, and there's certain things obviously that
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:00.340]   are reserved biblically for men, but there are other areas that you could go either way
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:06.660]   and yet to put men in those positions, whether it's ushering or parking lot or, you know,
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.260]   emceeing or reading scripture, whatever it is, you could make a case where does this
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.020]   have to be a man, but when it is a man, right?
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:18.180]   I think the men not only respond better to that in the congregation, but the women, as
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:23.700]   you said, particularly regenerate women, that's a strong, safe place.
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:24.700]   It's something that they choose.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:25.700]   - SWB audio capture not registered.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:31.260]   - If you feminize your church, you'll win some blue-haired women that'll like that,
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:32.260]   right?
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:35.260]   But you masculinize, you make a more masculine church, right?
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:40.020]   You're going to win not only men, but you'll win a lot of the women too.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:47.620]   The word toxic, you're not going to find it in the concordance, by the way.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:52.460]   It's a word that's been created by secular world.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:57.540]   It's thrown around a lot, and like with many terms, people throw it around without actually
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.540]   knowing what it means.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:04.780]   Matter of fact, one of the definitions is you're in a relationship where you give more
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:07.660]   than you get.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.900]   So that's pretty much all of Christians.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.500]   So that's just how loose this definition is, but it's getting thrown around a lot.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.660]   And so one of the questions is why do you think the culture always likes to attach the
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.620]   word toxic to the word masculinity?
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:29.620]   - Well, I mean, theologically, men love darkness more than light.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:37.460]   And so just in a general scheme of things, the man is such a defined and important role
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:46.980]   in creation and then within the church that those who love darkness don't like the exposure
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.420]   of true masculinity, and so they will attack it.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:52.900]   And then I think Owen talked on it.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:53.900]   It's a worldview issue.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:59.060]   I mean, there are worldviews from feminism to Marxism that are being unleashed in our
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:05.540]   society and to achieve their ends, they've got the steamroller and flattened men.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:12.500]   And so whether it's toxic, it's just a pejorative term they use to attack that which exposes
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:19.360]   them, that which opposes them, that which gets in their evil way and, you know, fights
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.500]   against God's rule within society.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.180]   - Yeah, well said.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:27.660]   Satan hates strong manhood.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:34.900]   Satan recognizes that if he can take down strong men, he's won.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:39.020]   He's basically game over, at least in societal terms.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:47.300]   And so the lie that feminism and wokeness and Marxism and psychotherapy and different
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:55.240]   forms all say today is that if we do away with strong manhood, the world will heal.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.060]   Everybody will be nice.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:01.660]   There won't be any imperialism or patriarchy or oppression or injustice.
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:05.020]   We'll just be nice to each other.
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.060]   You know, I'm putting this in a slightly humorous form, but honestly, this is, for example,
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:15.300]   in terms of CEOs and leadership and business culture, all the rage, as some of you know,
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:20.640]   is on the side of inclusivity and group buy-in, right?
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:26.660]   This has even infected soccer teams and pro sports where the manager can't really be a
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.340]   manager anymore.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:34.940]   He's got to kind of be the one who shapes and is at the mercy of group consensus.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:39.900]   And what we've got to say is, of course, you know, a godly man is open to reason and humble
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.660]   and et cetera and so on.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:46.740]   But fundamentally, all of these movements work against strong manhood, and that's because
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:51.620]   strong men are the ones who stand against the evil men in the world.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:56.160]   Strong men are what are keeping the world okay.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:02.020]   If you take away strong men, it's not going to be the case that everybody is now nice.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:07.580]   It's going to be the case that the evil men only are worse and worse and worse.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:12.020]   So Satan hates all of that, and Satan has good reason to hate it because strong manhood
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.220]   is what crushed his head at the cross.
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:23.220]   Toxic, use the word pejorative, that's all it is, right?
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:29.060]   And you said it in your session this morning, masculinity manhood is wrong in their eyes.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:31.820]   I mean, if I said, "I got something for you to drink here," it's toxic.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:32.820]   You don't want it.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820]   It's bad.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.820]   It's gross.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:37.340]   And, you know, you've said it well.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:42.540]   God has set up a structure the world doesn't like because Satan doesn't like it.
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.860]   He's the god of this world, 2 Corinthians 4, 4, 1 John 5.
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:50.540]   God rules over this place, and we're living in it as a counterculture.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:55.900]   Therefore, we've got to get used to the countercultural value of men should lead.
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:57.220]   Men have to be decisive.
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.860]   Men have to exercise dominion.
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.980]   Men have to be authoritative in several situations.
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.220]   Look at the motifs in Scripture.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.960]   How many of them are about war?
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.960]   How many of them are about fighting?
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.140]   How many of them are the weapons of our warfare?
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.580]   Not weapons of the world, but they're weapons for the right hand and for the left, right?
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.900]   Destroying strongholds, tearing down every argument that raises itself up against God.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900]   That's not nice, right?
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:18.820]   There's nothing about—there's no call in your life to be nice, right?
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.700]   There's call in your life to be loving, and love often has to make decisions that your
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:25.700]   family doesn't like, that your kids don't like.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.780]   We just have to get back to what God says, and we've got to care about that and care
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.700]   a whole lot less about what the culture thinks.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.700]   - Amen.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:36.780]   - Now, again, the world is using that term.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:41.340]   It's not a biblical word, and it certainly doesn't have a biblical definition to it.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:48.860]   However, at the same time, there are certainly sinful ways in which we can express masculinity,
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:53.860]   you know, and kind of do it under the banner, right, of godly masculinity, but we can express
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.500]   it sinfully.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.540]   So how do we define that?
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:58.900]   What might it look like?
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:02.180]   And then I think that the last thing would be then how do we guard our hearts from it?
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.380]   - Now, let me take that first.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:12.940]   Authority, power, anything muscular, anything strong, right, can be used for self-aggrandizement,
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:13.940]   for self-service, right?
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:18.220]   And that's why I briefly talked about we're not dictators in our homes, right, but we
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:19.480]   have to be the authoritarian.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.540]   There has to be an enforcer.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.100]   There has to be someone that's going to set the rules and keep them and make sure they're
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:26.100]   kept.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:31.740]   So I'm either using my masculinity, my strength in my home to promote good and do what's right
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:34.940]   and do what's best, both in society and in my household.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:38.340]   - SWB audio capture, not registered.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:46.620]   - You know, or these pictures of the just continual self-promotion and self-satisfaction,
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.380]   that's not what we're here for.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:52.460]   We're here to do something to better our society, right?
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.540]   That's a common grace.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.820]   Your workplace should be doing something good.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:00.700]   It's gainful employment for the good of society, and your leadership in your home is not for
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:01.940]   your own good.
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:05.660]   It's not so you can build your man cave and just hang out and do your own thing.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:08.460]   It's about, "Sir, I want to leave my kids better.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:09.460]   I want to leave my wife better.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:10.700]   I want to leave my church better.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:12.620]   I want to leave society better."
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:16.900]   And that's where I think we use the strength of manhood for a better cause.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.940]   And as soon as it turns toward me, I want to serve myself.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:23.660]   Well, then that obviously is not biblical masculinity.
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:32.680]   - Yeah, you don't have to go to secular therapy to find the resources, as Mike just well said,
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.820]   to coach men into godly manhood.
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:41.180]   You think about, I'll just take one text, 1 Peter 3, 1 to 7, which has admittedly six
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:44.940]   verses that shape godly women's behavior, and that really matters.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:48.820]   And by the way, we can't only talk to men and we can't only punch men in the arm.
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:53.540]   We have to help women understand biblical womanhood, and we can't sugarcoat that.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:57.620]   I think actually a lot of younger women in particular want the strong stuff.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:02.780]   They want to hear a pastor stand up with some courage and say, "Here's biblical womanhood.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:07.420]   This may sound kind of strongly countercultural to you, and it may be that way, but here's
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.760]   some truth I need to give you."
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.100]   In the same way, though, men have to understand that God calls us to live with our wives in
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.220]   an understanding way.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.500]   So there you go.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:25.140]   What a call out of anything that could be called toxicity and into kindness, tenderness,
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:32.580]   gentleness, love, being a good listener, not being like the guy in the Klondike commercial
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:38.100]   where his wife starts talking, a 10-second timer starts, his knee starts bouncing.
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:41.300]   And then when he listens to the audio capture, it's two over 10 seconds, he gets to the Klondike
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.300]   bar.
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.820]   I mean, and like there's cheering and people, you know, high-five him and that sort of thing.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:51.660]   No, you have to do a lot of empathizing and a lot of listening and a lot of locking in
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:56.100]   and not a lot of jumping right to the solution and all the things we all know very well if
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:58.020]   we've been married for longer than six minutes.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:05.540]   So the resources to not be toxic are already abundantly laid out in Scripture.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.300]   We men stumble in many ways.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:10.980]   The good news is the Spirit's working in us to make us more like Christ.
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:16.180]   - I have a lot of questions now about the guy that might come to church with a Klondike
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:17.180]   shirt.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.620]   Just kind of wonder how he got that.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:24.140]   But how about this?
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:34.980]   How do we lead our homes when our wives oppose, and in particular, godly approaches to parenting?
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:45.700]   - It's funny, you used the word understanding from the text, right?
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.540]   There's a translation of Gnosko, to know.
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:48.980]   I lived with your wife in a knowing way.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:50.940]   You're supposed to understand.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.900]   And I think there's a lot of understanding we should have even about when our wife is
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:47:00.460]   sinning or our children are sinning and they're not wanting to conform harmoniously to what
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:01.460]   Scripture says.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:02.780]   That ought to be my only concern.
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:07.140]   Am I going to hear well done from God about what I'm demanding in my household?
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:12.500]   And so I need to understand even when my wife is sinning, not just when she's who she is,
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:17.420]   different than me, and I want to make sure I'm loving her and understanding in an insightful
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:18.420]   way.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:21.220]   But, you know, why is my wife opposing this?
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.220]   What is her concern?
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:25.600]   And sometimes you just got to realize some of your concern is because of your proclivities
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.380]   as a female or maybe just because of who knows what, but we're going to do what we have to
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:32.100]   do, what we're supposed to do.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.500]   And yeah, is that going to cause disagreement?
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:34.500]   Of course.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.140]   Godliness in a household doesn't mean there's not disagreement.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:42.700]   It can be vehement disagreement about things, but you as the final authority are going to
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:48.820]   have to impose some standards for how you raise your children.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:53.840]   And those may come, it may be hard fought, but you have to do that and you have to insist
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.540]   upon it and then let the chips fall.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:59.340]   Because if all you want is peace, and that's the problem with a lot of men in the room,
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.340]   all they want is peace.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.340]   I want my wife to be happy.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.500]   You know, happy wife, happy life is what they say.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:04.980]   And it's absurd.
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.780]   What I want is a godly home.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.460]   And sometimes that's going to take some coaxing, some winning, some discipleship, some pulling
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.380]   along to get my wife to get there.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:15.900]   But even if she doesn't get there, I want to hear well done from God.
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.140]   So I'm going to have to say, well, we're going to have to do this.
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:21.060]   And there's been a lot of disappointment like that in my marriage and I'm sure in all of
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.060]   our marriages.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:23.920]   We have to say, this is just what we're going to do this.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.020]   This is what we're going to do.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.820]   Now some men are so, you know, emasculated in their homes.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:32.820]   They would think that I would be, you know, moving out tonight because my wife's not going
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:33.820]   to have it.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:37.740]   Well, that's probably the compounding of a lot of other problems and mistakes that led
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.740]   to that.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.220]   But I would hope, like if I went home tonight and said to my wife, this is what we're doing.
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:42.220]   We're going to do it.
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:43.220]   And I know she didn't want to do it.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.220]   Right?
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:47.380]   She's going to have, she's going to say, okay, it's not going to, it'll be an icy evening,
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:51.820]   but at least she knows if I say this is what we're going to do for our kids, that's what
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:52.860]   we're going to do for our kids.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.980]   So there's a lot just in developing leadership and trust in your wife's life.
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:00.700]   But in the end of the day, does this please God, this decision I'm trying to put through
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.700]   as it relates to how I raise my kids?
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:09.940]   - Yeah, I mean, I think just piggybacking off what Mike said, I mean, her opposition,
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:15.220]   if we assume in the question that what the guy's doing is biblical and right, her opposition
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:22.660]   to it or her dragging her heels on it mustn't paralyze you from doing what's right.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:28.060]   And you know, and you trust God to honor you as you honor Him.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:35.940]   And ultimately, you know, again, depends on the level of opposition or disagreement.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:40.260]   You know, you've got a greater issue than her disagreeing with your parenting.
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.420]   Something's going on there.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:48.780]   If you have properly understood the Word of God and you abide it and you do it with humility
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:54.660]   and with balance, and she opposes that, you've got a bigger issue.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:59.780]   You know, she's either out of step with the Lord, you know, she's got an unregenerate
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:07.560]   heart and it's going to show… this issue will simply, you know, manifest in something
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.860]   bigger that needs to be addressed.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:15.460]   And at that point, you know, you redefine what it is to live with a nonbeliever or you
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:20.520]   maybe flip 1 Peter 3 where the woman is encouraged in certain ways, "Here's what you've got
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:24.180]   to do when you're living with a husband that doesn't obey the Word."
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:29.220]   Well, I don't know, you know, whatever some of that truth could be to flip, "Here's what
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:33.100]   you've got to do when you have a wife that doesn't obey the Word."
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.340]   So, but the main thing is you can't, as Mike said, you can't surrender the ground.
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:48.400]   You can't, you know, not do what God has called you to do, you know, and hopefully as you
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.300]   talk her through that, lead her gently but firmly, you're uncompromising in what you
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.300]   do.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:59.460]   In God's grace and providence, you would trust that the product of what you're producing
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:05.900]   in the life of your child will be a challenge to her as she sees the Scripture, you know,
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:11.300]   work and the law of God's perfect law, you know, produce good results.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:16.660]   Is there ever a point that you involve others from the church?
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:17.660]   Absolutely.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.740]   I don't mean, I don't know exactly what the trigger point is.
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:27.480]   It wouldn't be the first thing you would do, but at some point when prayer and patience
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.860]   and providence has unfolded, it could be bringing another woman in that she's either friendly
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.860]   with or trusts.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:37.740]   It could be, you know, bringing a church leader in, going to see a pastor.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:44.500]   I don't know, but certainly there's that growing up in stature together, there's that leaning
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:48.220]   on each other, you know, but that would be…
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.620]   SWB audio capture not registered.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:56.720]   It doesn't seem you're tattletaling and running to get her into trouble, but hey, we can do
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:57.720]   better than this.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.280]   We should do better than this.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.380]   Let's invite others who can help us do better.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.420]   I hope you're not insisting on a lot of things with your wife.
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:10.900]   And I think if this is just another thing you're insisting on, I think she can be very
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:13.900]   selective about what she agrees to.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:17.140]   But I think most men here probably want to please their wives, right?
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:19.260]   And we'd like to do what they want.
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:23.340]   And I think if you're insisting on what to watch and where to eat and, you know, what
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:28.180]   time you eat, well then of course when you insist that you're not going to let your teenage
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:32.820]   kids stay home from church or you say they're going to go to church, she sees it's just
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.740]   another thing you insist on.
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:39.260]   I think most of the thing my pattern is I don't insist on very much at all.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.840]   But when I insist on something, it gets her attention.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.340]   Like if I say, if I save on a 529 plan to send my kid to college and they're out of
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:50.300]   my house, but they're still under my financial support and my college kid says I'm not going
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.820]   to church while I'm in college, right?
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:56.000]   And my wife is tempted to say, "Oh, it's okay."
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]   And I say, "No."
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000]   It's a parenting principle.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.220]   I am not supporting my child even if they're out of my house.
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:05.300]   If my money is paying for their college tuition, he's going to go to church or I'm going to
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.140]   pull his money, right?
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:08.540]   I can see that and it has been.
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:13.140]   I just picked that because it's a counseling situation, right, that we encounter from time
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.140]   to time.
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:17.980]   I would say, "Husband, you insist on it and you insist on it, I hope not as a pattern
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:19.900]   of insisting on everything.
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:22.300]   There's very few things you insist, but you're going to insist on that."
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.620]   And then you pull someone else in on it.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:27.680]   That's going to be a hard situation, but I would say, "I hope you can settle that as
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.560]   a man in your own home."
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:33.040]   And I would love to convince my wife, but at the end of the day, if my wife and I disagreed
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.760]   on that, I would have to say, "I insist.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.440]   We're not...we're pulling his money.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.680]   I guess he's going to either have to work and put himself through college or he's coming
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:41.680]   home."
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:45.080]   Because those are the kinds of principles we knew from the time they were children.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.120]   Our kids are going to go to church, right?
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.640]   They're going to eat out of our refrigerator if they're going to church.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.220]   Well, they may be eating out of their refrigerator...
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.980]   - SWB audio capture not registered.
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:58.940]   - I just use one example to put flesh on this problem.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:01.140]   To me, that's a Christian parenting principle.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.940]   My wife doesn't agree, and I think she's always going to tend to, most women, to capitulate
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:06.940]   toward, "I want to be nice.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:07.940]   I want to be kind.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.500]   I want to be understanding."
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.060]   And we're saying, "Well, there is a limit here."
[01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:12.660]   And we just stepped over the limit.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.460]   I insist that we do that.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.660]   And at least for my wife, she didn't hear that very often.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.360]   But when she does, "Oh, you know, okay."
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.360]   That's a big deal.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:26.880]   - Yeah, and if the house is an absolute stink fest, you know, most of the time, and you
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:33.440]   don't have good marital dynamics, and you're not trying to win her, you know, there's not
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:39.920]   a lot of warmth in the relationship, and yet you're thinking that your iron decrees are
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.360]   going to be handed down from on high.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.240]   I don't know that that's going to go very well.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.820]   We all stumble here.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:51.260]   You don't want to be scared of your wife or something like that, but you do need to be
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:52.260]   a Christ-like husband.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:58.900]   I mean, this is a big deal to love your wife as Christ loves the church, love as many facets
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:54:59.900]   and dimensions.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:04.780]   It doesn't just mean, you know, throw roses in her direction and follow her around the
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.260]   house cooing in her ear, but it does mean a real warmth.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:14.700]   And I'm concerned with the younger generation online and some of the patriarchy movement
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.820]   out there.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:19.600]   There's some very good voices in that world.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.380]   I am concerned, though, that I see a generation of young men who are getting a vision for
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.740]   leading in their home.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:30.680]   In a lot of cases, they haven't seen that, and it hasn't been done well.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:33.220]   And they're like, "I want to do the Bible thing.
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:37.820]   I'm going to lead, and I give thanks to God for that to a degree.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.200]   I really do."
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.780]   But I am concerned that they might interpret that call as like hand down edicts and then
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:53.880]   their job is done, when in reality, husband and dad is doing a lot more, I would say,
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.880]   winning his wife, winning his kids.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.120]   And your wife is not like your kids.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:05.440]   But there is a corollary where you're trying to shovel a lot of love into that relationship
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.200]   so that when the hard words come in, you know, there's something in the bank and that child
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.040]   doesn't despise you for that.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:16.200]   Your wife's not a child at all, but there is a principle there of like, "I'm trying
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.400]   to win this woman's heart."
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.000]   You hear the stories about the guys who give their wife a rose every day for 40 years,
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.840]   and we all get shamed by that as husbands because we don't do that.
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:32.680]   But whatever we specifically do to love our wife, men, especially young men, we've got
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:37.480]   to make sure we don't only try to lead, we've got to make sure we love her.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.800]   Yeah, and I want to underscore this because Owen's so well read when he talks about this
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:44.560]   emergent patriarchy movement.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.520]   You've got to know that nothing we're saying here from this platform is about that.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:54.780]   This is a, you know, these young guys are getting turned onto this idea of men as leaders
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:58.200]   in the home and they're becoming dictators in their household.
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.380]   That patriarchy movement is bad.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.700]   So if you don't even know what he's talking about, you will hear more and more about it.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.760]   People from your church will say, "Well, I want you to be the man, you need to be the
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.020]   leader," and they're becoming little despots in their home.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:12.520]   That is not what we're talking about when we talk about manning up in our household.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.800]   We have to make a distinguishing distance from that.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.400]   That is not what we're saying.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.080]   And like I try to say, "I want to please my wife.
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.600]   I hope you want to please your wife.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.120]   My wife wants to do something different for dinner tonight.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.400]   No, let's have at it.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:24.640]   I want her to be happy."
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:27.520]   But we have limits in terms of what we say.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.060]   This has to happen because God wants our family to do this and her tendency is always going
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:34.180]   to be toward niceness.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.060]   Niceness is not the goal, right?
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.060]   Godliness is the goal.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:41.660]   - Owen, could you talk for one minute on what about the patriarchy movement?
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:43.100]   Who are the leaders?
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:44.100]   What's its source?
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:46.300]   I mean, kick a couple of minutes on that.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.980]   - Yeah, very quickly.
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:54.500]   The figure most associated with it is Doug Wilson out of Moscow, Idaho, Canon Press,
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.500]   and Christchurch?
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:56.500]   I think it's Christchurch.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:03.980]   And Wilson has taken some good stands and Wilson has said some good things.
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:08.700]   And I've read his manhood book, "Future Men," for example, and derived some real wisdom
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.700]   from it.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.580]   So, let us not hear this in a burndown kind of way.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:18.580]   But nonetheless, I'm concerned especially with how the rising generation is hearing
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:25.580]   Wilson and is receiving Wilson, again, out of a context of, in many cases, brokenness
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:32.660]   and dad out of the home and not strong churches and godly manhood not being balanced in the
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.320]   way that these men have been talking about.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:42.460]   And so, there can be a situation where the young men hear that call to patriarchal leadership
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.220]   and the young men can arm up in that.
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:49.900]   But instead of a godly boldness, it can end up being a brashness.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:59.180]   And I honestly fear for women and children in these homes because authority is a very
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.580]   serious thing to have.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:06.980]   It needs to be stewarded really well, as Mike said very well just a few minutes ago.
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:14.820]   And I'm concerned that there are men who think that really what the Bible teaches is patriarchy.
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:20.900]   And so, if I am just kind of the serious leader of this home, that's the deal.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:26.580]   And wife and children just line up wherever I say to line up and I run this home and any
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:32.780]   challenge to my authority, any disagreement on matters, wife wanting to go to a different
[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:38.340]   restaurant than me, that's open rebellion and I will not tolerate it.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:40.980]   That's going to break the family down where we stand.
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.460]   Again, that's not where all those men are.
[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:45.160]   That's not what all of them say.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:48.540]   I'm concerned with how it's being lived out and heard.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:50.820]   And I see real problems with that.
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.820]   We can't...
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:52.900]   Last thing I'll say, I'm going on here.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:58.000]   We can't so react to feminism that we end up overreacting, right?
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:06.140]   We can't so react to woke feminism that we end up genuinely bad men.
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:11.140]   We've got to be balanced men, which is probably the hardest thing to do as a Christian, to
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:12.620]   be balanced.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:15.240]   But we've got to be strong but loving.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.980]   We can't be one or the other.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:17.980]   - That's good.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:20.260]   - Yeah, finding the biblical middle.
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:27.380]   So last question, this one is probably the most difficult because it comes with a restriction.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:30.140]   Yes or no?
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:32.300]   Can a man become a woman?
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:33.980]   - No.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:40.380]   - Well, as I told you it was going to be difficult.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:45.700]   To quote Philip's favorite most quotable person, John MacArthur.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:50.820]   John MacArthur once said that he was a man trapped in a woman's body, but then he was
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:52.660]   born.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.980]   - Good.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:58.180]   That's good.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:04.660]   - I'm going to steal that one.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.380]   - That's a good note to end on right there.
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:07.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.500]   So, Philip, do you want me to go ahead and close in prayer or?
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.420]   Let's close in prayer.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:13.980]   Father God, we come before you again.
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:15.300]   We're needy people.
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:18.980]   We do depend on you and as men, we need to show that.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:20.740]   We need to show that we are dependent on you.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:26.180]   We were created in your image to bear your image and to depend on you for all counsel,
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:30.660]   all wisdom, all strength, all help, and we need it.
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:33.540]   Help us to be men who lead in prayer.
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:39.340]   Help us to be men who lead in depending on you and depending on one another and developing
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:44.780]   community whether in our homes and within our churches for the glory of your name.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:52.980]   Father, we are grateful for the calling that you have given to us to be men and to be men
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:56.520]   of God as children of you.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.660]   Help us to recognize that as a...
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:03.380]   Not only is it a responsibility, it's a huge privilege to do that.
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:11.820]   So help us to lead in the proclamation of your son and help us to lead people into the
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:17.860]   worship of you as father and help us to do it in the ways that you have prescribed for
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.740]   us to do it, striking a balance and being faithful.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:28.260]   And as a result, then, may you glorify yourself as we continue to abide in you.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:30.260]   Amen.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:30.260]   Amen.
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:31.260]   Amen.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:31.260]   [applause]
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.260]   Hey, I know you guys...
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.260]   Hey, I know you guys...
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:37.260]   Hello?
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:42.260]   I know you guys are all taking off.
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:44.260]   That's fine.
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:52.540]   I want to say a few quick thank yous.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:53.540]   These things don't happen by themselves.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.420]   I want to thank our speakers.
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:59.820]   One more round of applause for Owen, for Mike, and for Phillip.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.420]   Without them, there's no point in having an At Trust Conference.
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:08.220]   Our KTT board members who are here, Tom Grossi, what a great job with music, always.
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:14.060]   Our ministry partners who are here today, an army of volunteers in my team, Daniel Bracey,
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:17.900]   Jerry Moto, Cara Bray, and Estella Roach, and really all of you.
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:20.980]   Thanks for being here and travel safely home.
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:23.100]   It looks like you'll be rain free.
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.100]   Take care.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:24.100]   We'll see you guys.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.100]   [applause]
