[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.540]   - We experience letdowns all the time.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.260]   In a fallen world of sin,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.020]   we shouldn't be surprised by disappointment.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.060]   But this long history of letdowns
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.900]   met its match on Easter morning.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.780]   That's the hopeful reality we live in
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.940]   on this side of the death and resurrection
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.020]   of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.220]   As John Piper reminds us in his Easter sermon from 1988
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.260]   on 1 Corinthians 15 verses 20 to 28.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.260]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.060]   - One of the most heartbreaking words I think
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.460]   in human language is the word closed.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.260]   You plan a day at the zoo and dad takes a day off
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.100]   and mom packs a special lunch and the kids are all excited.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.260]   You pile in the car, you drive a half an hour
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.140]   and you get to the gate and it says closed.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.020]   Hope deferred makes the heart sick like the Proverbs says.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.100]   You're 11 years old and it's summertime
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.180]   and the ball teams are starting to practice
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.380]   and for the first time,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.880]   mom, can I play baseball this summer?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.660]   Maybe that would be a good thing this summer.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.140]   And so you get a brand new glove
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.780]   and dad pitches with you in the backyard
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.420]   and you go out for the team
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.300]   and you practice for them for two weeks.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.020]   It turns out there are too many kids for this team
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.620]   and they didn't plan for two teams
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.340]   and so there's gotta be a cut.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.940]   And you go that afternoon and they read the roster
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.780]   and you're not on it.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.340]   And you take the back roads home.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.780]   The coach says we'll plan for two teams next year
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.500]   and it doesn't help, it's closed.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140]   Or maybe you're 13 years old
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.620]   and you start to dream about marriage.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.260]   You dream about that perfect person
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260]   and what it would be like to have somebody hold you
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.460]   and love you more than anybody else in all the world
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.500]   and what that day would be like
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.140]   and then one door closes and then another door closes
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.260]   and another door closes.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.940]   Or maybe you're at mid-career, mid-40s let's say,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.220]   and you step back and you look at your life
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.540]   and your career and you say,
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.900]   what do I want to accomplish here now
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.540]   in the next 20 years of my active professional life?
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.060]   You think it through and you say,
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500]   I'm gonna stick with the firm and give it my best shot.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.900]   And so you work nights
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.060]   and you work long hours on the weekend
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.260]   and you work on vacations and five years go by
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.340]   and you're 50 and they pass right over you
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.780]   when it comes to that advancement.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.220]   And you don't make it and the door closes
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.180]   on that dream career.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.980]   Or maybe for you, all the doors opened
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.740]   and the relationships clicked
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.060]   and you made the team
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060]   and then somewhere along the way,
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.020]   the doctor said, it's a rare kind of cancer
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.060]   and all the doors seem to close at once.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.940]   Or worst of all,
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.340]   you have made it to the top in your career.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.260]   You have had the dream relationship.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.700]   You've made every team and walked through every open door
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.940]   and every one of them without Jesus.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.060]   And now you've died and you're standing
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.300]   before heaven's door and it's closed.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.940]   And you say, "Lord, Lord, open to me."
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.740]   And the voice comes back,
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.380]   "Truly, truly I say to you, I never knew you."
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.660]   The word "closed" is a heartbreaking word
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.100]   in this life and in the life to come.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.260]   And I want to declare loud and clear this morning
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.940]   that the meaning of Easter
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.780]   is that God is in the business
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.700]   of clearing this world of heartbreak.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.540]   The meaning of an empty tomb
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.380]   or the opening of a closed tomb
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.540]   is that God has begun a campaign with Jesus Christ
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.860]   to open a million doors of hope
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.140]   to people who trust in Him.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.380]   The verse that I'm going to focus on this morning
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.340]   from our text in 1 Corinthians 15 is verse 25.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.380]   It is a verse that gripped me
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.860]   because it is so full of door-opening,
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.980]   sovereign hope.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.820]   It says, "Jesus must reign
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.900]   until He has put all His enemies under His feet."
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.260]   Jesus must reign.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.980]   And as I meditated on that verse,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.940]   I saw four things about the reign of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.500]   And I hardly had to twist and maneuver at all
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.060]   to get these four things to spell "open."
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.740]   O-P-E-N
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.580]   The opening of the reign
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.380]   at the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.940]   The presence of the reign here and now in your life.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.740]   The extent of the reign
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.460]   unto all His enemies.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.860]   And the necessity of His reign
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.100]   in the deity of His Father.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.220]   And so I want to talk about those four dimensions
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.900]   of the reign of God this morning.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.900]   And I want you, with the pen of your heart,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.100]   with your will, to write O-P-E-N
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.420]   over the door of disappointment in your life.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.980]   I want you to take the one
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.180]   that has you down most now.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.900]   You got it?
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.540]   One door.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.020]   Not all of them.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.820]   Just one closed door in your life.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.780]   It might have closed yesterday
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.780]   or ten years ago
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.860]   or thirty years ago.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.340]   And it's still closed.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.300]   I want you to write beside the door.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.220]   O-P-E-N
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.260]   Open right over the door
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.860]   of the disappointment in your life.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.460]   Amen.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.140]   The disappointments and heartbreaks
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.420]   and letdowns have been decisively defeated in Christ.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.140]   This hope is our hope as we celebrate Easter.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.100]   And this clip was taken from John Piper's sermon
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   titled "He Must Reign,"
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.340]   preached back on Easter Sunday, April 3rd, 1988.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.180]   You can find the full message in the archive
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.900]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   So Easter breaks our heartbreak
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.940]   and it also breaks our sin.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.940]   That's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   Thanks for listening.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.180]   [Silence]
