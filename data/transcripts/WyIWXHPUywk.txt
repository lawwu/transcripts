[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   praise and the assembly of the Holy Ones.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.820]   Let Israel be glad in His Maker, let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King, let them praise
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.760]   His name with dancing, with tambourine and lyre let them sing praises to Him.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.760]   For YHWH takes pleasure in His people, He will beautify the afflicted ones with salvation.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.640]   Let the Holy Ones exalt in glory, let them sing for joy on their beds, let the exaltations
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.840]   of God be in their throats and a two-edged sword in their hand, to execute vengeance
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.220]   on the nations and punishments on the peoples, to bind their kings with chains and their
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.640]   honored men with fetters of iron, to execute on them the judgments written.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.880]   This is the majesty of all His Holy Ones, praise YAH."
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.940]   "Praise YAH, sing to YHWH a new song, His praise and the assembly of the Holy Ones.
