[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Well, winning the war against lust
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.680]   is by far the most common theme
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.080]   of all the emails we get in our inbox.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.760]   And today's question comes from an anonymous listener.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.040]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.320]   I am a female college student in Maryland
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.020]   and I love listening to your podcast.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840]   Thank you for the encouragement
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.180]   and the truth that you put out each week.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.640]   My question is this,
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   how exactly does one transform the way they think?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.200]   The Bible talks about letting your mind be transformed,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.680]   but I feel like it's not so cut and dry
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.800]   as it is laid out in scripture.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.840]   Lately, I've been struggling with lustful thoughts
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.700]   that make me feel very insecure and guilty.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.880]   So how do I deal with this,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.320]   especially in a sex crazed culture?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640]   I wanna fight the temptations
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.040]   and every time a lustful thought occurs,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.560]   I feel like I've let God down.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.680]   How do I let my mind get transformed as the Bible says,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640]   so that I can win this overwhelming and exhausting battle?
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.480]   How exactly does one transform the way they think?
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.520]   That's where she starts.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.220]   So let me pick up there.
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.320]   There's so many pieces to her words
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.340]   that I'm probably not gonna touch on every one of them,
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.340]   but let me give our college student friend in Maryland
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.620]   a simple two-part paradigm
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.620]   for transforming the way she, we think,
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.840]   and then try to fill it out with a few details.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.680]   Let me use the analogy of becoming physically fit
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380]   or physically transformed into fitness
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.320]   to illustrate how we may become spiritually
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.940]   or mentally transformed in fitness.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.740]   Almost everybody would see the common sense
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.160]   in saying that if you want to be physically fit,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.720]   there would be two aspects to the process of transformation.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.580]   Let's call them resistance and reception.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.660]   By resistance, I mean the kinds of exercises
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.000]   that put your muscle under great deal
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   of unnatural strain, right?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.960]   For example, you want your biceps to be stronger
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.120]   so you can lift heavier packages
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.600]   or lift light ones more easily.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   You curl a weight up and down,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.820]   say 10, 15, 20 pounds,
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.080]   and you do it enough times that the last one,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560]   you can barely do it.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   The resistance is so strong against your bicep.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.280]   And in that process of resistance,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.420]   the bicep ironically becomes stronger.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.180]   It's strange that you make yourself look like an idiot,
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.520]   trembling and pulling and unable to pull it up
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.680]   for the 10th or 20th time,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.160]   and out of that weakness, a few weeks later,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.020]   lo and behold, your bicep is stronger.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.580]   And what I mean by reception, so that was resistance.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.900]   What I mean by reception is that you take into your body,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.160]   you receive healthy foods and sufficient sleep,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.220]   the kind of activity that is not so much pushing
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.900]   against something, but rather welcoming right
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   and good things into your body.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.200]   So there's the analogy, and you can work with it
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.420]   and see if I've got it right physically,
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.240]   'cause I don't know much about that,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.360]   but it seems to work for me.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.380]   And now let's apply it to the spiritual mental fitness
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.420]   of the way the Bible says it happens.
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.560]   And of course, these resistance and reception
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.780]   are not sequential.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.500]   They're not sequential, like some days you do resistance
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.900]   and some days you eat.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.140]   No, it's simultaneous at the same time,
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.140]   in the same days.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.060]   First, there's the biblical principle of resistance.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.340]   So James says in James 4, 7,
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.740]   "Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.340]   And Paul says in Romans 8, 13,
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.420]   "Put to death, kill the deeds of the body by the spirit."
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.380]   So we kill specific sins by targeting them
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.100]   with lethal resistance.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.900]   James 1, verse 3,
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   "The testing of your faith produces steadfastness."
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.820]   So the testing of faith corresponds
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.820]   to the lifting of the barbell by your bicep.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.620]   Some temptation or some suffering comes into your life
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.260]   and threatens to conquer you
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.640]   and ruin your faith and your holiness.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.100]   And you have to lay hold on a promise of God
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100]   and push hard against the rising doubt and unbelief
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.340]   with all your might as you rely upon the promise of God.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.980]   And so push back the encroaching darkness,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.900]   just like you push on the floor when you do pushups.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.480]   Why?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Because this produces steadfastness or endurance.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.720]   This means that those tests,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   those pressures of unbelief and temptation,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.820]   those tests that have to be resisted by faith
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.940]   result in two things.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.900]   They enable us to resist greater tests,
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.020]   greater temptations, greater suffering in the future.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.140]   And they enable us to meet the old test
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.460]   that used to make us stumble with relative ease
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.140]   so that we're not thrown into crisis
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.140]   every time we meet some sexual temptation, say.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.800]   Now, all of this applies to lust and sexual temptation
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.700]   because those are thoughts and tests
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.020]   that we have to resist.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.860]   We have to take hold of a promise of Christ,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.300]   believe it, and then use it to push,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.260]   actively push the thought out of our minds.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.000]   We say, "No, no, no."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.280]   I mean, I do this.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.700]   I'm not kidding here.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.820]   I mean, a thought, some lustful thought or some image
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.420]   comes into your mind,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.260]   and you've got about five seconds to decide
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.500]   whether you're gonna let it take over
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   or whether you're gonna push on it with,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.740]   "No, you're out of here.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.960]   "In Jesus' name, you're out of here."
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.940]   Directing your attention to some superior promise.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.860]   Jesus is better.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.020]   Jesus is enough.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.900]   He said this.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.360]   You're out of here, and you keep pushing until it's gone.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.660]   So that's what I mean by resistance.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.040]   The resistance half of transformation.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.280]   And I want to encourage you that even though it may feel
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.380]   or sound exhausting at first,
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.780]   it really does yield a peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.140]   Read Hebrews 12, and you'll see what I mean.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.640]   Now, here's the second half.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.780]   That's only the first half.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.780]   And so many Christians try to solve the problems
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.840]   of their temptations and their defeats
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.620]   only by the resistance half of sanctification.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.460]   It won't work.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.900]   It just won't work in the long run.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.900]   So let me give what I mean by the reception part.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.960]   Second Corinthians 3:18,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   "We all, with unveiled face,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.380]   "beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.480]   "are being transformed into the same image
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.460]   "from one degree of glory to another.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.760]   "This comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.180]   Notice, this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.460]   We are receivers.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.380]   We are receivers.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.820]   This is the reception side.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.820]   We are fixing our gaze on the glory of the Lord.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.460]   And we do that mainly in the Word.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.420]   We linger over the sweet and beautiful descriptions
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.060]   of the person and the work of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.060]   We marinate our minds receptively by faith
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.000]   in the crock pot of God's Word.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And we fix our eyes, the eyes of our hearts on Jesus.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.800]   And the more we receive and receive into our hearts
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.040]   the beauty of Christ through the eyes of the heart
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.280]   as we read and meditate,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.000]   the more we will have his desires.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   His preferences, his convictions.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   We will be receptively transformed.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.040]   Oh, how sweet to have that receptive transformation
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.720]   so that the hooks of the devil
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   don't even lodge themselves anymore.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.560]   Here's another passage to stir in.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.360]   Colossians 3.10, that reminds us
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   that in Jesus we are new creatures.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   We have new selves, but we must put on the new self.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.080]   That is, receive the new self.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.520]   Put it on like a coat, consciously receive it.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.040]   But there's a phrase in Colossians 3.10
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.760]   that tips us off how it happens.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.360]   It says, "Put on the new self," and here it comes,
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   "which is being renewed in knowledge
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.640]   after the image of its creator."
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.200]   So the transformation of the mind and the desires
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   and the thoughts of the new self happens in knowledge.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.720]   This is just like saying, "Look to Jesus more and more
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.400]   and your thoughts and your feelings will be changed.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.640]   You will experience your newness."
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.120]   Here's the last passage I'll mention
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.400]   that relates to newness through beholding Christ,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.280]   newness through knowledge,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.720]   and it relates specifically to sexual temptation.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.920]   1 Thessalonians 4, verses three through five.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.120]   Here's what Paul says.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.960]   "This is the will of God, your sanctification,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   that you abstain from sexual immorality,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.560]   that each one of you know how to control his own body
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.260]   in holiness and honor," and here comes the key,
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:22.260]   "not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.680]   who do not know God."
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.280]   So notice where Paul lays the fault of sexual passion,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.840]   taking control and ruining our lives.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.440]   He says that passion, that sinful passion,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   rules in people who do not know,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.000]   just like Colossians 3.10, don't know,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.160]   just like 2 Corinthians 3.18, don't see, don't meditate on,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.380]   don't know, don't absorb, don't receive the knowledge of God.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.760]   In other words, they haven't been renewed in knowledge.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   They haven't set their minds to behold the glory of Jesus
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.000]   day and night so that they become like what they admire
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.920]   and so they are at the mercy of their sinful passions
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   because they haven't been transformed
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.920]   by putting on the new self, renewed in knowledge.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.720]   So that's the biblical pattern of transforming our minds
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.240]   and our hearts so that we are less vulnerable
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.520]   to sexual temptation.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.660]   It's both resistance against unbelief and temptation
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.600]   and doubt and Satan, and it is the sweet,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.720]   enjoyable reception through God's word
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.960]   of the preciousness and the beauty
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.440]   and the greatness of Jesus.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.520]   Both resistance and reception over time
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.400]   transforms our hearts and our minds.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.240]   - So critical.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, for joining in the fight
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   against lust over the years
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.720]   and for taking so many questions in the podcast
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.960]   about this ongoing struggle.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.040]   And thanks for the question.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.800]   Many questions are anonymous.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.960]   We always respect your privacy when you send those in to us
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.880]   and just say in the email,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.560]   I would prefer not to have my name mentioned.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.640]   We'll always respect that.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.540]   And many of our questions come from college students
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.400]   who are seeking to honor Christ on campus,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.320]   and it's not easy.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.160]   In fact, it's a huge challenge for students
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.400]   who are in state colleges, in private colleges,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.960]   Christian colleges, all of them come
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.600]   with real-life temptations that resonate
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.200]   with many other listeners.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.640]   And we would love to hear the questions that you face
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   because every time we get a question,
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.840]   it's articulating questions and challenges
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.600]   that many other listeners face.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.160]   That's really what this podcast is about.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.720]   It's about hearing from you to address a group of people
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.560]   who are facing the same thing
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.400]   because we are really in this together,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.060]   helping one another.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.480]   And you can send us your questions
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.320]   through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.780]   I am not sure what's next on the docket,
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.180]   but Lord willing, we will return on Friday
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.340]   with another one of your excellent
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.220]   and thoughtful and specific questions.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.060]   I'm your host Tony Reik.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.340]   Thanks for listening to the podcast,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.820]   and we will see you next time.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
