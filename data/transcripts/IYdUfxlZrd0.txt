[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.520]   Hey, Kyle.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   I have a question about metric tracking.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   I have been tracking deep work metrics day by day
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.400]   in my time block planner based on the number of hours
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.240]   I'm working.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   And I'm finding that hours is not a granular enough metric.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.160]   Some mornings I might work one hour on a project,
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.800]   and other mornings I might work an hour and a half.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.880]   And I'm finding that the 30 minutes really
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   makes a big difference in how much I accomplish,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560]   but that it's hard to track.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.880]   I am using the tallies, and so I can only
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.120]   track an integral number of hours worked.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.000]   Tracking minute by minute seems potentially too granular.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800]   I shouldn't really care whether I work 20 or 21 minutes,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.200]   because it might require a stopwatch or something
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   like that.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.440]   And so I'm wondering, how should I
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.840]   go about tracking deep work time in my time block planner?
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.160]   What is too granular?
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.520]   What is not granular enough?
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.680]   And how should I differentiate between 60 and 90 minutes
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.440]   of work on a given day?
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.080]   Well, there's two things at play here.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.240]   How to track time, like what granularity to track time at,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   and then the bigger question of should you track time?
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   Should you track how much time specifically you've
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   spent on different projects?
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.200]   So if we go to the first question,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.160]   let's assume we want to track time on a given project.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.280]   Let's say we want to track deep work time,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.960]   or whatever it is you're trying to track.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   The right granularity is probably 30-minute increments,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.120]   because that's the granularity, the smallest granularity
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.760]   of the time block planner.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.520]   You have hour-long blocks that are split
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.280]   into 30-minute sub-blocks.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.600]   And so that would typically be the granularity
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240]   on which I would track.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.160]   The way I would actually capture that when I was doing deep work
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.560]   tallies, if it ended up on a 30-minute multiple,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.080]   like it ended up on 3 and 1/2 hours,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.040]   I would draw a hash mark that was half the height
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.080]   of the other ones.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.160]   So you could actually have a half.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.320]   Now, one of the nice things about time block planning
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.080]   is you should format different blocks different ways.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.200]   So let's say what you want to tabulate
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.680]   is how long you spent on deep work.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.160]   You should, like I do, for example,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.720]   I color in a deep border, a thick border,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.040]   around my deep work block.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.880]   So now when I glance at my schedule,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   I can actually just see visually how much deep work
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.840]   did I do that day.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240]   Oh, there was a two-hour block here and a 30-minute block
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.960]   there.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.240]   It almost makes putting the metrics redundant,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.400]   though it is nice to kind of have a number up there.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.480]   So that's the other thing I would recommend.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.800]   The bigger point I want to make, however,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.400]   is that I find myself doing less hour tracking of that type,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.600]   less so than I used to.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.160]   So it used to be one of my main metrics was deep work hours.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   I wanted to see how much of it I was doing.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.480]   Multiscale planning, when embraced fully,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   makes that also a little bit unnecessary.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   So if you have a vision that informs a quarterly plan, that
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720]   informs your weekly plan, and that weekly plan then
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600]   informs your daily plan, you're putting aside
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200]   the right amount of time for those things for that week.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.840]   You are doing that during the weekly planning process.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's when you have a book you're working on.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.480]   You're looking at your week and figuring out,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.400]   when do I actually want to work on that book?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.920]   I want to spend all day Tuesday morning because that's free.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   And then I'm going to do an hour after work on Thursday,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   hour after work on Friday.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   Whatever it is, you're making a plan
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.280]   that makes the most sense for the reality of your schedule
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   and for what's actually important on your plate.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.700]   And then when you get to each day,
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.960]   you're using that weekly plan to build your actual time block
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.480]   plan.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.120]   I find when I'm really leaning into multiscale planning,
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.400]   I don't really need to know how many hours of deep work
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.720]   that I do.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.360]   That's an important leading indicator
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.600]   if you're not giving a lot of thought
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.240]   to how your week is going to shape up.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   So it's a inducement.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.600]   Hey, make sure you get deep work hours in if you can,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   because you want that number to be not too small.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.160]   And I get that.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.960]   But the next level of sophistication
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.680]   I found is that when you really trust yourself to go from vision
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.880]   to quarter to week to day, you gave a lot of thought
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.320]   to what the right amount of deep work is.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.360]   And if you're actually executing your daily plans,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   that work is getting executed.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.760]   So you don't also need to track it, because guess what?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.140]   Some weeks are going to have much smaller amount of deep
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.120]   work than others.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.600]   Some weeks are going to be really leaning
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.760]   into something logistical.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   Other weeks, the whole thing will
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   be dedicated to deep work.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.960]   And the individual number might not be that important.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   So that's the bigger point I want to make here
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.600]   is I do like tracking deep work hours.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.680]   I used to do that, but I don't anymore.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.920]   Because if you're doing multi-scale planning properly,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   you don't need to be forcing yourself or inducing yourself
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.880]   or motivating yourself to do work
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.160]   with those particular metrics.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.800]   Really, the only metric that matters is, did I follow my plan?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.420]   Did I look at my weekly plan and actually build out and follow
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.180]   a time block plan?
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.680]   So maybe that will alleviate some of the concern
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.920]   you're having about accurately capturing
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   all the different places you do deep work.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.300]   If you trust your plan, you can trust
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.960]   that you're getting the right amount of work done.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.900]   (upbeat music)
