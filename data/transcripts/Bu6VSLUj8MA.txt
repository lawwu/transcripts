[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   What did you guys think of yesterday's all-in episode?
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.200]   I was just astonished to hear you guys fight about us for the first 15 minutes of the pod.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160]   And I haven't listened to the rest, frankly.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   Wait a second.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.660]   I'll drop it at midnight.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.480]   Well, since Jason won't talk, I'm going to jump in.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.920]   I was super dissatisfied with Jason's performance as moderator with that last episode.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.300]   He's back to his old ways of constant annoying interruptions, but it's not done in an even-handed way.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.840]   You know, like I said, Jason, you missed it, so I'm going to repeat it.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.240]   Chamath gets to go on and on, you know, casually talking.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.060]   You know, he's wearing his linen Italian shirt with no buttons.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.960]   And he's got all the time in the world to make his points.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.500]   And then I speak for, like, five seconds, and I can't even – I said, look,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.060]   I've got three points to make about everything.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.460]   I couldn't even get through number two without you interrupting me.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.120]   And so then, you know, Freebird complains that I'm, like, getting reduced to soundbite – soundbites.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.040]   Well, the reason I'm reduced to fucking soundbites is you won't let me talk.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.100]   So it's like I have to figure out what I'm going to say in the shortest possible burst
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.800]   just to, like, get my points in edgewise, you know.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.220]   And then, by the way –
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.740]   I feel that way.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.000]   When you're speaking on the podcast, when any of us –
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.840]   when you're speaking on the podcast, I personally also feel like there's, like, a bear trap,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.260]   and you're waiting for the bear trap to close.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.200]   It's Jason's mouth.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.420]   And it's about what the next thing is going to – you know.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.900]   Yeah, I can see you – you don't normally talk that fast in real life.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.980]   I can see you speeding up your word speed because, you know, you've got this idiot moderator
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.400]   who's going to cut you off.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.060]   Yeah, it makes me anxious.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.860]   Why can't I bottle on?
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.380]   Yeah, guys, go start your own fucking podcast and be solo.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.180]   There he is.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.520]   Yes.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.920]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Cal, we're the stars.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.460]   We're the stars of the podcast.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.760]   You're just the moderator.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.560]   You're just the moderator.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.520]   All right, all right.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.400]   Listen, you go and you guys start the 2AI podcast, and you moderate each other,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.520]   and you can just monologue.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.700]   You can just sketch G-E-T-G-E-3.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.180]   Guess what?
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.120]   Guess what?
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.000]   I started a whole podcasting app.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.020]   It's called Call In.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.720]   Yeah, okay.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   Whoa.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.640]   I am –
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.920]   It's a fucking call.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   It's crashed seven times on the first fucking call.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.320]   Who's coding this shit?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.360]   Yeah, well, we're on –
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.900]   It's called Test Flight.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.920]   We're in beta.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.940]   It's called Test Flight.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.800]   You're our guinea pig.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.140]   You're our guinea pig.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.960]   Let's do it.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.660]   I'll tell you what.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.480]   You want to talk shit?
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.980]   Listen, I'm going to set up two GPT-3s, and I'm going to have one David 1 and one David 2,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.660]   and then I'm going to have them talk to each other.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.340]   And then I'll make sure it doesn't interrupt each other,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.360]   and we'll see if it gets higher ratings than the two of you guys complaining about me moderating.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.480]   I am playing the role of the audience.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   When I interrupt you, it's because you're being fabulously boring,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.340]   or there's an opportunity to make a joke.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.540]   So does that mean –
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.120]   One of those two.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.980]   Is Chamath –
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.300]   I don't agree with that.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.320]   I mean, honestly, I don't agree with that because you're not even handling your interruptions.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.380]   Okay, Dylan, it's above your pay grade.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.320]   Put yourself on mute, please.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   Thank you.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.500]   Take it easy, Dylan.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.580]   We want you to try –
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.740]   Pay grade is $0, by the way.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.940]   Yeah, $0.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.920]   I think Saks is paying you through Bitcoin or Ethereum or something.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.840]   I know he's sending you Doge to influence your edits.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.920]   I'm just trying to get to the bottom of why you don't respect Saks' points,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.800]   but Chamath can ramble on for hours on end.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.080]   Wow.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.440]   You know, actually, I think Chamath is falling behind,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.780]   and I think because of the – my theory is the all-in stats account is now resulting,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.180]   it's gotten inside Chamath's head that he's a ball hog,
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.740]   and now he's just backed off 20% every episode, so now it's in his head.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.000]   And this is also happening with the two Davids.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.820]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.280]   They're all in their own heads about –
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.620]   Chamath was a total ball hog last episode.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.560]   I mean –
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.140]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.900]   No, it was true.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.160]   Okay, so the top issue on the pod was Eric Adams.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.740]   You talk, he talks like three times,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.720]   and then you guys move on without even giving me or Freeberg the chance to add.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.000]   Because we know your opinion.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.820]   Your opinion is more cops.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.540]   More guns.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.480]   Yeehaw.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.420]   We get your opinion.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.960]   We know it.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.920]   We don't have to ask you.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.800]   No, you know, you moved on without even giving me a chance to weigh in.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.300]   How's that good moderation?
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.560]   How's that good moderation?
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.520]   And by the way –
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.540]   You don't lie.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.560]   By the way – hold on a second.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.020]   By the way, the fact that Eric Adams won –
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.040]   We're the number one pod.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.540]   You could not have predicted that.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.040]   You could not have predicted that.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.840]   Nobody else in the pod would have predicted it.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.680]   I predicted it because for six months I've been saying that's the number one political issue in America.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.200]   I deserved a victory lap on that point.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.680]   You didn't.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.840]   You just moved – you just blew right past it without even giving me a chance to weigh in on my signature issue.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.120]   Pump the brakes, Tucker.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.220]   Pump the brakes, Tucker.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.360]   That's my signature issue.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.900]   Why wouldn't you give me a chance to weigh in?
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.240]   All right.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.040]   Okay.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.820]   Okay, Ringo.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.200]   We'll let you sing a song.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.580]   Okay?
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.280]   Take it easy.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.840]   Listen.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.680]   We're the number one tech podcast when we drop an episode.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.600]   It's working.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   My moderation is working.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.240]   Your contribution is working.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.280]   Your moderation is spotty.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.340]   It's spotty.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.700]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.680]   How much better than number one do you need us to be?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.740]   Okay?
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.760]   No, I'm saying that some episodes is good.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.800]   I'm saying some episodes is good.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.480]   I think the last episode sucked in terms of your moderation.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.100]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.000]   All right.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.420]   Okay.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.060]   Thanks, Coach.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.040]   The fact is –
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.820]   By the way, the reason why we need Henry Belcaster is – no, from my standpoint, Henry Belcaster and Dylan are a necessity.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.380]   Why?
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.700]   Because we can put together my takes editing out your interruptions.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.640]   So, in other words, we can –
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.300]   We can reconstruct.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.100]   We can reconstruct what I wanted to say.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.960]   They do a repair job.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.220]   It's a repair job around your city moderation.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.140]   Sacks, it is a little suspicious how many times you have to say my full name.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.340]   It's under the contract.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.180]   Under the contract, you have to say his full name.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.040]   I don't know.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.640]   It's like you're trying –
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.820]   All right.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.080]   Listen.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.500]   David, I'm sorry that you're hurt that I interrupt you or make fun of you.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.800]   I just want to say you look great.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.380]   Your plant diet is working.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.980]   And I am right now on a 14-hour fast.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.480]   And I look at that bacon.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.060]   I'm looking at the bacon and eggs and the toast my kids are having this morning.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.780]   And you know what I said?
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.600]   I got to drop at least two pounds by the next all-in podcast.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.160]   So, it's working.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.080]   So, congratulations.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.100]   I shamed you into stopping.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.260]   All right.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.800]   Well, thank you.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.940]   And by the way, by the way, I mean, wait.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.840]   This is another thing that didn't get – we didn't really unpackage this.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.340]   But you're a 10-pounder.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.440]   You're a 10-pounder.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   You're a 10 pounds heavier than me.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.020]   Are you not?
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.980]   That's not a lie.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.240]   You said you're –
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.660]   Yeah, I am.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.840]   I am.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.640]   I don't know why I look better.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.880]   I can't understand it either.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.240]   I look so much better than you.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   You're half an inch shorter and 10 pounds heavier.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.260]   Yet, I still look better.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.940]   It's crazy.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.520]   I agree.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.960]   Henry, that's a soundbite you should turn into a little clip.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.800]   If only this app allowed you to have high-quality, high-fidelity sound, you could actually work
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.400]   with these clips.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.760]   J.K.L., aren't you a big investor in this app?
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.380]   Yeah, I'm a minor investor.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.740]   I'm a minor investor, but I'm happy to be along for the ride.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.720]   And I will promote the shit out of this app once it's out there since Clubhouse blocked
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.880]   me from investing.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.260]   So anything to kill Clubhouse and help tax.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.060]   Hey, speaking –
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.760]   I'll do.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.840]   Speaking of weight, are any of you investors in this tonal machine thing?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.580]   I'm not, but I own one, and it's great.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.440]   It's great.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.980]   I love it.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.600]   It's nuts.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.680]   I use it all the time.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   Hey, we got to talk about this censorship because we made a clip for David Sachs.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.220]   All right.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.500]   All right.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.620]   Once again, Dylan.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.860]   What's your opinion?
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.900]   We're going to throw it to you.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.480]   Mute yourself.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.020]   You're not the moderator here.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.420]   Nobody gives a shit about your opinion.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.800]   Jason, Jason.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.000]   Jason, what's your height and weight?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.340]   I think we might have to have a boxing match.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.360]   All right, Dylan.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.380]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.040]   Once again, Dylan and Henry, stay in your lane.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.900]   Both of you put yourself on mute.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.940]   This is our episode.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.660]   Then I'm gone.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.720]   What's beautiful –
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.140]   Bye, guys.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.000]   Nice seeing you.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.460]   Mute yourself or else I leave.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.260]   Okay.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.860]   Three, two –
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.440]   It's a takeover.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.260]   It's a takeover.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.360]   It's a takeover.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.320]   Thank you.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.220]   Thank you, boys.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.460]   Jesus Christ.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.080]   Now, besties, back to the topic at hand.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.680]   Don't empower these two guys too much, okay?
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.640]   Dylan and Henry, you do a great job, but you're not besties.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.560]   You're not moderators.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.780]   You're not on the show, okay?
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.680]   You're the whack pack.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.360]   You're talented.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.200]   J. Kel, you're the whack pack.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.660]   Your 16-hour fast is making you a little cranky.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.520]   Fucking Baba Booey's over here.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.100]   That high-pitched Eric.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.600]   Brutal.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.240]   Baba Booey.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.140]   Baba Booey.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.200]   Baba Booey.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.840]   You guys think they're running the show all of a sudden.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.040]   Jesus Christ.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.960]   This is what happens when you mention them by name at the top of the show.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.120]   Listen, guys.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.940]   Collect all of the money from the other podcasters.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:15.460]   Just double your fees every three months and ride on David's praising you and me praising you.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.720]   We're happy to watch you price gouge the other podcasts.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.820]   But they do good work.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.160]   I agree.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.860]   They do good work.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.900]   All right.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.040]   Is there anything you want to talk about, David?
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.180]   Other than criticizing my moderation, which people love and we make people laugh.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.340]   If I didn't interrupt you and laugh, there wouldn't be that tension on the show.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.400]   People are waiting for me to interrupt and make a joke.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.200]   I think there should be a clock where I'm allowed a certain amount of time before you interrupt.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.040]   Just tell me what it is.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.840]   30 seconds.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.020]   You know?
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.260]   Seven seconds.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.680]   Seven seconds.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   Ten seconds.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.220]   Just tell me what it is so I know.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.980]   Yeah, but I don't know when you're going to give me an opening to make.
