[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.200]   money and travel. If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins. And hello, or maybe
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.120]   bonjour, Jean Boc, Konichiwa, Annyeonghaseyo, Hola, Laurana. How many do I have here? Maybe
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.240]   Marhaba, Shalom, Nihao. That's probably all I've got right now, but I am sure my guest
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.120]   today has many more covered. Benny Lewis is a language hacker and self-taught polyglot
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.440]   who can speak a dozen languages. He also runs the world's largest language learning blog
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.760]   called Fluent in Three Months and is a best-selling author of six language learning books. I am
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.000]   really excited for today's conversation. We're going to talk about his practical approach
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.080]   that would help anyone, regardless of age or whether they have that language learning
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.160]   gene, learn and speak new languages through better, faster and more efficient ways. We'll
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.580]   also talk about what makes languages easy or hard to learn, how technology has impacted
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.840]   language learning, how to think about learning a language before going abroad, and so much
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.600]   more. There's going to be so much content in this episode. I can't wait for you to hear
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.360]   it. So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.920]   In the past two months, I feel like we've really leveled up the dinner experience in
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.040]   our home. That's a combo of the ease of cooking, the cost, and most importantly, the variety,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.340]   quality and taste of our food. And it's because I don't think there's been a single week this
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.960]   summer that we've been in town and haven't ordered a meal kit from Green Chef. And I'm
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.680]   so excited to be partnering with them for this episode. And just to be clear, other
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.520]   than a one-time sample kit, we've been paying the regular price for Green Chef each week
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.140]   and have no plans to stop. One of the main reasons I love Green Chef is that they focus
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.720]   on making eating well so easy. They have nutritionist-approved recipes each week. And if you're looking for
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.280]   something keto, paleo, vegan, vegetarian, or even gluten-free, they support all that
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.500]   as well with 80-plus weekly options to choose from. And they also have energizing, nutritious
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.200]   breakfast options and easy 10-minute lunches that you can add on to make the entire week
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.080]   even easier. So if you want to eat clean the easy way with recipes that can help manage
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.840]   weight or support your wellness goals without skimping on flavor, you have to check out
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.240]   Green Chef. And specifically, you've got to check out the Thai Chicken Curry and the Crispy
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   Tilapia with Ginger Lime Peanut Sauce, which were both delicious. Just go to allthehacks.com/greenchef

[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.400]   Benny, I'm so jealous you're joining from South Korea. Thank you for being here.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   Yeah, it's a pleasure. Thanks for having me.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.800]   To kick us off, I want to understand, coming from the States, I feel like there just aren't
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.200]   as many people interested in learning a language as I wish there were. And I'm curious what
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.020]   you think some of the common challenges or misconceptions there are that might be holding
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020]   people back.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.540]   Well, I myself had the misconception. I didn't grow up speaking other languages. I was only
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.120]   speaking English when I was 21. I actually studied electronic engineering. So I definitely
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   understand coming from the background of I'm not good at languages. Especially if you go
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   into a technical field, it's very tempting to get this whole left brain right brain concept
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.480]   in your mind, where you're either good at technical things, like I was good at mathematics
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.920]   and the sciences. And then I decided because of that, I'm bad at the arts and languages.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.860]   And I created a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I would see failure and say to myself
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.020]   and to others, that's proof that I am destined to never learn a language. And I could list
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.080]   a million examples of where I failed an exam in school or even moved to Spain after I graduated.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.280]   And I lived there for six months and I did not learn Spanish for those six months.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.600]   I totally understand coming from a monolingual English country that you just think to yourself,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.640]   I don't have the language gene. Other people have it. I don't have it. Or I did not grow
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.600]   up speaking a language. So it's too late. I'm past whatever the cutoff age is for learning
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.000]   a language. And a lot of people say these things to themselves. And that truly is a
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.960]   self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you embrace these reasons that you're going to fail, the
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   more you essentially make them true.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.760]   And I always like to think what Henry Ford said once, whether you think you can or think
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.560]   you can't, you're right. And I think that's very true with language learning.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.360]   And what changed for you?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   So after those first failed six months living in Spain, I was telling myself more and more,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.280]   it was just giving me more fuel for this, you suck at languages fire. One of the things
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.920]   that challenged that was I was telling myself the technical thing, you're an engineer, engineers
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.960]   don't learn languages. But I was on this exchange program that had a lot of other engineers
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   coming into Spain and they would arrive not speaking any Spanish. But after a few months,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.780]   a lot of them would actually be speaking some level of Spanish. So this challenged this
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.900]   belief that I had. So I decided to experiment. I tried a few things and a lot of them were
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.160]   huge flops. That's another thing I know a lot of your listeners, perhaps in the past,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.440]   have attempted to learn a language. It was a failure. And they say, that's proof that
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.240]   I'm just destined to never speak it. I had a lot of those failures beyond the failures
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.280]   in school. While I was living in Spain, I went to a group class and I was worse than
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.400]   the class. The teacher would turn to me, ask me a question and I would say, see, and hope
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   maybe that's right. And it was never right. She was asking me how old you are or whatever.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.240]   I had to keep experimenting and keep failing until I found an approach that works for me.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   I am absolutely convinced that there is nobody in the entire world that cannot learn a second
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.000]   language. But what is true is there are many approaches that are completely inefficient
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.960]   for a lot of people. In my case, the academic approach of learning like I did in school,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.560]   sitting in a classroom with 30 other people and having a teacher talk at us, that just
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.640]   does not work for me. In that environment, I am a terrible language learner. So I think
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.520]   it's okay for people to say, using this particular approach, I am a bad language learner, but
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   that does not mean you will never learn a language. Maybe you need to find that approach.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.740]   After all these failed experiments of multiple attempts to learn language in ways that did
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.520]   not work for me, my last experiment was, I'm going to try and just speak Spanish all the
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.620]   time outside of my work because I was teaching English. So obviously I had to speak English.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.460]   As soon as I walked outside the door of the school, I would only speak Spanish. And my
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.560]   Spanish was absolutely abysmal. This was caveman Spanish of like barely a few dozen words.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.920]   And I decided to use it anyway. I pushed through this extremely frustrating stage and there's
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.260]   literally a moment that everything changed for me when I was still broke at the time
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.080]   and I just bought an electric toothbrush and it broke on me. And I was so mad about it.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.580]   I wanted a refund. So I charged into the shop that I had bought it in, ready to demand my
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.120]   money back. And then I realized when I went up to the manager, I don't know how to say
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.360]   refund. I don't know how to say toothbrush. I don't know how to say broken.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   So I was like, máquina de dientes malo, tooth machine bad, dinero y de vuelta, money round
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.920]   trip. And it was absolutely wrong. If I was sitting an exam in an academic context, I
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.760]   would have failed this, try to ask for a refund for a toothbrush test. But you know what?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.480]   I got my money back. And that just blew my mind that maybe I don't need to be perfect
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.000]   in Spanish or I don't need to have a high level in Spanish. I just need to communicate.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.320]   And I think that's something that a lot of people could embrace. This idea of instead
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.000]   of thinking that every mistake you make is a big red X on an exam paper, bringing you
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.680]   closer to a fail. Every mistake is just you trying to communicate. And the gauge of success
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.800]   is are you understood? And do you get the gist of what they're saying back to you?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.560]   This is a lot more nebulous and leaves a lot more room for you to have some form of success.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.520]   And once I saw that, I started to lower the bar on what counts for success. And that gave
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.840]   me a lot of wins to push my Spanish forward. I think a lot of people have their head a
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   bit too much on this very distant long term goal that you want to master the language.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.000]   And I have reached that stage. I have a C2 diploma in the likes of Spanish. I worked
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.480]   as a professional translator. I have reached this high level stage. But when I'm in language
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.560]   learning mode, I decide to embrace the fact that I'm a beginner, try to have fun with
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.520]   it, try to accept my limitations and just decide my goal is to make a lot of mistakes.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   And that's how I'm going to make progress. That completely transformed my entire language
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   learning life.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's funny. I haven't had to learn a language since learning a similar lesson in a different
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.760]   way. We've had three au pairs stay with us speaking Spanish and Italian. And I don't
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.960]   speak Spanish or Italian. They have more English knowledge than we did in other languages.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.680]   As a person on the other side of this, when someone says something wrong, you don't think,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.160]   "Oh my gosh, this person got it all wrong." You just communicate.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.680]   And when someone says, "Take car school", you know what they're saying. It's grammatically
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.060]   incorrect, but it doesn't matter. I've watched three people, their English constantly improves
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.520]   without me teaching them lessons. They're just hearing my responses.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.440]   I haven't tried to pick up a language since having them here, but it's made me a lot more
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.760]   confident than I think that perfectionism bug I had. And that probably comes from school,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.320]   right? Failing tests because I didn't know specific words or gosh, the number of times
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.400]   learning French, messing up on the gender of a word. It felt like that was the only
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.080]   thing I was trying to learn was conjugation and gender, but I'm not even convinced you
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   need them well to communicate at a basic level.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   No, you don't. Because like you said, people are flexible and you do learn those things.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.220]   So it's not like I'm saying, "Make these mistakes." A lot of people would say, "What about fossilization?
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.840]   The mistake will stay with you forever." It doesn't. You'll practice and eventually you'll
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.440]   find tricks that work for remembering conjugation and remembering what the gender of certain
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.280]   nouns are. You start to internalize those things, but they're less important at the
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.120]   start. And it's like you said, people have this idea of the spotlight effect. Everyone
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.740]   is looking at me. Everyone is judging me. And whenever I try to speak the language,
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.800]   they're all laughing at how much of an idiot I am because I use the wrong conjugation.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   That's not how the real world works. Most people are patient. Most people want you to
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.400]   succeed. And if you say a broken sentence that gets the point across, but is grammatically
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.680]   incorrect, you're not talking to a computer that's going to spit out an error message.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.880]   You're talking to a human being and they're going to understand you. They're going to
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.520]   interpret what you're saying and the conversation will move forward.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:29.040]   This perfectionism does not work in the context of languages. It's unfortunate because languages
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   are exposed to us in an academic situation at first. That's our context. It is an academic
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:41.320]   thing. Every mistake you make is a problem. But in the real world, I like to think language
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.560]   is can't be learned for real. Languages can only be lived. And this is the attitude I
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.240]   try to take to it. I try to think of it more like a sport that I'm practicing and getting
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.040]   better at. If you're doing any kind of sport, you're not going to get punished if you don't
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.320]   have a perfect game on day one.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.360]   That's not how it works. You get better progressively with time. I think it's a lot better to think
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.240]   of languages in that context rather than academically, because perfectionism is the worst enemy
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:17.280]   of all in language learning. It will absolutely defeat any sense of progress you're going
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.760]   to make. It's going to destroy your ego. You have to let go of your ego a lot in language
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.880]   learning and decide. I sound like an idiot right now, and I'm OK with that.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.720]   It's very humbling. I do it over and over again. I'm doing it right now with Korean
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.320]   and it's kicking my ass again. Even though I have a high level in other languages, I'm
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   an idiot once again. And because I'm OK with being an idiot, that's why I can learn the
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   languages.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.720]   First off, I think there are probably some people listening right now that are like,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.760]   "Wow, maybe I actually do know enough Spanish or French or German or whatever I picked up
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.360]   in school to actually use it." If you're that person, I'm excited for you. I hope you get
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.560]   a chance to forget a lot of these things.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.840]   Definitely want to talk more about the practice of picking up a language for people who haven't
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.400]   even started. But I know there's a common belief that adults are not as good as language
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.200]   learners as children. Do you think there's any age limit to this?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.080]   So this comes back to what I was saying before about approach. The approach dictates how
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.320]   successful you're going to be. When I was researching this a long time ago, I came across
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:26.000]   a study in the University of Haifa in Israel that found that under the right circumstances,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.740]   adults are better language learners than children. That sounds very counterintuitive because
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.360]   all the evidence we see out there is children are clearly learning languages more than adults
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:42.200]   are. And it's because it's not under the right circumstances for those adults. The adults
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.660]   are taking dusty old grammar books. The adults are going to group classes where they're zipping
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.680]   it and letting a teacher talk at them. The adults are not truly living through the language.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.320]   The adults don't have any friends in the language. They're not playing games in the language
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.600]   like a child does. And a child has a better language learning approach. It's not that
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.840]   they are better at language learning. You could argue both points. You could argue why
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.520]   children are better. They have more neuroplasticity. Their brains are open to more things. But
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.360]   ultimately there are a lot of advantages adults have. We have complete control for the most
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.200]   part over our days, our lives. We can decide where we're going, what we're doing with our
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   free time, a lot more than a child can. A child may learn a language, but a child cannot
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.800]   decide I want to learn Chinese. That's not going to happen for that child unless the
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   parents decide, okay, I'm going to help you do that. I'm going to put you in the right
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.840]   environment or whatever. So we have a lot more control over the situation, but I understand
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.280]   there's a lot of baggage that comes with things. As an adult, letting go of that baggage is
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.080]   very difficult. That will slow us down. So there is a certain mental hill that you have
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.340]   to climb that does make it harder for adults. I think a lot of us have fallen into this
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.320]   perfectionist trap and that makes it harder because children are not perfectionists. When
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.160]   you think of any child learning their native language, they make a million mistakes and
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   they're fine with it. We can take inspiration from children, but absolutely there is no
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.560]   cutoff age. There is no age where you cannot learn a language. The only thing you'll find
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.880]   when you dig really deep into this is maybe there's an age where it becomes a lot more
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.680]   difficult to become bilingual. That is absolutely a problem you may want to solve or try to
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.800]   solve, but honestly, who cares? I am not bilingual in any of my languages. I am at a mastery
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.520]   level. Everything I can do in English I can do in Spanish, but I still have an accent.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.840]   I still make the odd mistake and there might be like an obscure word here or there that
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.400]   I don't know. I'm not bilingual. You're not going to confuse me for a native speaker,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.160]   but I'm close enough that I can function like a native speaker would, and that's fine. Maybe
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.040]   there's an age where if I'd started learning Spanish before that, I could change that gap,
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.280]   but who cares? It doesn't matter. I'm not trying to become a spy. I don't want people
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.680]   to think that I'm from Spain so I can fool them. I'm from Ireland. I'm proud of I'm from
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.320]   Ireland. If I've got a little bit of an accent, it has that sense of charm to it, so I'm okay
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:23.440]   with not being bilingual. Once you accept that, then this whole cutoff age becomes irrelevant.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.080]   That's where the cutoff age is. It's for bilingual fluency in a language. I have come across
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:35.120]   exceptions. I have found adults who can become essentially the same as a native speaker even
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.600]   though they learned it later in life, but I wouldn't necessarily say that's something
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.920]   you could scale to a lot of other people easily. The goal should be fluency. If you can function
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.960]   the same in your target language like you would in English, then that's all you ever
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   need. You're good with what you can do, and that is something every adult in the world
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   can absolutely do. Given the caveat, there is a lot of work they have to do ahead of
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.240]   time in terms of mental changes and learning what the right approach is and so on.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.520]   So, I want to come back to some of those mental changes. It just made me think of something.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.040]   Right before I came to this interview, I told my daughter, who's about to turn three, "Oh,
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.480]   I'm going to go record a podcast, so I'm going to miss your bedtime tonight. It's going to
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   be about languages." I was like, "How many languages do you speak?" She was like, "I
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.320]   speak Italian, I speak English, and I speak Spanish." She maybe knows 50 words of Spanish
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.120]   and Italian, but in her mind, she speaks it. It just crossed my mind that I could probably
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.840]   speak thousands of words of French. I could get along in the country by myself, no problem.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.220]   Probably not fluent, but I'm comfortable enough to speak. And I don't actually consider myself
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.360]   someone who speaks French. I can speak French. So, that confidence to just feel like you're
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.040]   already there. You mentioned the sports example. My parents are not going to be on the World
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.680]   Cup field ever, but they could stand on the ground and kick a soccer ball. They can play
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.200]   soccer, just not at any level that would be fun to watch, or maybe fun to watch for a
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.720]   different reason.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.220]   When it comes to building wealth, taxes are such a big part of the strategy. And even
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.360]   if you've already filed, being proactive about this year to lower your future liability
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.700]   is so important. And now that I'm working with Gelt, I finally feel like I have a partner
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.880]   I can trust to handle everything for my business and personal taxes. And I'm excited to partner
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.520]   with them for this episode. Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA. They not only
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.500]   offer an amazing tech platform that gives you personalized guidance to maximize deductions,
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:35.040]   tax credits, and savings, but also everything is backed by an in-house team of expert CPAs
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.960]   who can recommend the most effective tax strategies to minimize risk and grow your wealth. And
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.280]   best of all, you can have this transparent, open communication with your team in whatever
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.320]   way works best for you, whether that's on their platform, over email, in Slack, or scheduling
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   a call.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.120]   Finally, my favorite story is that when we first onboarded with Gelt, they reviewed our
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.080]   past returns and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made. So, they refiled and got
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.920]   us back all that money. So, if you're ready for a more premium, proactive tax strategy
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.600]   to optimize and file your taxes, you have to check out Gelt. And as an AllTheHacks listener,

[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.360]   It's one thing to say, so you'd have to get over that fear. Are there any hacks or tips
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.480]   you've developed or helped people with to get over those nerves and get over the need
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480]   to be a perfectionist?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:53.160]   Yeah, I mean, the biggest hack I can give to everybody is you have to speak your target
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:00.440]   language from day one. I think one big mental barrier people have is they decide I'm going
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.720]   to study the language for a certain amount of time. Maybe that's a few months, maybe
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.680]   it's a year, a New Year's resolution. I'm going to learn Spanish. So one year from now,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.300]   I will have reached that magic moment when I can finally walk up to a native speaker
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:20.720]   and speak Spanish to them. And I think that is a fool's errand, because this creates a
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.440]   new situation in your head where you have to wait until you're ready, and then you can
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.520]   make all the excuses in the world that you're not ready yet, because you will never be at
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.320]   100% perfectionism in Spanish. Even when you reach the very high levels I've talked about,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.660]   there's still a couple of little things you need to polish. If you were enough of a perfectionist,
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.240]   you would never speak your target language. To throw that out the window, you have to
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   decide I'm going to speak it right away. Even though I only know 10 words, I'm still going
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.320]   to try and use it. For instance, a couple of months ago, I started doing this with Korean.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.400]   On day one, I decided I am going to get somebody on Zoom, a native Korean speaker, and I'm
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.760]   going to speak only in Korean to them. This may obviously have a lot of questions like
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.880]   how can you do that if you've literally just started to learn the language? I'll cheat
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.440]   a little bit. What I'll do is I'll have a Google Translate tab open, and I will, ahead
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.000]   of the lesson, I'll try to find a few phrases I know I'm likely to use. I'm from Ireland,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.040]   my name is, and so on. Then I'll say this to the teacher. The teacher will reply, and
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.880]   I won't understand what they said. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. One of the phrases
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.480]   I prepared is, "I'm sorry, I don't understand. Could you write that down, please?" I'll write
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.600]   that in the chat, and I can copy and paste that into Google Translate. It is a giant
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.040]   crutch. You could argue this doesn't really count as speaking the language, but the point
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.520]   is, you use these crutches like you use a stabilizer on a bike. It is giving you the
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.920]   ability to move forward, even though obviously you're not moving forward without the tool.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   With time, you'll need the crutch less and less. The stabilizers on your bike, you can
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.400]   take them off after you've learned how to get your balance and such. That is my biggest
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:14.000]   tip by far, is let go of the fact that you have to wait until you're ready, and speak
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   right now. Decide, "I'm going to get in front of somebody." This is a lot more affordable
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.400]   than people think. People imagine, I've got to book a language class, and they look in
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.560]   their hometown, and they find the language class. It's expensive, $50 an hour, but they
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:35.040]   figure, "No, it's worth the investment." The thing is, if you go on a lot of websites,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.120]   and you try to find a teacher with Spanish, who lives in literally any Latin American
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.960]   country, you can take advantage of a stronger currency exchange. You can get a really good
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:51.320]   teacher for $10 or $15 an hour, who's earning pretty decently in their country. With that,
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.440]   you have one person who is giving their undivided attention to you.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.040]   Ahead of time, I decided with my Korean teachers, "I am paying this person for patience, because
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.320]   I am going to be extremely slow. I'm going to be incredibly awkward. I am paying this
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.960]   person to be patient with me, so I don't have to feel as bad that I'm wasting their time
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.000]   or whatever, because I'm paying for their time." That takes a lot of the stress off
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.800]   me, because obviously, I'm not going to walk up to a stranger on the street, and start
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.260]   blurting my low level of the language at them, and expect anything positive to happen.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.880]   When I'm paying for somebody's time, that's different. I try to hire a teacher online.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:41.720]   There's loads of good websites. One that probably has the most teachers is italki.com. Find
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.760]   a teacher there, book them, and you just start talking with them. It's going to suck. You're
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:52.640]   going to feel like an idiot. You have to remember, you have to suck a little less every day.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:59.480]   The goal is not perfectionism. The goal is not to be a genius. The goal is not to debate
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:06.440]   Kantian epistemology in your target language. The goal is suck a little less every day.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.920]   That is essentially my biggest tip of all. If you take anything from this interview,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.240]   take that. Speak from the beginning. You're going to suck. Accept that. Embrace it, and
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.400]   just suck a tiny bit less every day, and that progressively leads to improvement.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.420]   I love it. It's very simple. You have this whole program, Fluent in Three Months. I'm
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.920]   also curious about where the three months came from. Start with that, but it has to
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.360]   be more than just continually have these conversations. Are there steps along the way that someone
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.040]   should follow learning a language?
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.120]   Yeah, okay. So the three months, I know when people would see the title of Fluent in Three
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.560]   Months, they may imagine I'm talking about a particular program that will guarantee success
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.220]   in three months, but what it's more about is specificity. So I'm not prescribing to
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:58.160]   anybody that you must do this within a certain timeline. The problem I tend to see is a lot
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.520]   of people are extremely vague with their targets. So they will make a New Year's resolution,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.560]   I want to learn Spanish, and that's it. That's all they come up with, and that has absolutely
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:15.320]   nothing attached to it. You need smart goals, specific, measurable, all that stuff. That's
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.820]   what I was thinking when I was getting started with all of this. I needed to have a specific
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:27.480]   target in a specific deadline. In my case, three months happens to work because I'm a
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.660]   nomad. I travel all the time, and when you travel, you will find a lot of countries tend
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.860]   to have a three month tourist visa limit. That's all the time I had, so that's the deadline
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.960]   I was going to give myself. Initially, I would travel to the country. Nowadays, I do it differently.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.820]   I learn the language ahead of time, before going. Then I'll spend three months in the
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.880]   country without having to be in as intensive a learning mode. Ultimately, that's where
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.520]   it came from for me, is it's a tourist visa limit, and I find it's the Goldilocks zone.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:02.140]   A year is just so much time that you can keep putting it off, decide, I'll do it once a
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.340]   week or whatever, and you might cram it at the end. Whereas a few weeks or a month is
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.460]   too little time to make any significant progress, so three months of very intensive language
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.600]   learning, if you're the kind of person who can work intensively for a particular time
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.020]   and take time off, which I know is not the case for a lot of people.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:28.560]   For me, what I would do is I would work really hard for nine months out of the year, save
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.240]   up money, and then I don't have to work so much for three months, and I make it my full-time
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.660]   job. That is not something realistic for most people, so I don't guarantee fluency in three
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.920]   months, because if you want to make a really high level in a short amount of time, it needs
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.660]   to be a full-time job. For most people, try your best to decide three months or four months
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:55.160]   or six months, whatever it is, I can make a lot of sacrifices. I can decide I'm going
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.580]   to give up English-speaking shows on Netflix for three months, and the time I would put
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.900]   into watching those shows, I'm going to study the language, or at the very least, watch
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:11.220]   the shows in that language if I need to wind down or whatever. I go out with my friends
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.420]   maybe three times a week. I'm going to cut that down to once a week or once every two
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.180]   weeks, and the extra time I'm going to put into learning the language, I'm going to make
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.640]   a lot of sacrifices in my life, and those sacrifices are going to give me more time.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.940]   Even if that's one hour a day, you utilize that one hour and decide I can't sustain this
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.700]   in the long term. Eventually, I need to relax. I need to be seeing my friends regularly,
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.180]   whatever it may be, but you decide for this short term of three months or four months
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:45.540]   or whatever specific number is realistic for you, the biggest priority in my life is learning
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.660]   this language. I'm going to eat and breathe this language. I'm going to be listening to
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.760]   podcasts about the language, reading books in the language, using apps or doing flashcards
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.340]   in the language, and of course, I'm going to be speaking the language with actual human
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:07.100]   beings via a Zoom call or whatever it may be. I'm going to do that intensively for a
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.580]   certain period of time. That's going to make a difference because a lot of people don't
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   have any solid goals with their language. They don't have any sense of intensity, and
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.460]   try to do it in whatever free time they have.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.620]   They're in a supermarket line, and they decide I'll do some Duolingo, and they've done something
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.500]   that day, and then they say, "Oh, I've done something in the language." That's not what
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.460]   I'm talking about. You need to let go of this, "I'm going to do anything for five minutes
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:40.580]   and feel like I'm doing something in the language." It needs to be a true project. That's what
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.500]   I do. I make it a project. The three months works for me because it is an amount of time
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:50.980]   that I can throw myself at a project. I start to run out of energy, and then go easy on
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.740]   myself the rest of the time. Generally, because I deal with multiple languages, I learn a
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.900]   new language for three months, but I'll be maintaining my languages for the rest of the
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.740]   year. I don't have to worry about learning a new language.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:09.940]   It's an extremely intensive burst of progress. That's what I try to help people with. I run
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:15.100]   my own coaching program. It goes over three months. It doesn't necessarily mean you have
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.060]   to have the same target as me, but when people are on the coaching program, I at least guarantee
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.580]   by the end of it, you will be conversing in the language. Conversing is a lot more flexible
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.500]   than having to be fluent, because conversing, you can still talk to someone who's patient
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.180]   and you can talk slowly, and you can make a lot more mistakes.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:39.420]   Some specific goal that works for you that might be realistic, but still pushing yourself
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:44.620]   as much as possible, that's what leads to a lot more success. That's what I see people
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.140]   not doing. People who don't succeed in learning a language, they don't have anything they're
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:55.100]   trying to reach in any timeline. So smart goals changes everything, and that's where
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.380]   the three months comes from.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.780]   Okay. So we set specific goals. We set a timeframe. I like the idea of three months to get to
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.260]   fluency might be possible, but you've got to really be intensive. Is there an amount
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.940]   of time that you think is the minimum someone needs to put in to get to that conversational
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   level?
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.020]   I think that's where you start to really see what is unique to the person. I found for
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.780]   me, I can't make progress in a language unless I'm putting at least an hour a day in. But
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.820]   I have come across a lot of people who actually can switch their brain into language learning
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:33.500]   very quickly. They can do something with 15 minute bursts. I've seen them progress over
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.840]   the longer period of time, obviously, but I have seen them progress. So this depends
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:43.440]   on the person. I'm not the kind of person that can do anything in 15 minutes. It takes
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.500]   my brain time to adapt, get used to it and get my momentum back. I personally need at
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   least an hour. And generally I try to do a few hours because I'm doing it intensively,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.460]   but I understand that's not as realistic for a lot of people in their life situations.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.380]   So depends on the person. If you're the kind of person that feels like you can make genuine
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:09.780]   progress in a 30 minute window, that may be your minimum. But of course, this is why I
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:15.020]   was saying before, the first thing you do is look at your timetable and see what can
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:21.100]   I sacrifice for these next two months or four months or whatever the number is and find
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.780]   more time. There's no magic number. One hour is the number that's going to change your
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.860]   life. Just find how much time you have because the more time you do each day, the more you're
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   going to learn.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.900]   People always ask me how long will it take me to reach this level in the language? They
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.220]   would say, Benny, your three months are crazy because I spent six years learning Spanish
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.220]   in school and I would interrupt them and say, no, you didn't. You did not spend six years
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.860]   learning Spanish. Six years elapsed through which you maybe went to a one hour Spanish
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:58.260]   class with people and you were daydreaming about a girl you had a crush on or whatever
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   it is.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.620]   It's not quite the same as intensively living and breathing this language for a certain
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.900]   period. It's why I tell people the amount of time that elapses is not what's important
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:15.460]   for counting how successful. It's more about how many hours of dedicated time are you putting
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:20.660]   into that language where it's got 100% of your attention. Any less attention is going
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:27.420]   to give less important results. You can listen to a podcast while you're doing the dishes.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.860]   You can do something at the same time and it is going to help you, but it's going to
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:37.300]   be less useful. So I would say an hour of listening to a podcast while you're doing
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:44.100]   other tasks is equivalent to maybe 10 minutes of actually giving it your undivided attention,
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.700]   replaying the audio, taking notes.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.780]   It's why it's a very nebulous thing to decide how much time do I need because it depends
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.600]   so much on how you're using that time. This is why I tell people, don't worry if you've
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.920]   spent six years or whatever, I'm the same. In school, I had learned a German for six
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:08.380]   years and at the end of those six years, I couldn't do anything. I went to Germany and
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.140]   I couldn't order a train ticket. And that was literally one of the things in my lessons
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.600]   that kept coming up, how to order a train ticket. And I couldn't even do that. I say
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.780]   that I learned German for six years, but I didn't learn German for six years. German
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:28.460]   learning happened in my schedule where I was in that class, but it wasn't six years. Three
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:34.260]   intensive months. That is a whole different universe compared to what we think of for
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:40.420]   language learning in a very casual or passive way. You really need to take active control
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.620]   and it needs to be a priority in your life. And you could do a lot more in a shorter time
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.620]   period.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.020]   I love it.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   Our next partner has a product I literally use every day. I started taking AG-1 from
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.540]   Athletic Greens because I wanted an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance and
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.140]   optimize my immune system. And it's been in my routine for almost a year because when
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:06.500]   you take one scoop of AG-1, you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   food source, super foods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.100]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.140]   cold and head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a feeling
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.220]   I absolutely love. I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar and no GMOs, nasty
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:32.220]   chemicals or artificial anything. To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.500]   to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel

[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.340]   So you mentioned the example of it's really important to start speaking early on and there's
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.780]   ways that you could do it a lot more affordably. And it's really important how you spend the
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:39.740]   time. What are the things that are important to spend your time on aside from native speaking
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:45.780]   with another human? Is it vocabulary? Is it writing? Is it reading? What are the core
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.660]   elements in that three month period of what you need to be doing?
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.420]   I would definitely understand. This is one of the first questions people ask me is what
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.660]   is the best app for learning a language? What are the best books I can buy? What should
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:03.260]   I be doing with my time in terms of vocabulary and all that? I have to say, I don't want
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.580]   to sound like a broken record, but the biggest thing you should be thinking about is speaking
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:14.180]   with a human being. That should be the center of gravity. Everything else is building upon
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.940]   that. Every day I try to have a lesson with a teacher or if I'm less intensive, maybe
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:25.260]   a couple of times a week. And then everything else that I'm doing is to augment that experience
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.460]   with my teacher.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.260]   Maybe after the class passes, I think to myself, man, I really suck at vocabulary. You have
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:37.900]   to do sort of a triage system. You imagine a hospital where all these sick people are
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.420]   coming in. There's a million problems to deal with, but the guy with the runny nose is not
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.300]   as important as the guy with the gunshot wound. You have to do this with your language learning.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.100]   And yes, of course, you could think, oh, my accent sucks. Oh my God, I'm not conjugating
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:57.060]   my verbs, or I don't know the right gender of these nouns. But none of that makes a big
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:03.180]   difference with actual communication. I guarantee you when you're speaking languages and you
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.940]   mess up the gender, 99.99% of the time they will understand you regardless.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   People always cite, oh, but there's this one really specific example that if you switch
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   the gender it means something different. That doesn't happen almost ever. For most cases,
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:27.220]   when you say in German "der" instead of "die" or you say "el" instead of "la" in Spanish,
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.300]   they understand what you mean. You have to start thinking of other things. Basic vocabulary.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.940]   I'm going to do in my spare time, not because that's going to help me with some vague future
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:43.300]   of like generally improving my Spanish. I'm a lot more short term cited and I'm thinking,
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:49.060]   what can I do to make my next experience tomorrow or next week, if that's my next class, what
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.740]   am I going to do to make that slightly better in the language? So maybe then I will learn
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:00.260]   some vocabulary. And I'm a big fan of using flashcards because they integrate the spaced
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.380]   repetition system. They space it out to make sure you're remembering the vocabulary just
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.540]   before you would potentially forget it. For that, I use an app Anki, A-N-K-I, but I know
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   for a lot of people it has a very simple interface, which works for me, but there's other apps
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.940]   that have notification sounds, a prettier interface that may be a bit more manageable
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.900]   for people. There's a bunch of apps that you can use. Which one you use isn't really as
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.540]   important as the fact that you are deciding how is this going to help my spoken sessions?
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.140]   I'm not the kind of person who says you must download this app. You must get this specific
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.260]   book because these are incidental. I will just literally find whatever book, I'll just
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.780]   walk into a bookshop wherever I happen to be and pick up that one. Obviously, except
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.700]   for my books, those are the books people should be buying first. But that being said, you
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.940]   just buy some language course and make sure you're doing stuff with your teacher and your
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:03.260]   teacher will help you decide a bit more directionally what you need to put your time into. I do
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.340]   understand people always want to know what is the app, what is the book? All of these
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:15.260]   will be 1% to 5% contributing to your success compared to are you finding a human being
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.100]   and speaking with them regularly? My focus is way more in that direction. In terms of
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.700]   what you're doing in the long term, you can't speak your way to fluency. You're not going
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.180]   to speak every day and then eventually end up at fluency. I have a bit more of a dynamic
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:34.460]   learning approach. At the beginning, it's all about speaking. That's priority. I just
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:40.700]   need to have these lessons and get over my lack of confidence in using the little language
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:46.900]   that I have. But with time, when I have the basic ability to communicate, then I find
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.580]   some of the more traditional learning resources are great. I will go through a language learning
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.980]   course book and do its exercises. I don't recommend that to people at the beginning,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.540]   but in the later intermediate stages, that's when you need to start polishing up your skills.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.820]   That's when it becomes a little bit more important in this triage system. You no longer have
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.620]   gunshot wounds, so maybe the runny nose of getting the genders right in the language
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.220]   is a little bit more important now because you've solved all the other big problems.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:23.380]   I start to focus on grammar. I will study grammar. I'm not a fan of grammar in the beginning
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:28.060]   stages. I think it is one of the worst uses of your time to be studying grammar when you've
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:32.460]   just started to learn the language. But at the intermediate stage, that's when it is
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.140]   actually a bigger priority because that is literally your biggest problem. You're already
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:42.380]   communicating in the language, but your grammar is lacking, so that's what you try to fix.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:47.620]   It's a very dynamic approach that you see what is my biggest problem right now and you
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:53.780]   try to solve that problem progressively with time. For people just starting off, your biggest
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.180]   problem is you can't say anything in the language and you don't know what they're saying back
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:04.860]   to you, so this is more a case of just pushing through the practice stage of giving yourself
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.140]   face time with a human being in whatever way that may be.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:15.720]   For languages that don't use the kind of Latin alphabet, how important is reading and writing?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:20.980]   Reading and writing is something I also tend to put later in the intermediate, regardless.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:26.140]   Even for Latin based languages like Spanish or French, I wouldn't pick up a book and try
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.940]   to read it until I'm at the intermediate stages because it's just too much work with Spanish.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.580]   When I first started, one of my failed experiments was I picked up El Senor de los Anillos, Lord
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.660]   of the Rings, and I thought if I read this, I'll be fluent by the end of it. It took me
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:48.340]   weeks to get to page two because I was literally looking up every single word. That was really
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.300]   not a good use of my time, whereas when I've reached the intermediate stage, then it becomes
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:59.260]   more manageable. Then I'm only looking up every 15th or 30th word. I can actually read
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:05.340]   significantly more and it becomes more pleasurable. Personally, I leave reading till later. I
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.940]   wouldn't necessarily say this is something I would prescribe to everybody because I've
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:15.700]   interviewed a lot of other language learners, a lot of episodes on my podcast where I talk
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:20.100]   to very interesting people. I can think of a bunch of them. There's Steve Kaufman, who
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:26.580]   runs the website LingQ. There's Professor Krashen, who's very famous for talking about
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.820]   comprehensible input, which is philosophy in language learning, where you try to get
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:36.620]   exposure to something that is within your language level, and that leans a lot more
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.740]   towards reading and people would actually read from the beginning. That may work more
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.260]   appropriately for a lot of people, but what I've found is it tends to work a little bit
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:53.260]   more for maybe either older generations or people who are really not as passionate to
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.700]   speak the language, and that's fine. They have a lot of goals in the language, but walking
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:02.220]   up to people and using it with them ultimately is maybe not their biggest priority. In my
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.100]   case, I'm a traveler. Speaking the language is by far the biggest priority. I need to
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:13.380]   make friends. I need to interact with people in complicated situations. Once I've done
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.540]   that, then I come back to reading and writing, regardless of whatever script it uses.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.720]   In terms of how they're different, I don't really change how I learn a language when
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.940]   it's European versus when it's an Asian language. Maybe with something like Chinese as a character-based
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:36.300]   writing system, in that case, I would absolutely learn all my vocabulary through pinyin, which
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:42.140]   is the romanized version of Chinese characters. People say Chinese is one of the hardest languages
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.660]   in the world. Actually, Mandarin is not that hard. Grammatically, it's very straightforward,
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:54.600]   and the way the words are formed is very logical. I really don't think Mandarin is that bad
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:00.800]   of a language, but of course, Chinese characters are a huge barrier that you have to work through.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.600]   I just decide, let's take this in two stages, like a native Chinese person would have done.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.560]   Chinese children learn how to speak first, and then they learn how to read and write.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.440]   That's what I was going to do. I learned how to speak Mandarin, and I would remember my
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.840]   vocabulary through pinyin, which is using our letters from the Latin alphabet to remember
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:27.200]   how to say the words. Then with time, I added Chinese characters so I could begin to read
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.800]   when that was in my triage system of a bigger priority.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.380]   For a language like Korean that I'm currently doing, its writing system is very logical.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.040]   You can learn it in a weekend if you put some intensive time into it. It's very straightforward.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:47.480]   A lot of languages that have a phonetic system, like Cyrillic for Russian, or Arabic, or Greek,
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.780]   or in the case I'm doing now, Korean, you can still incorporate learning the writing
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.040]   system because that's going to help you a lot with vocabulary. You really want to be
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.680]   learning your vocabulary through its writing system when it's phonetic.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.000]   People get intimidated. When I saw Korean before learning it, I was like, "Wow, all
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.440]   these circles and lines. This must take years to master." It is so easy. I cannot overstate
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.040]   how easy the Korean writing system is to pick up. It's extremely logical, and it's something
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.640]   I did in a weekend. You would be surprised for a lot of languages. It looks intimidating
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.900]   because all these squiggles and lines you've never seen before, but it's like anything.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.480]   You put a little bit of time in, and it becomes manageable.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.720]   Are there some languages that do skew on the harder or easier side to learn?
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.280]   I definitely have talked about this quite a lot. There's a podcast I've done with Paul
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.320]   Jorgensen, and he's a big YouTuber, millions of subscribers from the Lang Focus. In that,
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.560]   we talked about how to make difficult languages easy. People can find that in my podcast.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.040]   Very fascinating when you dive into that one particular topic. But what I say in general
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.440]   whenever I'm thinking about this is, I like to get people in a different mindset. I'll
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:09.760]   give you an example. When I was in Spain learning Spanish, I met a Spaniard who was learning
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:15.000]   both Japanese and French. I said to him, "Obviously, French is going to be a lot easier for you,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.280]   isn't it? Because it's in the same language family." He said, "Absolutely not. Japanese
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.800]   is so much easier." I didn't get it. I was like, "How? It's so different." He said, "Because
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.480]   I'm forced to learn French in school, whereas I really want to go to Japan. I like anime.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.640]   I think Japanese girls are cute. I've always dreamed of living in the country."
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:40.200]   That completely transformed his experience and it made Japanese easier. When people come
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.960]   from this more academic way of looking at a language, they think, "How am I going to
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.560]   decide which language is harder? Well, I'm going to put one language on one side, another
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.760]   language on another side, and compare them side by side. If I see more common words between
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.680]   English and French, that makes it easier. If I see complicated grammar, like Japanese
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.740]   having a different word order in the sentence, that makes it hard."
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:11.640]   That for me is such an inhuman way of deciding which languages are harder and easy. It is
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.800]   easy to scale it. You can say, "Regardless of the person, this language is harder than
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.860]   that." But realistically, each person has their own situation when it comes to learning
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.000]   a language. They have their own passions, their own motivations.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.520]   When I think of all the languages I've learned, compare my experiences, I would say something
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:39.240]   like Chinese was actually easier for me than Spanish. People always think, "That doesn't
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.600]   make any sense because Spanish is much closer to English," and all these other reasons.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:49.080]   But ultimately, I had a bad language learning approach with Spanish for a long time. It
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.840]   took me a very long time to get to fluency with Spanish, to even get to a conversational
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:59.080]   level. I kept kicking myself. I kept telling myself, "Your Spanish is miserable. People
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:04.040]   are laughing at you. Who would want to speak Spanish with you?" All of these reasons are
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.840]   why it took me so long to learn Spanish.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.720]   Whereas with Mandarin, at that stage, I had a good language learning approach, a good
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:18.800]   attitude. I embraced making mistakes. After three months, I reached a pretty good conversational
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.280]   stage. People can see YouTube videos of me where I'm interviewing people in Mandarin
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.120]   three months after I've started to learn the language. I could not do that with Spanish.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.680]   This does not mean I'm going to say universally, "Therefore, Mandarin is easier than Spanish."
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.600]   Obviously not. It is the context. I was a more confident person. I didn't have great
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:46.160]   motivation at the start. I didn't really know why did I want to learn Spanish. I was putting
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.880]   the effort in a very inconsistent way.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.600]   Whereas with Mandarin, I knew I want to travel China. I want to take a train 2,000 kilometers
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:51:00.120]   deep into the country. I want to make a video of me getting a kung fu lesson in a village
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:06.240]   with a kung fu master. All these dreams that I managed to make come true, I had these in
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:12.400]   mind and that made Mandarin easier. When I talk to people and I see they've decided they
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:18.320]   want to learn a particular language and it has real, genuine significance in their life,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.040]   like their family background is there, or they have a love interest in the country they
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.840]   want to move in with, or whatever it may be, that is their passion and that is going to
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:33.880]   make that language significantly more approachable because they have huge motivation to learn
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   it.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:40.440]   Whether languages are easier or harder is insignificant because they aren't going to
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:47.080]   be easier if you don't care about them. Whatever language is the most important in your life,
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:51.880]   that is the easiest language because that's the one you're going to be able to get momentum
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   to learn.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.160]   I love that. I know a lot of the podcasts we talk about travel. I know a lot of our
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.360]   listeners love to travel. One of the times people are often most excited to learn a language
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.260]   is that maybe they planned a trip or they have this, like you said, in China, a vision
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:09.240]   for a trip they want to take. Not everyone who is planning a trip to a foreign country
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:16.640]   necessarily feels like they need to become fluent. Is there a stop along the way where
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:22.200]   you can have enough skills in a language to have a different experience traveling and
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:27.960]   unlock really interesting things that you can get to a lot quicker? Any advice for someone
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   in that situation?
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:34.160]   Well, when it comes to language levels, there is a lot of specificity with this. This is
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.800]   something I take into account with my targets. I always work off the European Common Framework,
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:45.320]   which has a very specific way of categorizing language levels. It splits it into A, B, and
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:52.440]   C, and within each one, it further subsplits it into one and two. A is beginner, B is intermediate,
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:59.280]   C is advanced, one is lower, two is upper. A2 means you're an advanced beginner, and
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:05.400]   C1 means you're a lower level mastery speaker of the language. This scale of six different
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:12.560]   levels is where I pin everything. For me, fluency begins at the B2 level. This is upper
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.880]   intermediate. What that means is you can talk about most things you would talk about in
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:24.040]   casual social situations, but because you're not at the C levels, you don't have a mastery
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.440]   level. In my case, I studied engineering. The languages I have a C level at, I could
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.520]   work as an engineer in those languages, and I could have a philosophical conversation
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:37.560]   with you about very deep subjects, but for the most part, most conversations I'm going
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.720]   to have are at the high level B2 social conversations. That's what I'm aiming for, and it's important
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:50.080]   on this scale to remove perfectionism, because even the C2 is still not perfect. It means
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.680]   that you can work functionally through the language the same way you would in your mother
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:01.760]   tongue. Now, on this same scale, I think at the A2 level, upper beginner, this is where
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:09.400]   you can function very confidently as an independent tourist in the language. You can ask for directions,
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.080]   you can get the gist of their reply, you can deal with problems like you have an injury
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:19.100]   and you can get yourself to the hospital. All of these very basic functional things
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:24.720]   you can do with confidence, even though you can't necessarily have full-on conversations.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.320]   I think that is fine for somebody who's going to the country briefly, and this is something
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:34.500]   you can genuinely get to in a lot shorter of a time than people realise. The very steep
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.920]   curve at the beginning, you can make a lot of progress very quickly. What tends to happen
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:45.460]   is we reach the intermediate plateau. This is where things start to get really rough,
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:50.600]   where you're putting as much effort in, but you get stuck at the middle level. This will
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:55.960]   happen to everybody, and that's okay as long as you can push through to very beginning
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:01.320]   stages. That B1, I feel, is something that is definitely achievable in a matter of a
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.200]   certain amount of months for people. Regardless of your background, if you're able to put
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:11.080]   the time in, a B1 level means you can have a lot of conversations with people, as long
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:17.320]   as they're a little patient with you. It does not count as fluency, but it counts as conversational.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:22.880]   For me, this is where I love to be in my travels because I can start to make friends in the
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.800]   language. I can really hang out with people. If you're single, you can go on dates with
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.240]   people. You can do a lot with that B1 level. This, for me, is a minimum to feel like I'm
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:40.400]   truly experiencing the culture in a direct way. Anything less than that is more a case
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.680]   of how confident a tourist you are going to be, which in itself can be a wonderful thing.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.840]   You can have a lot of great experiences, but ultimately you are going to be doing most
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:55.180]   of your things in English if you're only at an A2 level. It depends on your style of travel.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:00.560]   My style of travel, obviously, is I avoid English. I want to make only local friends,
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:06.480]   so I have to get at least a B1 level. That's where, when you said at the beginning, Benny
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:13.360]   speaks 12 languages, number 12 comes from B1 and up. I personally only say I speak a
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:19.800]   language if I can have conversations in the language, not if I would function as a tourist.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:25.560]   I actually have another dozen languages that I could function as a tourist quite confidently,
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.120]   but the thing is, that's not as impressive as it sounds because you can do that a lot
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.840]   quicker than people realize. You can be a very confident tourist. You can have a bunch
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:38.400]   of phrases ready to go in a very short time span, especially if you're having consistent
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.960]   conversations ahead of time. I did, for a while, travel to the country and think I'm
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.980]   going to get off the plane and immediately start speaking the language or start learning
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.480]   the language. That was an interesting period in my life, but nowadays I try to learn the
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.800]   language ahead of time. I don't leave it for when I'm in the country, especially for people
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:03.120]   who can only travel to a country for a very limited amount of time. I don't want to be
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.760]   in language learning mode if I'm only going to be in a country for a month or two. I want
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.200]   to really get to know the place. I do my work ahead of time and then I can explore and make
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.760]   friends once I get to the country.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.980]   You said people can learn it way faster than they'd imagine. Could you put any kind of
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.060]   rough window on that? If someone's got a trip planned to Japan in a month, do you think
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:27.140]   they could pick up enough to get to the, not the B level, but in that A level, be able
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:31.140]   to have a conversation and ask some directions and have a few more local experiences?
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:36.860]   You do that in a weekend. People don't realize how quickly you could learn phrases. I think
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:42.380]   a lot of us just lack the confidence and we can't picture a universe where we walk up
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:48.100]   to somebody and ask for directions when we've never spoken a language before. We imagine
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:53.780]   this is only something geniuses do. I really want people to lower the bar on what they
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:59.940]   think counts as speaking a language as a tourist, because it's really not that impressive.
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:05.880]   You're learning a very finite number of sentences you can rattle off. You do not need to know
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:10.060]   the intricacies of the language. Whenever I'm starting off and I want to be a tourist
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:15.300]   in a language, I'll sing myself the phrase I want to learn. I'll sing that to myself
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.660]   a few times and that helps me remember it. I'll do that in 10 minutes. I'll learn how
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:25.420]   to say where is the library and I'll look it up online. I'll try to say it and that's
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:31.460]   it. It's really not that impressive. If you're going to Japan in a month, you can learn 20
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:36.260]   phrases this weekend. Instead, decide I'm going to take this month. I'm going to try
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:42.420]   and be able to maybe understand their replies to me. I'm going to try and push myself up
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:49.740]   to see if I can get to that A2 level and maybe be a little bit more confident to expand on
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:55.380]   my sentences, have a little bit of maneuverability where I'm not just rattling off memorized
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.380]   phrases. I can replace a word or two here or there. You could do that in a month, but
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.580]   if you're going to Japan, you're really passionate about it, maybe you should decide this next
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:09.700]   month I'm going to make those sacrifices and I'm really going to try and make Japanese
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:15.380]   my priority so that when I'm in Japan, I'm communicating a lot more than I would otherwise.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.420]   But it sounds like to be able to ask questions and get a response, not necessarily be fluent
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:25.540]   at all a month, if you can really put in the time, is not an unreasonable goal.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:30.380]   Absolutely. What I understand this tourist level of the language, then the A levels,
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.420]   this way more accessible than people imagine it to be. Once you've done it a couple of
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:39.220]   times, you realize you're just learning a few phrases and just trying to commit them
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.060]   to memory and then rattling them off and maybe learning a couple of the words that could
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:49.260]   come up in the replies. It's not that complex. The B levels do require a certain intimate
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:54.820]   understanding of how the language is truly piecing together its replies and having a
[00:59:54.820 --> 01:00:00.300]   broader vocabulary so you can expand on things. But the early levels, you could do that a
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:05.860]   lot easier than you imagine. Love it. Any final kind of tips or hacks when it comes
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.980]   to language learning? I know you've written so many language hacks books that people should
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.340]   put in their arsenal as they're going through this process.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:18.420]   I've mentioned my biggest hack, but in general, my philosophy is I would really encourage
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:24.480]   people to make as many mistakes as possible. When I'm really getting into learning a language
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.520]   and doing it intensively, my goal is today I'm going to make 200 mistakes or more. That's
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.220]   my goal. And that gets you completely away from this academic mindset where every mistake
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:42.020]   brings you closer to a fail. Every mistake is you communicating more, suck a little less
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.020]   every day. That's my biggest takeaway other than speak from day one. I would encourage
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:54.860]   people to make mistakes, embrace your inner Spanish Tarzan or whatever you imagine this
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:01:00.620]   caveman functionality of the language. Try to just use that and that's how you move forward.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.980]   That's how you push through those A levels to eventually then be communicating in the
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:11.260]   language. Embrace being a beginner. It's fine. I've had such wonderful experiences in many
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.900]   of my languages, even in those beginner A levels, I've had interactions that I remember
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.900]   for the rest of my life. That's great. You don't have to only be fluent in the language
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:27.820]   to have rich experiences in it. Once you are okay with being a beginner, it becomes a lot
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:32.340]   easier to have fun with it, to make progress, and then to go beyond that.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.900]   I love it. Two things. One, I can imagine that people listening, we've talked multiple
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:41.460]   times about all these languages you've picked up and I'm sure there's people just curious.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.300]   Would you mind sharing the languages you've hit that B and above level just so people
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.860]   can suffice their curiosity?
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:53.700]   Most of the romance languages I would have B2 and above. So genuine fluency, C in a lot
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:02:01.140]   of them. This would be Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and I have probably a B1 in Catalan
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:08.380]   as well. I have German, also a high level and probably a B1 again in Dutch. American
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:13.820]   sign language. That would be another B1. So most of my C levels are the romance languages.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:19.340]   I also have Mandarin. I did reach a B1 level of that. So I think I'd need probably a couple
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:24.500]   of weeks to get back to the B1 level before I return to the likes of China. Currently
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:29.420]   learning Korean. And I'd say by the time this goes live, I'd say pretty confident that it's
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:35.340]   a B1 too. And then I've dabbled in a bunch of others that I would not put on that scale,
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.620]   but that's it in a nutshell. Oh yeah, Irish and Esperanto. Sorry, I forget sometimes when
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.500]   I'm listening to these languages. Yeah, go ahead.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.560]   Great. Last thing. I know you've traveled quite a bit. Is there a place that someone
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.480]   looking for some travel inspiration can take from you? Maybe a favorite city or country
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.740]   or town that isn't the obvious place that's on everyone's list that you want to share
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.860]   and maybe why it's special?
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.460]   In a lot of countries, I'm a big fan of the second city. So rather than the capital city,
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.880]   I think the second city as a general rule, it's going to be more affordable. You're going
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:13.700]   to have less foreigners, so more of a chance to meet local people who maybe aren't overwhelmed
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.940]   with how many foreigners there are. Right now in Korea, I'm talking to you from Busan,
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:23.220]   which is the second city. And I can list a lot of advantages over going to Seoul because
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:28.580]   of how more of an authentic experience I'm having, but still having the comforts of being
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580]   in a city.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.020]   Obviously you're going to be even more authentic if you go to a village somewhere, but the
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:39.660]   city life I happen to enjoy the second city in a lot of countries. I'm a huge fan of basing
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.820]   myself there for a certain period of time to get to know the culture in a different
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.940]   way. And generally I tend to be one of the few foreigners who is in that city to be able
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.100]   to have a bit more of an authentic experience.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.980]   I love that. Just a general rule of thumb is second city. Great. If you have any final
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:01.780]   parting wisdom for anyone, please share it. Otherwise, let people know where they can
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.660]   find everything you're working on.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:09.620]   Yeah. So since you're in podcast mode right now, if you do a search for language hacking,
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:14.100]   that's my podcast. I've interviewed a lot of very interesting people with the full scale
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.060]   of people who are just starting out and having their initial success, the people who are
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:23.460]   professional linguists in the field and have been doing this for decades. I run my own
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:29.520]   coaching program where I help people to learn a language in three months to get to a conversational
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.100]   stage. People will find that on my website.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:38.700]   Of course, I'm on all the social medias. I actually, as part of my way to practice languages,
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:44.300]   I make a new social media account in each of the languages, even threads that as we're
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.940]   recording this now, it's only existed for a week. I have 14 threads accounts just so
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:56.380]   I can follow in my target languages. I have 14 Tik Tok accounts, 14 Instagram accounts.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:01.780]   And I use all of these to maybe post vertical videos to practice the language and of course,
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:07.660]   follow people. And my main one is Irish polyglot on most of the channels. People can find me
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.980]   there and get some more inspiration.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.980]   That just made me think of one last thing before we go. Is that a tactic, maybe following
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:18.020]   accounts in other countries on social media, it never occurred to me as a potential way
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.820]   to practice or learn a language.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:24.180]   A tactic that's a bit broader than that is think, what do you tend to do with your time
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.060]   and how can you do that in your target language? If you're the kind of person who winds your
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:33.460]   day down with Netflix, maybe create a new sub account. You know, you can have multiple
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:38.620]   sub accounts on the same main login and make that just your target language. You're only
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:43.660]   watching stuff in the language and the algorithm will recommend that to you. I personally happen
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.540]   to watch a lot of Tik Tok videos. That's how I wind down as I swipe up, watch Tik Tok rather
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.220]   than do that in English, which is not really that good of a use of my time.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:58.780]   I created new accounts and I trained the algorithm to only show me content in those languages.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.420]   I only followed people who made content in those languages. When I switched to it, I'm
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:08.540]   in that language mode, I'm using my computer. So I made sure that I could switch the language
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.700]   on my computer on my phone. I very quickly changed the interface on my phone. It's more
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.540]   of a broader thing of thinking, how are you living your life? What are the things you're
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:22.000]   doing and can you change any of those things to be in your target language?
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.020]   You like playing video games? Change the language that they're giving you the orders to shoot
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:33.500]   that guy to be in your target language. There's a lot of ways you can have this sense of virtual
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:38.820]   immersion without even having to leave your home country, that you can exist in the language.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:45.460]   You like working out? I work out these days to Korean workout music. That's the same kind
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:50.380]   of bump, thump, thump music, but they're singing in Korean. Everything you do, try to do it
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.140]   in your target language. In my case, I use social media a lot, so I may as well use social
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.480]   media in my target language.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.140]   I love that tip. This has been fantastic. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm excited
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.060]   to pick up a new language.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:07.420]   Thank you, everybody. I hope to hear from all of you and best of luck on all of your
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.780]   own language journeys.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.440]   Thank you so much for joining this week. I hope this episode has inspired you to either
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.260]   pick up a language that you haven't spoken in a while, maybe even try to learn a new
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:23.060]   one. I know for me, I'm already thinking about how to improve my French. If you have questions,
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.000]   thoughts, or feedback on this episode, or anything at all really, podcast@allthehacks.com
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.140]   is where you can reach me. Thank you so much for listening this week. See you next week.
