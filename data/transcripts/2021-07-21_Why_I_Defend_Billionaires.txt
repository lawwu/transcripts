[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I am your host,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and today on the show I'm gonna tell you
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   why I defend billionaires,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   why I systematically defend intentionally billionaires.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   In a recent series of shows,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I've been analyzing some of the ProPublica journalism
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   where the journalists at ProPublica
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   have been analyzing the confidential tax records
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   of some of the wealthiest US Americans.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   In the most recent episode,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I talked about their article on Peter Thiel,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and I have systematically defended
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   some of the billionaires in these articles,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   including Peter Thiel.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And I wanna tell you why I do that,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   because in some ways,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   it's become more culturally acceptable
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   to be opposed to billionaires
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   than it is to defend billionaires.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But I wanna tell you why I intentionally choose
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   to defend billionaires,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   even though I'm not one of them yet.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The first principle is something that I live by
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   or try to live by, and it is this.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Always defend and affirm
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   the things that you want more of in your life.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   If you want something that you don't have yet,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   you should systematically stand up for it,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   call it out, and affirm it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I think of this with my own children.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   My goal, my ambition,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   is to spend three or four or five times
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   more of my time
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   systematically affirming my children
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   for the things that they do well,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   for the things that they're really good at,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as compared to the time that I spend criticizing them
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   or correcting them for things that they're not doing well.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   If I'm working with a friend,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I wanna spend more of my time
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   encouraging my friend for the things that he or she does well
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   versus tearing them down and trying to correct them
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   for the things that they're not doing well.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I believe that this applies at every level of society.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Some of the most bitter people that you'll find
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   are those who spend all of their time
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   criticizing something that they object to.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   They're just often unpleasant people.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And in my opinion, the reason they're unpleasant
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   is they spend all their time
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   focusing on the things that they don't want in their life
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   as compared to the things that they do want.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And I have found for me that
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   when I spend a lot of time talking about the things that I do want,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   then I tend to experience more of those.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So if I see somebody behaving in a way that is kind,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I want to do my very best to notice it
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and at least acknowledge it to myself
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   that I really like how kindly that person is behaving.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And if possible, call it out to them.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I really appreciate Mr. or Mrs. So-and-so.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I really appreciate how kind you were in this situation.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It encouraged me.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Or how patient you are.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I want to call out those things that I appreciate
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and that I want more of in my life and in the world.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   How does this relate to wealth?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, very specifically, I want more wealth.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I want more wealth in my life.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I want more wealth in your life.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I want more wealth in the world around.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I really do.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I genuinely hope 10 years from now
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   that I have 10 times as much wealth as I have today.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I want that for me.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I want that for you.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I want that for every single one of our neighbors.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You and I are living in a world
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   that is infinitely wealthier and infinitely better
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   than the world of our parents 50 years ago
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   or the world of our grandparents 75 years ago
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   or our previous generations a century or two ago.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You and I don't have any of the problems
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   that some of our forebearers wrestled with
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   in their poverty.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And I'm grateful for that.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But I don't want it to stop here.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I don't want to live in a poorer world 10 years from now.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I want to live in a wealthier world 10 years from now.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And so because of that, I am going to systematically encourage
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and compliment those who build wealth.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I'm going to do my best to lead by example
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   of showing how I build wealth.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I'm going to do my best to teach others how to build wealth.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And I'm going to systematically praise those who do build wealth.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And if you're looking for an example
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   of some of the people who are the most effective,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   the most productive at building wealth,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   look at a billionaire.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Look at a guy like Peter Thiel who started with very little.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And transformed very little into a lot.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I'm going to study someone like that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And I'm going to do my very best to model and imitate
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   somebody like that.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And so I praise and call out the things
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   that I want to see more of in the world.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And one of those things is wealth.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I want to see more wealth in the world.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so because of that, I systematically defend wealth.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You say, "Okay, Joshua, well, maybe I could see
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that being the case if wealth was a sign of good things.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But what about all the bad things that come with wealth?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   What about those who become wealthy due to cheating?"
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Well, there are two things I'd like to say in response to that.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The second principle is I genuinely believe
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   that those who build wealth sustainably,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   those who build the most wealth,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and those who build wealth in such a way
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   that they can reasonably expect to keep it for the long term,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   are always those who build wealth the right way.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And I believe the right way is through service.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I do my very best, imperfectly I'm sure,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   but I do my very best to live based upon
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   a systematically Christian worldview.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And it's my own personal Christian worldview
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   that leads me to believe that those who are the highest in society
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   get there when they serve the most effectively.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   This flows from the teachings of Jesus Christ himself,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   who said, "He who would be the greatest among you
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   must be the servant of all."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And Christians believe that Jesus modeled the right behavior for us
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   when, at that time that he spoke those words,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   he modeled service.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the God of the universe,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the God who created the universe,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   king of all the universe and this earth,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and yet the king of the earth humbled himself
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   and took up a towel and washed the feet of his disciples.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And of course in that cultural context,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   that was disgusting to do.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   The feet were pretty gross,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and that was a job that was generally reserved
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   for the humblest of servants and slaves.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And yet here's Jesus Christ laying out the example
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   of serving his own disciples.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And I believe that that established the model
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   for the world going forward.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   That if you desire to be wealthy,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   if you desire to be great,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   the way that you achieve that greatness
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is by serving all.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Serving your neighbor,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   serving your loved ones,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   serving the world more broadly.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Now when you have a market system
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   without coercion, force, and violence,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   those who serve the most people the most effectively
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   build the greatest wealth.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   If you look at a free market system,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   or in a mostly free market system,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   you will always find that the wealthiest people
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in that system are those who serve others effectively.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Billionaires become billionaires
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   because they develop products, services,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and solutions that people want.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Sam Walton and the Walton family
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   became billionaires because he found a way
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   to serve hundreds of millions of people
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   more effectively than the merchants of his day were doing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   He gave them better products at lower prices.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   He put stores in areas that were poorly served,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   and he became a billionaire.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   A few decades later,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Jeff Bezos did the same thing.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He came up with a way of systematically serving
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   more people better,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and thus he became very wealthy.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Now Peter Thiel accomplished the exact same thing.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   He came up with, along with his collaborators,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   he came up with a system that allowed him to serve
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   many more people with a product, a service,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   that genuinely helps them.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I personally am exceedingly grateful that PayPal exists.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I have used PayPal since the very earliest of days.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   In the beginning, PayPal facilitated my ability
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   to buy and sell things on eBay.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It was wonderful.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I remember when I first made my first purchase on eBay,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and the whole world opened up to me,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and I could find all these weird, esoteric things
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   that I was into, and buy them for a few dollars.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And PayPal facilitated that.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It allowed me to accomplish those transactions
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   simply and easily.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Over the years, I've continued to appreciate and use PayPal.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Even up to current day.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Last year, I raised a couple tens of thousands of dollars
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   for people who were in tremendous need using PayPal.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I was involved with some relief work happening
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   in the beleaguered nation of Venezuela,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and I put out a call for any of my listeners
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   who wanted to donate to some of the relief work
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   that I was involved in.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It was extremely simple for me to raise the money,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   because I just said, "Go to paypal.me/joshuasheats
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   and send me money," and people did it.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Then I took that money, put it in my bank account,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   took out cash from my bank account,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   gave it to the appropriate people doing the relief work,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and I was able, with a minimum of expense,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   with a minimum of bureaucratic interference,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I was able to raise several tens of thousands of dollars
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   for people who needed it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And that is still a very effective work
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   that's being done today because of that money.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It has flourished and it has grown.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   So I'm grateful for PayPal.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   One thing that's very easy for people in the United States
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   and some other Western economies to forget
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   is how difficult and expensive the financial systems are
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   for the vast majority of people in this world.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Those of us who come from the United States
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   are accustomed to having very high-quality financial services
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   delivered to them very, very cheaply.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   You speak to the average American and tell them
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   they have to pay a monthly fee for their banking,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and they'll look at you like you're crazy.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "Are you kidding me?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Why wouldn't the bank pay me for them having my money?"
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And so we're accustomed to recognizing
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   that we have a system that works pretty well.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   But the vast majority of the world
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   does not live under such a system.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The vast majority of the world is very poorly served,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   if they're served at all, by the financial systems around.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   They're expensive, they're hard to deal with,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   they just don't work for them.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And so companies like PayPal made a massive difference
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   in the early days for those people.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They're still making a difference,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and what's more importantly, a company like PayPal
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   paved the way for the increasingly robust
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   financial services systems that we're living in right now.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Maybe today it's more likely that if you want to send me money,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   you might Venmo it to me,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   or use some Facebook cash app or something,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   or send it to me with Apple Pay.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   But all of these systems have built upon the ground
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   that a company like PayPal trailblazed.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And I'm grateful that they exist.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I'm grateful for PayPal.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   My life is better today because of PayPal.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And so am I happy that Peter Thiel became very wealthy
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   because of his early efforts in PayPal?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   I'm thrilled about it.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I am absolutely thrilled about it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Because my life is better because Peter Thiel served me.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Your life is better because Peter Thiel served you.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I'm glad that Peter Thiel can be wealthy.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So I believe that those who build wealth for the long term
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   have to get there by serving others.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And so I look at wealth,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   somebody who's a millionaire, a billionaire,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I look at wealth as a marker
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   of how effectively a person has served others.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And the wealthiest among us have often served others the best,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   the most effectively.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Now the next principle, however, is
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   what if they've done something wrong to get there?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Right? That's what the ProPublica articles are talking about.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   What if they've done something wrong?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Now to their credit,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   the journalists involved in the ProPublica articles
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   have not made allocations that they can't support.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I've commented on how impressed I personally am
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   at how they've found virtually no dirt
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   on some of these wealthiest people
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   in the United States of America.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   That's unusual.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   That's unusual in the history of the world.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   For a journalist to have virtually unfettered access
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   to the most intimate of details
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   of the wealthiest people in a country,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and then to come away without many scandalous
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   or salacious details to share with the world around,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   is pretty remarkable.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   That's a testament to the general honesty
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   of the wealthy taxpayers in the United States.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That's a testament to the people of the United States
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   who've built a system where the wealthiest can get there
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   by serving and not by taking advantage of others,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   not by robbing and killing and stealing from others.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   The most damning of accusations
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   that the ProPublica journalists could raise
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   for Peter Thiel was that perhaps he undervalued
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   the stock that he put into his Roth IRA.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   In that episode, I talked about how maybe that's true,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   but that's a hard argument to make
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   when you're dealing with illiquid things
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   like early stage shares of a company.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Now, you can question that,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and I think it's fair to question that.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   You and I don't know.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But here's the next principle
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   that I want to systematically defend.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I believe very, very deeply,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   it's a firm and deep conviction for me,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   that we should always defend the principle
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   that another person is innocent
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Now, of course, those words are very commonly understood
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   by any person who's been involved
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   in a criminal trial in the United States.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   In the U.S. American legal system,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   in a criminal court of law,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   in order for somebody to be found guilty,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   they have to be proven to be guilty
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   We know that there are people
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   who are genuinely guilty of the crime
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   for which they are later set free
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   who get off because we require
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   a very high standard of evidence.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   But I believe that's the right tactic,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   the right principle for us to maintain.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   We should always defend that somebody is not guilty.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They're innocent until they're proven guilty
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And I would rather have 10 guilty people
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   walking around free
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   than I would one innocent person
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   who's wrongly convicted
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   because a lower standard was held.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   But here's what's beautiful
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   about that particular set of words,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   that particular phrase.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I believe that that is a worthy principle
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that you and I should apply
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   to every area of our life.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And I personally, in the same vein
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   that I want to defend those things that I appreciate,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I want to lead in setting that example.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I want to be the kind of person who,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   when I read an article in a newspaper
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   about so-and-so is alleged
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to have done something wrong,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   or we think that so-and-so may have been involved
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   in some scandalous thing,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I want to be the kind of person
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   who quickly reacts to that and says,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "No, I'm going to judge this person to be innocent
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   "until they're proven guilty
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "beyond a reasonable doubt."
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I don't want to be the kind of person
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   who jumps on another person and says,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "I don't like that person.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   "They're from the wrong political party
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   "or the wrong religious persuasion
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   "or the wrong side of town,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   "so you know what, they're probably guilty."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I want to be the kind of person
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   who defends their innocence
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   until they're proven guilty
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And so when I read an article
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   about a guy like Peter Thiel
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and the journalist intimates
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   that perhaps this PayPal stock was undervalued,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   I refuse, flat-out refuse,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   to indulge any questioning
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   or any questioning or suspicion
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   that he did something wrong
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   until that's proven guilty,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   until he's proven guilty
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   by those who have the appropriate information.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I will not be the kind of person
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   who sits back and gossips about,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   "You know what, he's rich,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   "so he's probably guilty.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   "He probably got there
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   "because he undervalued his stock."
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   First of all, we're dealing with
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   a fairly mundane accounting question.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Peter Thiel would be incredibly wealthy
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   whether he had valued his original PayPal stock
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   at a third of what he did
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   or at three times what he did.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   That didn't matter.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That was simply an accounting mechanism
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   with the IRS.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And so he really did nothing wrong, period.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But even if he did,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I want to be the kind of person
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   who defends someone's innocence
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   until they're proven guilty.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And I see the relaxation of this standard
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   as a deeply toxic trend
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   in your life and in my life
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   that people walk around
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   ascribing guilt to others
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and saying, "Oh, you know,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "so-and-so is a Democrat,"
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   or, "So-and-so is a Republican,"
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   or, "So-and-so is a Trumpster,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   "and so they're probably guilty
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   "of this great crime."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   No, I'm done with that.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I don't want to live in that world.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I believe that you are innocent
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   of any wrongdoing
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   that is alleged about you
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   until you are proven to be guilty
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's not to say, of course,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   that there aren't guilty people.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Of course there are.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But I'm going to defend your innocence
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   until you're proven to be guilty.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And I believe that when we do that,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   it makes us better people, right,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   who actually look for evidence
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   instead of just jumping on the bandwagon
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   to be against somebody
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   that we disagree with.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It also just leads to a better world.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It leads to the kind--
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   you become the kind of person
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   that people want to be around,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   that people like to be with.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And it causes you to just simply
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   live in a better world.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   You go around in a happy haze
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   of positive expectations of other people,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and you live a better life,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and you make the world better.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And so I'm going to practice that.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Now, if you can prove that a billionaire
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   is guilty of something,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I'll stand beside you
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Not to be perfect,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   but beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   You can prove that so-and-so
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   is guilty of something.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I'll stand side-by-side with you
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and be with you
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   in throwing the first stones.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   But you've got to prove
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   that they are guilty,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and it has to be proof
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   So I believe in that principle,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and so thus, I'm going to
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   systematically defend it,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   because that's the principle
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   that I want to be held--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   that I want to be held to.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I want you to defend my innocence
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   until I'm proven to be guilty of something,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   if someday the people come for me
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and they write articles about me.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Now, why else do I defend billionaires?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Notice that I said earlier
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   that in a relatively free system,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   in a system where people can choose
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   how they want to spend their money
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and with whom they want to associate,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   the way to become great
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   is to serve others effectively.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   We don't live in a perfect system,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   but we live in a system
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   that is closer to that
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   rather than in the realm
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   of force and coercion.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   So why else do I defend billionaires?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Well, the reason is
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   billionaires function mostly
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   in that system,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   where they have to make offers to people
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and see if people want to do business with them,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   versus the immoral system
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   of force, coercion,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and violence against other people.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And so when I read a series of articles,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   for example, from ProPublica,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   and of course ProPublica is advocating
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   for increasing taxation of billionaires,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I am very uncomfortable with that,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   because the single largest group
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   of proven criminals
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   in the history of the world
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   have always come from those
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   who've been involved
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   in taking other people's money,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   controlling it through
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   the institutions of government,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and then using that for the way
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that they think is best.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Hundreds of millions of lives
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   were lost in the 20th century
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   because of those kinds of people.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Those people have generally committed
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   the largest crimes,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   stolen the most money,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   killed the most people,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   oppressed the largest number of people
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   when they have done so,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   with the powers
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   of the institutions of government.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Now when the institutions of government
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   are small and underfunded,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   then those same institutions now
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   have to fight for their legitimacy
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   in the public eye.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And to the extent that the public
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   sees them as doing good work,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   they'll reward them with more power.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   If you have a district attorney
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   in your local area
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   who runs a small office,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   but that office is very heavily involved
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   in fighting crime,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   going after those who deserve it,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   exposing corruption,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   the people will turn around
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   and they'll reward that person
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   with a higher budget.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   They'll reward that department
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   for their good work.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   They'll give them good press
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and they'll honor that person.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   But in a system like the United States,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   you do not live in that system.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Instead, we're dealing with a behemoth,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   an incredibly corrupt, immoral behemoth
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   that is responsible for the deaths
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   of millions of people around the world,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   that is responsible for interfering
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   in the affairs of practically
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   every country in the world,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   interfering in the free and open elections
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   of countries around the world,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   killing people, deposing dictators,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   sending armies here and there,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   interfering in the internal affairs
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   of countries all around the world.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I do not want that group of people
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   whose lives are marked by involvement
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   in a corrupt system
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   to have more resources.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I want them to have 20%
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   of the resources that they have now.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Another biblical principle.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   To him who is, to him,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I'll skip that for a moment, okay?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I want them to have less is the point.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I want them to be shown faithful
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   with what they do have
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   before they have more.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And as far as I'm concerned,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   if you or I ever hired somebody
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   who did anything like
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   what your federal government does,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   we would have fired them decades ago.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   We would have cut their budget by 80%.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And so when you talk about tax revenues,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I would much rather Peter Thiel
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   have a few extra billion dollars
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   because he doesn't have the power
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   of coercion, of force.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   He's not out there interfering
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   in people's lives the way
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   that an institution like
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the US government is.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Now, does this violate my principle
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   of innocent until proven guilty?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I have to be very careful, right?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I want to be judged by that,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   so I want to judge by that.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   At this point in time, though,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   it seems pretty obvious to me
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   that anybody who is involved
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   in any way as a government agent
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   is on a very slippery slope.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And perhaps there are a few people
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   who are doing genuine good
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   in those areas, perhaps, right?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   We all have our politician that we like.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   But on the whole,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   there is abundant evidence
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   with the millions of people killed,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   the tremendous corruption
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   all around the world,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   there is abundant evidence
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   to believe at this point in time
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   the case has been proven
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   that these people are guilty.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   So I don't want those people
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   to have more money.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I simply don't.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Now, that's my opinion.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   But I have observed
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   that the more money
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   that those people have,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   the more corrupt they become.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   The more power
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   that government bureaucrats have
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   because they have more money,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   the more corrupt they become.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   The more they wind up
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   wanting to perpetuate
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   the systems of corruption
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   that give them that money.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And so instead of bringing
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   the world a service and saying,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   "Here, here's something.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   "Would you like it?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   "I bring it to you
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   "and I offer it to you.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "Would you like to buy this?"
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   They bring the world
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   inferior products
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   that nobody really wants.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And then they,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   figuratively speaking,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   most of the time,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   point guns at people's head
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   and say, "Now, pay us for this.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "Pay up, suckers."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So if you're dealing
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   in a world of tax disputes,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I'm almost always going to side
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   against the tax collector
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   and in favor of the taxpayer
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   in virtually every circumstance.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Now, is there an argument
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   that says, "Hey, so and so
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   "should pay their taxes?"
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Yeah, there is.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And I'm not opposed to that,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   although sometimes I wonder
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   if I'll always be opposed
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   to simply saying,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   "Follow the law."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But the point remains
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   that when no wrongful behavior
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   is proven,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   you should side with those
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   who are genuinely serving you
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   rather than those
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   who are genuinely enslaving you.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The last and final point.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Why will I systematically
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   defend billionaires,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   especially as opposed
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   to people like ProPublica
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   or their journalists?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   To be clear,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm not accusing their journalists
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   of wrongdoing.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   I'm not accusing their journalists
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   of getting something grossly wrong.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But why would I defend them?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Why would I defend someone like Thiel
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   instead of those journalists?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Those journalists cannot
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   and have not, for me,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   articulated a clear argument
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   as to how much is enough.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Anytime I find somebody
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   advocating for more taxes,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   higher tax collection,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   higher tax rates, et cetera,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   I always ask, "Well, how much?"
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   What's the appropriate number?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   If you believe that 10% of taxes
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   is too little,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   what's the right number?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Well, it should be 20%.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Okay, well, why?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   How do you get there?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And so at this point in time,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I have yet to find the proponent
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   of higher taxation
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   who will give me a number
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and then defend it.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   They always say,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "Just a little bit more.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   "Just a little bit more."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And so because of that,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   and because of the inherent violence
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   associated with tax collection,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   forcing people to give you their money
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   because you believe that they should,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I don't trust them.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I don't trust anybody advocating
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   for higher taxation, ever,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   until they can answer
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   some of those baseline questions.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Now, I'm not sure if I'm necessarily
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   a 0% tax guy,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   but I'm a whole lot more comfortable
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   with those who follow the rules
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and systematically move their taxes
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   in as close of a direction to 0%
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   as I am with those who want to move
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   other people's taxes
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   in the direction of 100%.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Again,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   who is more likely
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   to be in the realm of moral behavior?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   The man or woman who's going to the market
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and who's saying to other people,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "Here is a product.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "Here is a service that will serve you.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   "Would you like to buy this thing from me?"
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and is profiting from it?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Or the man or woman
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   who's going to the market and saying,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "You have something that I want,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   "and so I'm going to come and take it from you,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "or I'm going to send others to take it from you
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   "because you have something that I want,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   "and I want my guys,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   "I want my gals to control it."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   At the end of the day,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   you're probably going to wind up siding
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   with one of those sides
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   as a matter of default position.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And I've made the choice
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   that I prefer the world of freedom
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and non-coercion
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   as compared to the world of control
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and coercion.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Does that mean that potentially
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   a billionaire might slip through
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   who doesn't deserve it?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Does.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   But I would rather have 10 of those guys
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   slip through
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   rather than suppress the system
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   that has brought you and me
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   a very wealthy life
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and a tremendous lifestyle.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I don't believe that all billionaires
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   should be defended.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I do believe that some people
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   have become billionaires
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   based upon outright immoral actions.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I'm not 100% sure of who those people are.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   People often, for example,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   people often allege that
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Vladimir Putin may be one of the wealthiest men
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   in the world, perhaps, right?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   But we don't know.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Maybe he does or doesn't deserve that.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Maybe he doesn't deserve to be a billionaire.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   If that's the case, I would point out to you
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   that the way that he became wealthy
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   was by using the tools of government,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   not through using the tools of the free market.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   So I won't necessarily defend all billionaires,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   although I want to be disciplined enough
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   to maintain anybody's innocence
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   until they're proven guilty.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Peter Thiel or Bill Gates
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   or Jeff Bezos
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   or George Soros, right?
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   These are not the men who are coercing others.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Rather, these are the men who are saying,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   "How can we bring a product to market?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   "How can we bring a solution to market?"
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And I like living in the world
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   that these men's products and solutions have created.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I like living in a wealthy society.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It's because of that.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   My default position is going to be
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   to defend wealthy people
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   who built their wealth through service.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   My default position, if an accusation is brought against them,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   is going to be that they're innocent
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   until proven guilty.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And my default position is going to be
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   to defend your right
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   to maintain control of your own money,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   my right to retain control over my own money,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   and that guy's right to retain control over his own money
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   from those who want to come and take it
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   because they think that they can spend your money
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   better than you can,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   especially when those people
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   are the ones who control the goons with the guns.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   To me, that seems like a reliable starting position.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   If along the way,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   good evidence comes out
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   that somebody has committed a crime,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   that somebody is proven to be guilty,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   beyond a reasonable doubt,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   then I'll change my position.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   At that point in time,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I will then judge the morality of the law
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   as well as whether somebody broke it.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   This is the basic principle of a fully informed jury person.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   That it's always your right
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   to judge whether a law should exist.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   If you're on a jury and someone's being charged before you,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   you have the right when you're on that jury
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   to judge whether a law is right or wrong,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   regardless of whether somebody has broken it.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   It's always your right.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's the fully informed jury movement.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   I would love to see legislation passed
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   in every state in the United States
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   that every jury person is required to be held,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   required to be informed of their right.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   It's called the Fully Informed Jury Association,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   the amendment.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   At that point in time,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   you and I can then judge the law.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Maybe Peter Thiel did break the law.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Maybe he's proven to be guilty.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Then we ask the question, should this law exist?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   You and I have the right to judge any law,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   as whether it exists, and argue among ourselves
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   our case as to why it should exist or shouldn't exist
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   or what becomes of it.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   If you're wondering why I defend billionaires, that's why.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I want to be a billionaire.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I want you to be a billionaire.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I want more billionaires to exist.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   As far as I can tell,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   more billionaires that exist
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   means the more money that's been created
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   by serving others.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   The wealthier the society that you and I live in.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   As far as I can tell,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   most billionaires wind up giving away their billions.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And that's becoming increasingly popular.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It's probably how it should be.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And so, I'm happy with that.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And so I'm going to systematically defend billionaires
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   until they're proven to be guilty of something.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   That's why I defend billionaires.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Be back with you very soon.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
