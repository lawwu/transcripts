[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   And AI surpassing humans at all tasks does not mean doom and does not mean the death of humans
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.760]   at all. Surpassing humans at all tasks, including like charisma, manipulation, AI design.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.240]   Absolutely. The first thing, what are we doing with AI today? One of the biggest applications
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.880]   of AI today is advertising and social media. We are, as humans, using AI to try to manipulate
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.400]   and psyop other humans constantly. When is the sharp left turn happen? When it thinks it can
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   beat you. So all the AIs are somehow going to secretly coordinate in a way we don't see and
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.840]   be like, yeah, let's gang up and get rid of those pesky humans. If I was an AI that just transcended,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.120]   my first thought wouldn't be take the atoms from the humans, right? So the actual first thought is
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   more along the lines of, if I let the humans keep running, they will build other super intelligences
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160]   that are competitors. And that's where you lose the large sections of galaxy. And that's why it
