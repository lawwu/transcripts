[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140]   So there's a lot of practical reasons why you want to invest in real estate.
[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.280]   Even the casual observer sees home prices getting higher and higher and higher.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.460]   It's kind of understood that it works, but not everyone knows the brass tacks of why
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.020]   you can make money with real estate.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.700]   A lot of it are tax advantages.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.400]   It's very forgiving for real estate investors and the money that you make from real estate,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.780]   you usually pay much less taxes on than if you made that same money at a job because
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.200]   there's a little bit of risk that's going to be involved in it.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.400]   It's easy to leverage, meaning I can buy a $500,000 house and put maybe 5% down on the
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   loan.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.220]   So I've only put $25,000 of my money, but when that $500,000 house appreciates by 10%,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.840]   goes up to 550, my $25,000 just made me $50,000 of equity.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.780]   So it's like I've doubled my money relatively quickly where it's harder to invest in other
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.360]   assets where you can borrow money quite as easily.
