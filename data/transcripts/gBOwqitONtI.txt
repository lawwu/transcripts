[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   A sequence of return risk means that if you are a retiree
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320]   and you are taking money out of your portfolio,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.120]   you face some different challenges
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.520]   from say a buy and hold investor.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.680]   So imagine you're a buy and hold investor.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.840]   It doesn't really matter how the market performed
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.680]   along the way.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.240]   The only thing that matters is your average return
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.560]   over those 30 years.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.840]   So that determines uniquely what the final outcome would be.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.800]   Imagine you had something like a 10% average return
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.680]   between now and the end point.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.320]   And it doesn't matter if you had poor returns first
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.760]   and then very good returns later on or vice versa.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.480]   That's true for buy and hold investors,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.760]   but it's not so much true for people
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.360]   who are putting money into their portfolios.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720]   It's actually the flip side of this.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.400]   It turns out that for retirees,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.240]   it's not so much important what the average return is
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.480]   over your 30 year retirement horizon.
