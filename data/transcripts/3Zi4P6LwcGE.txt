[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   [Silence]
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   My name is Mark Zakevich. I'm one of the pastors at Grace Church and a seminary professor.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And so it's a delight to be here with you this morning, kicking us off with a little devotional.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   But before we do that, do you mind if I pray as we start our day?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And then we'll go into Acts chapter 17 for a few minutes.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Lord God, we thank you for another day.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And help us to remember that every single day is a blessing and a gift.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   And we are responsible to steward the hours that you give us every single day to the honor of your name,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   within the professions and the callings that you have given us.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   As we think about this day and this entire weekend, we do entrust it to you,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   asking that you would encourage every single person here to be faithful in the place that they find themselves in,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   both personally and professionally.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And as they look back on their lives, that they would confidently say,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   "It was lived to the honor of your name."
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And this morning, as we think about Paul in Athens,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Acts chapter 17, help us to be refreshed by the thought of your sovereignty.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   We pray this to the honor of your name. Amen.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Well, this is what I'd like to talk about this morning, as I said in my prayer.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Paul in the book of Acts, in Acts chapter 17.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And I'll have the passage on the screen for us, to kind of get us going devotionally,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   so you don't have to look at your Bibles, but you're welcome to, if that's your preference.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And as I begin, there is a man by the name of Samuel Rutherford,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think some of you may know and maybe even read some of his works,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   who's a very famous pastor in Scotland in the 1600s.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He was a pastor, but also a professor.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He wrote many letters, many sermons, many books, devotional and academic works.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   where he was asked to become a professor, but declined.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And then he was given a professorship offer at the University of Utrecht,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and even Holland, and also declined.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Ultimately, he became a pastor and a professor at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   then shortly after becoming director of that university.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He became one of the four commissioners sent to the Westminster Assembly from Scotland.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So now that gives us an understanding of who he was.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   A significant, influential, spiritual leader in Scotland in the 1600s.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And it was said of him, and I quote, "He was always praying, preaching, visiting the sick,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   catechizing, always writing, and always studying."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And he wrote letters to his congregants, encouraging them as they wrote,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   asking questions on how do you live the Christian life.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And this is what he wrote to a woman that was struggling in embracing God's providence in her life.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And this is what he wrote to her.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   "The great master gardener, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ in a wonderful providence,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   with his own hand planted me there, whereby his grace in this part of the vineyard I grow.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I dare not say, but Satan and the world," one of his pages whom he sends on his errands,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   "have said otherwise.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And here I will abide till the great master of the vineyard think fit to transplant me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But when he sees meat to loose me at the root, and to plant me where I may be more useful,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   both as to fruit and shadow, and when he who planted pulleth up that he may transplant,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   who dare put to their hand and hinder?"
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It's a wonderful reminder that where you find yourself in life is exactly where God wants you.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I have no idea what's happening in your life right now.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Maybe you're at the peak of your career, maybe you're just starting,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   or maybe you're going through the most difficult season of your career.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And that can apply to a personal life, or perhaps to your spiritual life.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But whatever's happening now, we're not faulting God for the problems in our lives,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   but we are trusting that God has us exactly where he wants us.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And if we trust that kind of a theology, then life becomes a bit more enjoyable,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and I think our stewardship becomes a bit more fruitful.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Because instead of pushing back and praying against God's providence, we embrace it.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I think that's Samuel Rutherford's intent in encouraging this woman
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   to embrace whatever God has given to her in this season of her life.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Now as we think about providence, our pastor, Pastor John, has defined worship as reflecting God's providence.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So I'm trying to make a link for us between worship and providence.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And if you read the book of the Psalms, you know that the Psalter frequently does that.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   His worship is in response to his reflections and meditation on the providence of God in his life or in the universe.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And so as he trusts God's sovereignty and embraces it, he responds in worship.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So as we look at Acts chapter 17, we know the story a little bit contextually.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   In chapter 16, Paul is chased out of Philippi.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Chapter 17 opens up with Paul being chased out of Thessalonica and Berea,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   and so he finally makes his way to Athens.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And as he lands in Athens, he ends up on what we call the Areopagus,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   a place where all the philosophers were theologizing about the different deities that they were worshiping in their pantheon.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And so Paul finds an altar to the unknown God.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   This is the actual altar to the unknown God, a picture from Rome, one of the museums in Rome.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And as he enters that arena, he is trying to find a way in, an on-ramp, into evangelism.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   How do we speak to these individuals about the unknown God?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And so this is what he does, and I'm going to read for us this passage beginning in verse 22 to kind of get our hearts set.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription to an unknown God.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   The God who made the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   doesn't dwell in temples made with hands, nor is he served by human hands as though he needed anything,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   since he himself gives life to all people and breath and all things.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And he made from one man every nation of mankind to inhabit all the face of the earth,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That they would see God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he's not far from each one of us.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   For in him will live and move and exist.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Even as some of your own poets have said, "For we are all also his offspring."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   an image formed by the craft and thought of man.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now commanding men that everyone everywhere should repent,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In righteousness through a man whom he had determined, having furnished proof to all by raising him from the dead.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So you can imagine Paul not attacking their religions, not criticizing, not mocking,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   but finding a connection by saying, "You're very religious."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Thereby understanding that God made every single person to be a worshiper.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Now they are worshiping the wrong things and we know that, but Paul's approach to evangelism is to say,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "I recognize that deep down you are a worshiper and I'm going to appeal to that desire, but I need to redirect it."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   As you find yourselves in your professional environments, I hope this gives us an example on how to evangelize.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Sometimes we are so aggressive in our love for Christ, so committed, that sometimes we come across as a little bit hostile.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Let's be honest about it, especially when we just get saved, right?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We're so zealous that everything is important all the time and we have to make sure that the person believes everything in the Bible immediately.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I've been there, trust me on that.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I remember for the first time believing in the sovereignty of God and I was going to take on the entire Russian Baptist Union,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   all the pastors who were Armenians.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I had my stack of sovereignty of God books and I was ready to battle anybody.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I was 18, I knew everything.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I remember that year.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I'm so glad nobody took me on.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But I think we sometimes evangelize that way and I have as well.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And then we look at Paul and Paul says, "Hey, there is something inherently embedded by God in each person to worship."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You just don't need to worship the right God.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Because our understanding of God will ultimately frame our entire life.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   It was Tozer who said, "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   For this reason, the gravest question before the church is always God himself.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And the most pretentious fact about any man is not what he at a given time may say or do,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   but what he in his deep heart conceives God to be like.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   We tend by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That is, we frame our lives and our thoughts to our understanding of God.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So since that is true, Paul says, "Let's begin with the sovereign God."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That's where it all starts.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And so as we think about the beginning of worship and the foundation of worship
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   being a grasp and an embracing of the sovereignty of God,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   we then understand it will frame our entire life.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And so Paul in Acts 17 does exactly that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   He said, "Let me introduce you to the sovereign God."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And God's sovereignty is manifest and really expressed in your life in three ways.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The first one is that Paul presents him as the author of your life.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Verse 24 said, "The God who made the world and all things in it,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   he's Lord of heaven and earth."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   In verse 26, he says, "He made from one man every nation of mankind
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   to inhabit all the face of the earth."
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And he doesn't need man to serve him because he gives life to all people, breath, and all things.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Paul says, "He is the Lord of heaven and earth."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Everything that's above you and everything that is below you.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And Paul uses the word cosmos.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Ultimately saying we're talking about the entire universe.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   We're not just talking about an aspect of creation.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The entire creation is in Paul's mind when he says that God is the author of life.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   In Psalm 50, this is what God says.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   In verse 10, "Every beast of the forest is mine.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   The cattle in a thousand hills.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I know every bird of the mountains.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Everything that moves in the field is mine.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   If I were hungry, I wouldn't tell you.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   For the world is mine and all it contains."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Can God be more dogmatic?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It's all mine.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And I don't need you to feed me.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   That's God's assessment of his sovereignty.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's all mine.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   So Paul says he doesn't need a temple to dwell in.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Because he isn't served by human hands.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Because, verse 25, he gives life and breath and all things to all people.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I think that's what we need to embrace and recognize.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   That our life, that's why I prayed at the beginning.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Thank you for this day.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   This passage has been in my mind so it's appropriate to reflect that way.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Thank you for allowing me to wake up today.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And whatever the day holds, thank you for at least letting me get out of bed.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And to move and to breathe.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And God gives life to all things.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And Paul says, in case you missed it, let me repeat it in verse 28.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   "For in him we live and we move and we exist."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Literally, we are.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   There's no we are apart from God's sovereign care of us.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   This is the first truth that Paul says, embrace the God who is sovereign because he's the author of your life.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   But secondly, because he is the architect of your life.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And that's the focus of verse 26.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   "He made from one man every nation of mankind to inhabit all the face of the earth."
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   "Having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And so what I think Paul is doing here, is he says, God determines your last name.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   He determines every nation of mankind.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The idea being, he places you in a specific nation.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   You were born where you were born because of God's design.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   In that specific nation and then you get granular in that specific family.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   God is the reason why you have the last name that you have.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I'm talking about before you get married.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But, God also does determine your last name in that case as well.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Because if you believe in providence, he also has a play, a role to play in that, doesn't he?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So, the first thing that we see of God as the architect of our life is that he determines our last name.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   But he also determines the length of our lives.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   That's why Paul says, he determined their appointed times.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Their appointed times when they live and how long they live.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Where they live and when and how long.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And third, he says in verse 26, the boundaries of their habitation.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   That's the location of your life.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So, now we begin to think about God moving people from place to place.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   From city to city, whether it's for school or for work or for ministry.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But God uses circumstances.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Sometimes it's dire circumstances.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Sometimes immigration that takes place is out of deep poverty.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Sometimes it's for a specific purpose.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Where you can be more useful because God is transplanting you from one continent to another.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   From one country to another in order to make you more fruitful.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   God is the architect of our lives.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Super intends all the details.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And I think here we find comfort.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Whatever is happening, it is God's perfect and just and loving plan for you right now.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Because he's behind the scenes setting it all up.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   If there's a medical issue in your life right now, God is bringing that into your life.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Ultimately to refine you, to conform you into the likeness of Christ.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But also to remind you that in him, you are.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   You exist because of his goodness.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Now you can interpret this as God is in control and I'm just a pawn in his hand.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Just a robotic entity.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Or you can think about it from the perspective of an architect.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Whenever an architect designs a house and he follows certain regulations.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And in LA is the worst because there are too many regulations.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If you've ever tried to remodel your house.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But generally speaking outside of Los Angeles, it has good intent.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   They're trying to be safe and to protect you from the roof from collapsing on you.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And so there is an element of safety and care and protection implied when the architect designs a specific building.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Much more so with God.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   God is a personal and loving God.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   He's not just trying to control as much as express his love for us.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And so God's care is demonstrated through him being the architect of our lives.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Meaning he's engaged in every detail.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Psalm 139 reminds us that God has protected us from the top, from the back, from the front.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And he's holding our hand as we move through this life.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   God in those moments of weakness that we have isn't afraid or isn't ashamed to come and encourage us.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   I love the picture of Jesus.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And so many stories in the Gospels coming and actually physically touching those who are ostracized.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The lepers and the sick and the blind.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Those who were deemed to be cursed by God because of their physical ailment.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And yet Jesus comes and lays his hand upon them.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And heals them and encourages them.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Why is God so concerned about our lives?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Well because ultimately he's the authority over us.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I think that's what Paul is ultimately going after.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   If you embrace God as a sovereign God over the universe and over your life,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   then you recognize that there's something looming for every single person that God is trying to protect you from.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That's where Paul ends this section.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   God is the authority of our lives.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   In verse 28, verse 26 rather, he said he set the boundaries of their habitation.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   In similar language, imaginatively speaking, where Job writes that God told the sea thus far you shall go and no further.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   We know that passage towards the end of Job.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Where God controls the sea and the waves and they stop where he tells them to stop.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   In the same sense, he controls the habitation of our lives.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   But there's a progress toward intimacy in Paul's passage.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   He starts out by God as the creator of the universe.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Then he moves to your life.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And then in verse 28 he says we are all his children.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Now it becomes very personal and very intimate.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Where now God sees you as a child that he has created and is caring for and is protecting and is leading with his hand.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   What he's doing here I believe is he's trying to use general revelation to pull us toward special revelation.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Because in verse 27 he says God did all this that they would seek him.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Perhaps they would grope for him and they would find him though he is not far from each of us.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   That is to say God is right there.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And God is using general revelation to pull people toward himself so they would become worshippers.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The worshippers of the true God.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   But as the author and the architect he now is the authority because of what we read toward the end of the passage.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And that is in verses 30 and 31.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   God is commanding man that everyone everywhere should repent.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Because there is a fixed day when he will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom he determined having furnished proof to all by raising him from the dead.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   In John 5 it says that there is only one judge and God has entrusted all judgment to Jesus.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   In Romans 2 verse 16 it says God will judge the secrets of man through Christ Jesus.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And that's the authority aspect that ultimately God will judge.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It reminds me of Job's cry back in Job 9.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   In verse 2 he says how can a man be made right before God?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Verse 15 he says though I were right I couldn't answer.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I would have to implore the mercy of my judge.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   In verse 28 in the same chapter he says I know that you will not acquit me.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Verse 29 I am wicked.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Verse 32 he's not a man as I am that I may answer him that we may go to court together.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Verse 33 there is no umpire between us who may lay his hand upon us both.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Do you see the desperation and the hopelessness in Job's cry?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I wish there was somebody who could actually stand next to me and defend me before God.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Because I am not his peer.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   There is no social parity between the two of us and I can't just show up to him or with him.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   There is no umpire between myself and God.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And that's what I think Paul is picking up here.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   He says there is a looming dark cloud of judgment coming.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I'm trying to rescue you from that moment.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And so what Job was crying out for Paul answers in 1st Timothy 2 when he says there is one God.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   One mediator between God and man.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   The man Christ Jesus.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   That's the answer to Job's request.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And this man Paul calls in 1st Timothy 1.1 our hope.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And the way he says it in the original is Jesus is the embodiment of hope.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Christ Jesus our hope.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   He wants us to understand that our hope is actually contained in Christ.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Which is why in Hebrews 6 we read it is impossible for God to lie.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   We who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   This hope we have as an anchor of the soul.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   A hope both sure and confirmed and one which enters within the veil.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Where a forerunner has entered for us Jesus having become a high priest forever.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   That's ultimately where hope is found.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So as we embrace God as the author, the architect and the authority of our lives.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   We do that first of all for ourselves.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Every single day in whatever is happening.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   But I would say secondly as you so faithfully are at the forefront of a very difficult environment.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Yesterday I got a text from a friend of mine who is a fireman here in LA.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And he said his superior told him to fly the gay flag today.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I just got a text a few moments ago right before I walked in.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   He said because it's drizzling they decided not to raise the flags.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And he begged me please pray.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Have people pray for me.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   That's God's answer right isn't it?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I hope we don't just say well that's coincidental.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   No there is an answer where God protected my friend from having to wrestle in his conscience.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   What do I do?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And he did for at least 24 hours.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But that's where you are.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I'm sure you have your own stories where God is leading you and you are in moments of difficulty.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Trying to make decisions about faithfulness at work and faithfulness to God.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   But if we embrace God as the sovereign one we can trust him.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   That everything is coming from his good hand.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Which is why I would like to end this from a prayer from the Puritans.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   The prayer is called the God who is the source of all good.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   The heavens, oh Lord God who inhabits eternity.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   The heavens declare your glory.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   The earth thy riches.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   The universe is thy temple.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Thy presence fills immensity yet thou hast of thy pleasure created life and communicated happiness.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Thou has made me what I am and given me what I have.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   In thee I live and move and have my being.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Thy providence has set the bounds of my habitation.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And wisely administers all my affairs.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I thank thee for thy riches to me in Jesus.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   For the unclouded revelation of him in your word.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Where I behold his person, character, grace, glory, humiliation, sufferings, death and resurrection.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Give me to feel a need of his continual saviorhood.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Subdue in me the love of sin.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Let me know the need of renovation as well as of forgiveness.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   In order to serve and enjoy thee forever.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Impress me deeply with a sense of thine omnipresence.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   That thou art about my path, my ways, my lying down, my end.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   That should be our prayer.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   If we embrace God who is sovereign over every detail in our lives.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   I'll pray to that God now.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Thank you God for being sovereign.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Thank you that we can embrace every detail trusting you that you saved us.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And you are sustaining us.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And so we appeal to you even now as we start this day.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   That you would continue to bless every speaker.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Every session.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Every conversation.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   So that as we are encouraged and equipped.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   We would be more faithful in our environment to the honor of your name.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Amen.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
