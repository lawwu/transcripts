[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Today, we have a question from a listener named Max who asks about whether or not Old
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.400]   Testament saints were under the impression that the Mosaic Law was achievable by a sinner.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600]   Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.560]   I greatly enjoy listening to your resources and have grown in many ways from your deep
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.600]   love of Scripture and knowing the God who breathed it out.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.640]   I have been reading Deuteronomy and chapter 30 verses 11-14 caught my attention.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   It states that the commandments in the book of the law are "not too difficult for you."
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   Thus, because obedience is attainable, they were forbidden from asking this "who will
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.560]   ascend to heaven for us?"
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.040]   Deuteronomy 30 verse 12.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.280]   That's as anti-Christological as it gets to tell people not to expect someone to ascend
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.480]   to heaven on their behalf.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.840]   But I'm also aware that Paul uses this passage in Romans 10 verses 6-8 to explain righteousness
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.160]   based on faith.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.620]   Based on the context of the beginning of Romans 10, I'm curious of your thoughts regarding
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.920]   whether God in chapter 30 of Deuteronomy was giving the Israelites the notion that their
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.480]   righteousness would be based on faith or that following the commandments of God perfectly
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.000]   was actually achievable.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.360]   So achievable, a Savior wasn't needed.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   Pastor John, how would you solve this conundrum for Max?
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.200]   I don't think the Bible anywhere, Old or New Testament, encourages us to believe that perfect
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.680]   obedience in this life is possible.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.280]   Even where law-keeping was held out in the Mosaic law as required for God's salvation,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.120]   the sacrifices were put in place precisely because of the inevitable disobedience.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.200]   But I would add to this that both in the Old Covenant, the Mosaic law, and the New Covenant,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.460]   secured by the blood of Jesus, obedience is required.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.880]   Only there are two different ways to require obedience.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.600]   One is this, salvation by law-keeping requires obedience, indeed perfect obedience, as the
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   basis of our salvation.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.120]   That's never going to happen.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.200]   If we want to try to be saved by law-keeping, Galatians 5:3 says, "Have at it, and you've
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   got to keep the whole law," and it isn't going to happen.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.880]   So salvation by law-keeping is a dead-end street; by the law comes death.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   The other is that salvation by faith also requires obedience, but not as the basis of
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.600]   our salvation, but as the evidence and confirmation of it.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.360]   Now here's the most important thing I can do, I think, in response to this question.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.600]   Let me see if I can paint the big picture of the Old Testament Pentateuch, because that's
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.280]   going to explain this passage in Deuteronomy.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   The big picture of the Old Testament Pentateuch, that is the first five books of the Bible,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.640]   and show the contrast between salvation or righteousness by faith versus salvation or
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.080]   righteousness by law-keeping.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.760]   In other words, what I want to show is that this tension between righteousness by law-keeping
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.320]   and righteousness by faith is not found just between the Mosaic law and the New Testament
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   gospel.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.720]   So that tension between law and gospel is not just found between Old and New Testament
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.360]   or between Mosaic law and gospel, it's found right here in the Pentateuch itself.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.560]   Genesis at the front end and Deuteronomy at the back end both highlight righteousness
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   by faith, and in between, Excellus Leviticus and Numbers, the heart of the Mosaic law,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.720]   highlight righteousness by law-keeping.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:34.380]   But both of them treat obedience to God as essential only in two very different ways.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.920]   Righteousness by law-keeping treats obedience as the basis of our right standing with God,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.480]   and righteousness by faith treats obedience as the result and confirmation of our right
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.400]   standing with God.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.640]   So let me illustrate this from Genesis and Deuteronomy, and this will explain, I hope,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.140]   how I understand the text that he's asking about in Deuteronomy 30.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.280]   The fundamental statement of righteousness by faith in the Pentateuch is Genesis 15.6.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.400]   Abraham believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.040]   Paul makes a big deal out of that text, and then he says in Galatians 3.17, "The law,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:33.560]   which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God so as
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.720]   to make the promise void.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   For if the inheritance comes by law, it is no longer from promise, but God gave it to
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.760]   Abraham by a promise, namely, to be received by faith."
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.880]   And Paul sums up the law that he has in mind when he says, "the one that comes 430 years
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880]   later."
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.160]   He sums it up like this in Romans 10.5, "Moses writes about the righteousness that is based
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.960]   on law," and then he quotes Leviticus 18.5, "that the person who does the commandments
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.720]   shall live by them."
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.680]   So Paul contrasts righteousness by faith from Genesis 15.6 with the righteousness through
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.560]   the law in Leviticus.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.640]   So in the Pentateuch itself, there is the gospel way of righteousness by faith and the
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.020]   law-keeping way of righteousness through the law.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:41.900]   But long before law came, Genesis made plain that Abraham's obedience to God was essential,
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.220]   not as the basis of his right standing with God, but as a confirmation of the righteousness
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.880]   that he had by faith.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:57.140]   For example, Genesis 26.4, God says to Abraham, "In your offspring, all the nations of the
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.660]   earth shall be blessed."
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.500]   That's the promise that he believed by faith back in chapter 15.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:11.300]   And then it says, "That will come because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.700]   my commandments, my statutes, my laws."
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:21.060]   In other words, the promise that Abraham had by faith in Genesis 15 is confirmed by his
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:28.980]   obedience to the law in Genesis 26, as much as God revealed it to him and as much as he
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.980]   knew it.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.180]   Same thing in Genesis 18.19, same thing in Genesis 22.16.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.740]   Then after the giving of the Mosaic law with its emphasis on righteousness by law-keeping
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:50.060]   comes the book of Deuteronomy with the chapter that Max is asking about in this question.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:57.260]   And what I'm arguing is that just as Genesis taught the righteousness by faith confirmed
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.780]   by obedience, that's what Deuteronomy 30 is about as well.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:09.580]   And the clearest signal is that in verse 6, you get a prophecy of the new covenant that
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:15.860]   will be more fully prophesied in Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36, and then fulfilled when Jesus
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:22.660]   lifts up the cup at the Last Supper and says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:31.220]   So verse 6 of Deuteronomy 30 says, "The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:39.940]   heart of your offspring so that," this is the effect of God's sovereign inner transforming
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:47.940]   by the Spirit, miracle working, "so that you will love the Lord your God with all your
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.980]   heart and with all your soul, that you may live."
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:57.460]   Now that, I would argue, that verse, verse 6 of chapter 30, is a description of the righteousness
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.980]   that comes through faith.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.980]   Why?
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.460]   Because you can't earn this by works because the works are the very thing that the circumcision
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.700]   of heart is making possible.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.120]   The only way to embrace this promise is by faith.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:21.860]   So this is a promise from God that he will put his people right through the blood of
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.740]   the new covenant by faith.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:31.920]   So when three verses later we read, "The Lord will again take delight in prospering you
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.060]   when you obey the voice of the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.420]   which is a clear echo of the new covenant promise three verses earlier, we see again,
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:54.020]   just like in Genesis, the necessity of obedience not as the basis of our right standing with
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:01.460]   God but the confirmation of it made possible by the circumcision of our hearts, which comes
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.900]   through the blood of the covenant before we can do anything to deserve it ourselves.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.540]   We can only receive it by faith.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.140]   Then finally, he was wondering, "Are you ever going to get to my question?"
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.380]   Then finally comes the passage that Max is asking about.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.780]   Let me read it.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.820]   So this is verse 11, two verses later.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.980]   "For this commandment," the one you're obeying now in new covenant faith, "this commandment
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.340]   that I command you today is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.460]   It is not in heaven that you should say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.860]   to us that we may hear it and do it?'
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.820]   Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.100]   bring it to us that we may hear it and do it?'
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.260]   But the word is very near you.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:58.460]   It is in your mouth and in your heart so that you can do it."
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:04.700]   In Romans 10, Paul sees these verses, he quotes them explicitly in Romans 10, 6-8.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:12.580]   He sees them as pointing to the righteousness of faith in contrast to the righteousness
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.700]   that comes through law-keeping, which he cited in verse 5.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:25.740]   Because he sees, just like we do, that Moses is writing about new covenant reality, things
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:32.020]   God is going to do sovereignly in the heart of his people through the forgiveness of sins
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.500]   by the work of the Holy Spirit in the days of the Messiah.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.260]   So here's my summary.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.180]   Here's what I think we've seen.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:47.100]   Genesis at the front end of the Pentateuch and Deuteronomy at the back end both draw
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.700]   our attention to the righteousness that comes through faith.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:58.460]   And sandwiched in between is the Mosaic law, which came in 430 years after Abraham, and
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:04.140]   it does not nullify what was taught as the righteousness of faith.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:13.080]   So in both Genesis and Deuteronomy, obedience to God from faith out of love is required,
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.520]   but not the way obedience is required for the righteousness by law-keeping, not as the
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.340]   basis of our standing with God.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:30.260]   Rather, obedience enabled by this new covenant inner work of the Spirit, blood bought by
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:38.540]   Jesus in the new covenant, this obedience is required in a new covenant way as the fruit
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:47.060]   of the Spirit written on our hearts and confirming not creating our right standing with God.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.060]   That was a lot.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.060]   Oh, my lot.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:56.700]   And that's what we kind of expect, I guess, in this podcast, a lot in each and every episode.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.860]   Thank you, Pastor John, for investing so much of your time and thought into each episode.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   And thanks for listening today.

[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:25.060]   Well, the comforts and the wealth of this Western world that most of us live in can
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.740]   be a blessing and they can be a deadly curse, too.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.620]   So how can we be freed from Western materialism?
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.380]   So important.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.020]   That question is up next time on Wednesday.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
