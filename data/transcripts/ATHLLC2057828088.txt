[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.840]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440]   and each week I sit down with the world's best experts
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.740]   to learn the strategies, tactics, and frameworks
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.040]   that shape their success.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.260]   Now, one of the things about money
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.000]   that I've always been fascinated by
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   is how wealthy people manage their finances
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.920]   and invest their money.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.880]   And thanks to today's guests,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.980]   I've been able to peek behind the curtain.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.720]   I'm talking with Tad Fallows,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.580]   who's become an expert on the topic
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.200]   since co-founding Long Angle,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.080]   an online community for high net worth investors.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.400]   It all started when his company was acquired in 2016,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.040]   and he and his co-founder were abruptly confronted
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.200]   with a bunch of personal finance questions.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.700]   So they created Long Angle,
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.920]   which has grown to become a diverse group of 1,000 members
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.200]   and offers a private online community
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.940]   where people can discuss a wide variety of issues
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.680]   from asset allocation to taxes, philanthropy,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.560]   insurance, raising kids, and more.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.440]   The community has no membership fees,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.200]   no advertising, and no selling of member data.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.240]   I wanted to invite Tad to join me
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.840]   to shed some light on the money and investment habits
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.260]   of wealthy investors
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.040]   by walking through the 2022
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.320]   Long Angle Portfolio Benchmarking Survey
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200]   that he's releasing today
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.600]   to break down the mysterious world of alternative assets
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.200]   and teach you about some of the assets
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   you might never have considered.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.320]   Also to share some of our favorite real estate
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480]   and home buying hacks and a lot more.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480]   So let's get started after this.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.360]   - Hey, everybody.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.760]   In my conversation with Tad,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.280]   we talk a lot about alternative assets,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.640]   one of which is crypto.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.660]   And in light of all that's going on right now,
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.600]   I wanted to share a few things.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.520]   As some of you know,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160]   BlockFi was a previous sponsor of the show
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.080]   and I use their platform to store all my crypto.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.520]   I liked that they were domiciled and regulated in the U.S.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.120]   And personally, I spent a lot of time talking to their team
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.000]   and reading their transparency reports
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.520]   to maintain my comfort using their platform
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.620]   for a meaningful amount of our money.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.160]   I'm recording this on the morning of 11/15
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.600]   and after the downfall of crypto exchange FTX,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.520]   BlockFi put a hold on all customer withdrawals,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.960]   leaving many people, myself included,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   with lots of their crypto on the platform.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.320]   Although BlockFi publicly communicated normal operations
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.040]   during FTX's collapse, that is no longer the case.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.120]   Yesterday, BlockFi said they did not have a majority
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.480]   of their assets custodied at FTX,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.440]   but that they still have significant exposure to FTX
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.060]   and their related entities.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.180]   They also said that there are a number of scenarios
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.400]   that may be available to them
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.500]   and they're doing the work now
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.580]   to determine the best path forward.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.780]   I honestly don't quite know
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.260]   what to make of those statements yet,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.700]   but I'm really angry about the way this was all handled
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.340]   and communicated and I am certainly not happy
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.440]   about the financial situation they've put me
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.940]   and many others in.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.740]   As for what I'm gonna do about it,
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.060]   I've taken screenshots of all of my balances
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.620]   and I've downloaded my full transaction history.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.460]   At the end of the day,
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.600]   I truly hope that they're able to find a way
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.440]   through all of this
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.760]   that results in everyone getting back their money.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.160]   And given all of this,
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.600]   I hope that a big takeaway from today's episode
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.440]   is that while many investors are seeking
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.000]   to add alternative assets like crypto to their portfolio,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.400]   the entire category comes with more risk
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160]   than most traditional investments
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.460]   and should only be considered
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.080]   for those comfortable with that risk.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.120]   All right, let's get on to the episode.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.040]   - Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.180]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.380]   are solely their own opinions
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.760]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.800]   This podcast is for informational purposes only
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.560]   and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.960]   - Tad, welcome to the show.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.840]   - So excited to be here.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.160]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.000]   - Yeah, so I'm gonna just start and ask you a question
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.280]   and we'll get into a lot of why you're an expert here,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   but what do you think the most common misconception is
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.320]   around how wealthy people, high net worth people
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.560]   are spending and managing their money?
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.480]   - I don't know if this is a misconception or not,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.140]   but what struck me is different
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.240]   from honestly the way I do things myself
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.320]   and the way I see a lot of other people do things
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.360]   maybe who are not in the high net worth demographic
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.000]   is how light on debt they are.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.520]   We do a benchmarking survey where we look at overall
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.400]   how people allocate their portfolios
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.120]   and how much debt they hold and that sort of thing.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.640]   And I would say a full 50% of the members of our group
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.440]   don't have any debt of any sort on their house.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.560]   A quarter of them don't own a primary residence at all
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.120]   and then another quarter own their residence outright.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.360]   And I think it's 80% of members
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.060]   have less than 25% of their assets is debt.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.020]   To kind of put that in concrete terms,
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.300]   if you had 10 million of assets,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.180]   it would mean that you had less than 2 million of debt.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.700]   And I think if you look at general stats
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.500]   about the American population, et cetera,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.180]   you've got a much higher debt to assets ratio
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.860]   than you see among this group.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.340]   And it's not that it's a risk averse group.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.780]   These are people who have started companies,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780]   work at hedge funds, work in venture capital,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.660]   people who are willing to take a lot of risk.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.220]   But I think one of the reasons
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.180]   they're comfortable taking that risk
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.180]   is they go quite light on debt or leverage,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.340]   however you wanna phrase it.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.400]   - We're gonna get to this benchmarking survey,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.080]   but I just wanna talk a little about LongAngle.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   So can you talk a little about what it is
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.820]   and why you started it?
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.660]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.240]   So I started this group about two years ago
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.320]   with my friend Sriram.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.800]   We've been friends actually since,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.960]   I think freshman year of high school.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.360]   I remember watching the Smurfs with him
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.440]   after school some days.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.280]   But what led us to start this is that shortly after college,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.720]   we were both in consulting and then decided
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   we wanted to kind of give it a try ourselves
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.440]   of starting our own company.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040]   So we started a software company
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.520]   and we ran that for about 10 years and we bootstrapped it,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.180]   which means we basically didn't take
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.700]   any outside venture capital.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.540]   And in practical terms,
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.180]   it meant we didn't make any money ourselves
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.500]   or didn't take any salary out of it.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   We just rolled every dollar we made back into the company.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.760]   And then after about 10 years,
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.740]   we were fortunate enough to sell it to a strategic acquirer.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.900]   So it meant from a kind of a personal finance dimension,
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.300]   we made no money until our mid thirties.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.140]   And then on one day,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.260]   we got our compensation for the last 10 years of effort.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.420]   And so we were quite abruptly introduced
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.780]   to all these high net worth personal finance things,
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.040]   whether it's estate taxes, alternative assets,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.860]   umbrella insurance, et cetera.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.820]   For a variety of reasons,
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.260]   we didn't want to go the model of just saying,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.860]   hey, Goldman Sachs, here's all my money.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.420]   You guys are in charge, you take it from here.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.380]   We wanted to sort of manage things ourselves,
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.100]   but we realized we had a lot to learn.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.660]   So we basically wanted to set up a group of friends of ours
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.980]   who are all in a similar situation financially
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.540]   and where nobody was trying to sell each other anything.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.940]   And that's really still what we're doing.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.180]   I think our initial expectation,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.940]   this would just be a couple dozen friends
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.580]   and sort of our first or second degree circle.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.940]   It ended up that need was a lot more broadly felt.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.740]   And so, you know, people introducing their brother,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740]   their co-founder, their board member, et cetera.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.860]   We've grown to about a thousand members
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.740]   all across the US and growing share in Europe,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.660]   Australia, Middle East, et cetera.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.660]   We're not looking to like recreate LinkedIn or anything.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.900]   So we either share them or myself
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.140]   interviews every potential member
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.860]   to kind of see what they're interested in.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.100]   Not that we are trying to have
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.780]   one cookie cutter member profile of,
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.220]   hey, everybody's an early forties software entrepreneur
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.540]   with two little kids.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.300]   We want as much diversity as we can get
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.100]   professionally, geographically, et cetera,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.540]   provided everybody's on the same page
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.300]   around the non-solicitation and confidentiality.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.780]   - When I came across Longigo,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.500]   which I think I found in like a Reddit thread on Fatfire,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.580]   which we can get to later.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.420]   I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.220]   this is exactly something I'm interested in, right?
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.620]   It's a community where it's private,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.860]   so you can be transparent.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.980]   There's no fake profiles, there's no anonymous.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.500]   Everybody goes by their name
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.660]   and talk about every aspect of life.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.940]   So I've been really excited to be a member.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.220]   I've learned a ton.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.700]   I've tried to do my best to give back
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.580]   and share what I know, but I'm so curious.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.540]   You said a thousand members.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.180]   You've done probably half of those interviews, at least.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.780]   What kinds of things have you learned
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.820]   talking to all of these people who kind of fall into this?
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.460]   Where's the threshold for who's a member
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.580]   so people kind of get a sense of the profile
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.020]   of members of Longangle?
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.860]   - So say the typical demographics of our group,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.740]   almost everybody's in their thirties and forties.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.780]   The bulk of people are in what banks would call
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.820]   the very high net worth demographic.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.900]   And that means between five and 30 million
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.020]   of investable assets.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.780]   We've got maybe another 15 or 20% on each side of that.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.780]   We do validate that everyone's at least a qualified client.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.740]   And the SEC defines that as having 2.2 million
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.820]   or above in investable assets.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.180]   And that's really just a threshold that sort of governs
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.700]   what kind of assets you're allowed to invest in.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.020]   So those are the kinds of people
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.540]   that I've had these discussion with.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.140]   I think there's a few things
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.220]   that have come as surprise to me.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.060]   Well, first I would say,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.140]   I've just really enjoyed these interviews.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.100]   I've met 500 fascinating people.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.700]   And maybe the biggest thing I've learned
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.620]   is there is no one path here.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.140]   We've got members who started cybersecurity companies.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.300]   We have members who were employee number three
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.540]   at Pick Your Public Company,
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.100]   people who work at hedge funds,
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.340]   people who work in real estate, corporate executives,
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.580]   people who put one paycheck into crypto back in 2011,
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.580]   people who inherited money.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.060]   So I'd say one thing is there's a lot of paths
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.300]   to significant financial success.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.260]   The second thing is I don't think any of our members
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.540]   feel like they "have it figured out."
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.220]   I think if you look on a personal level,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.860]   probably 80% of our members have little kids.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.180]   And I don't think anybody feels high confidence
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.980]   that they know the right way to raise kids with wealth.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.060]   I think there's this balance of,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.180]   hey, having significant resources
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.340]   creates these opportunities.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.660]   I can get private tutors.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.740]   I can help them pay for whatever activities
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.580]   they're interested in,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.860]   get them private gymnastics lessons, et cetera.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.580]   So there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.460]   But I think there's this real tension of,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.060]   first, I don't want to spoil my kids
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.260]   and just have them not turn into good people.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.580]   And second, I don't want to deprive them
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.220]   of their ability to feel they've succeeded
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.820]   on their own terms and struggled
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.540]   and figured out the right way to do things.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.060]   I think that's something where, unfortunately,
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.540]   I don't have, hey, here's the answer about how to do it.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.540]   But I do think if people are worried
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.220]   that they're not sure how to strike that balance,
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.740]   they're far from alone.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.660]   And I think beyond that specific question of kids,
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.780]   I think even people who have achieved
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.340]   quite a bit of significant success financially
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.940]   feel like from a pure personal finance perspective,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.660]   there's some big gaps in how they do things.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.940]   Maybe it's, hey, I've heard about umbrella insurance
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.780]   and I know that's a thing,
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.620]   but I don't know what it is or how much I should buy
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.780]   or where to buy it.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.860]   Or maybe it's, hey, I've got no trust in a state plan.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.140]   Again, I know that's a thing.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.580]   If I keeled over tomorrow,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.940]   my assets would go into probate.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.500]   That could cause all kinds of problems,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   but I don't know where to start
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.380]   or how to wrap my head around this.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.420]   Or maybe I'm all in cash and can't bring myself to invest.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.460]   For each person, it's different,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.180]   but I would say most people feel like
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.740]   they have some real gaps and don't have it figured out.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.620]   And finally, the last thing that actually just gave me
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.900]   a lot of personal comfort is I would say 80% or 90% people
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.700]   feel like they are the one sucker really paying their taxes.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.140]   I think there's this impression of, hey,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.460]   everybody out there is moving to Puerto Rico
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.940]   and doing 1031 exchanges and doing all these clever things
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.580]   that ends up with effective no tax rate.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.820]   But the significant majority of people feel like,
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.500]   hey, I'm paying 30% plus in effective taxes
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.340]   and haven't figured out the way around it,
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.260]   which personally I think is actually not a bad thing.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.300]   It just makes me feel better
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.860]   about being in that same situation
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.460]   to know that most people are paying their share.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.140]   - Well, one, now I feel a lot better.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.340]   I'm also paying my share.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.380]   You know, as much as I love to find the tax hacks,
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.220]   it seems like it makes me feel better.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.820]   I guess unless I talk to people in real estate
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.700]   that seem to always say they're not paying taxes.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.100]   I thought the misconception you might say at the beginning
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.140]   was that, you know, everyone thinks
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.820]   that the wealthy have it all figured out.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.740]   And if there's something I've learned being in the group,
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.300]   it's like people are open about the fact
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.460]   that they haven't figured it out.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.060]   And I like that.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.660]   Someone listening might say, well,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.740]   is it just staying within the bubble of the wealthy
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.580]   and all this knowledge?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.780]   And I think things like this,
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.540]   and we're gonna talk about your benchmarking survey,
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.940]   like hopefully are an opportunity
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.420]   to kind of get some of that information out.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.460]   But I know that where they're not a closed door ecosystem,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.020]   people might not be as open to sharing.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.620]   So it's this catch 22 of if you made it open
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.540]   for anyone to come,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.260]   you might not actually get the conversation going.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.580]   But if you close it, how do you get that information out?
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.620]   Any thoughts on ways to share some of the knowledge
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.940]   that's coming out of a group like this with more people?
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.300]   So people that aren't there have a higher likelihood
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.940]   of getting to that group in the future?
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.580]   - Yeah, I think it's a fantastic question.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.620]   And I think you're right, there is this tension there.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.140]   So one of the guiding principles we put in place
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.940]   is this idea of confidentiality,
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.980]   because we do think that having a real names policy
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.300]   and people actually being who they purport to be
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.220]   is really important,
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.780]   but people are just not gonna open up.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.660]   It's one of those things
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.900]   that people just don't talk about money.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.220]   And I would say, at most wealth demographics,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.220]   that's not unique to the high net worth.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.300]   As you said, for example,
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.460]   we do this annual benchmarking study.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.380]   And what we do there is we ask all of our members
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.740]   to put in a spreadsheet
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.500]   across 60 some different asset classes,
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.860]   how their portfolios break down in percentage terms,
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.300]   not absolute dollars, but across these asset classes.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.820]   And then we synthesize all that data and normalize it,
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.540]   correlate it with a bunch of dimensions
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.100]   and create a report around that.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.900]   That's something that actually we publicize
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.740]   and share with everybody.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.940]   So anybody who wants that data
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.060]   is certainly welcome to access it.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.980]   I think going forward,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.500]   it's a great idea to think about other ways
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.460]   that we can look to share things
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.260]   that don't compromise confidentiality.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.020]   I think there's always gonna be certain things
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.660]   and first person anecdotes that just can't be shared.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.980]   We're looking to do more synthesized and aggregated data.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.660]   And that's not something that I would look to prevent
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.300]   being more broadly disseminated.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.260]   Once a week, we'll do what we call the mini benchmark
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.820]   in the forum where I ask one question,
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.300]   just give four possible answers.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.700]   And that can be anything from
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.140]   what do you expect interest rates are gonna top out at?
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.420]   How much allocation do you have
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.260]   to emerging market securities?
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.020]   Do you use Wealth Manager or not?
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.140]   And I think that's a great idea.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.100]   We can maybe just tweet the results of those out
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.780]   to anybody who follows us on Twitter.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.140]   The one about Wealth Manager, actually,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.860]   you'd asked earlier what might be surprising.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.220]   And one thing also that's surprising to me
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.260]   is I personally don't use an RIA or Wealth Manager.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.460]   I had been under the impression
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.460]   that I was sort of the oddball in that approach.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.500]   But actually, if we look at overall membership,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.660]   only about 40% of people have any sort of third party,
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.700]   whether it's a multifamily office,
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.740]   RIA, Wealth Manager, et cetera.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.180]   About 60% of them do not.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.900]   And I think it mostly comes down to,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.700]   biggest thing is probably just this fee structure
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.220]   of paying half a percent or 1% of your assets every year.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.380]   Just people both, I think, don't really like the idea
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.220]   of paying a percentage
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.020]   as opposed to just paying straight dollars.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.740]   So like, "Hey, I pay my lawyer by the hour.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.700]   "I pay my account by the hour.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.700]   "Why can't I pay my Wealth Manager by the hour?"
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.060]   And then just the absolute number.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.180]   If somebody has $10 million, paying 1% of that
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.820]   means you're paying $100,000 a year,
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.620]   which is just quite a bit of money.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.140]   So that was another surprise to me
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.380]   is that I was not in the minority of saying
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.340]   that I'm just gonna do things myself.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.300]   I think if I look at our membership,
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.860]   you get to a certain level and I aspire to be there,
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.780]   but not there myself.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.860]   If you're over, say, 50 or 100 million,
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.020]   I think it just starts to get to this level of complexity
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.300]   that even just managing the paperwork
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.580]   and dealing with the tax returns,
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.260]   you really can't do that by yourself
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.940]   unless it's really your 100% job.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.700]   So people do hire and help to that.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.900]   But below that kind of level, I'd say most people,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.100]   at least in our group, are managing everything themselves.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.060]   - And managing it yourselves doesn't mean
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.580]   you don't have an assistant or you don't have a bookkeeper
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.180]   or you don't have someone that files your taxes.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.580]   It just means you're not paying someone a percentage
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.340]   of all of your assets to manage your investments.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.340]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.140]   I would say almost everybody has a CPA
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.060]   who's doing their taxes and that can be
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.580]   a very reasonable amount of money.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.020]   Somebody can be making $2 million a year
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.900]   and only pay 1,000 or 2,000 a year
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.100]   for somebody to file their taxes.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.340]   It does not need to be a back-breaking amount of money.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.500]   And I actually think at a certain point,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.220]   it's just silly not to hire somebody else to do it
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.740]   because you can have all the good intentions in the world,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.580]   but it's really easy to misread the tax code
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.980]   at a certain level and either underpay or overpay.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.700]   And I'm not sure which is worse.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.220]   I don't think people want to be doing either one.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.340]   So certainly, as you're saying, yes,
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.180]   bookkeepers and assistants and that sort of thing.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.580]   But I think just this principle of saying,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.700]   I'm gonna pay somebody a half a percent or a percent a year
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.500]   just to tell me to put something into a 60/40 index fund.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.820]   I will say our group tends to be younger, as I said,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.100]   in their 30s and 40s and overwhelmingly 95% of people
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.420]   didn't grow up with this kind of wealth,
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.740]   but generated themselves at some point along the way.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.300]   So I think probably has a relatively high dose
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.940]   of self-confidence in their ability to do it.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.980]   So probably a bit of selection bias there,
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.140]   but it's not a unconventional approach.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.620]   - One thing when it comes to taxes,
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.860]   even if you don't want to hire a CPA forever,
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.580]   I would encourage everyone to hire someone for one year,
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.020]   or even I found that as part of a sales tactic,
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.420]   most of the accountants I've talked to to file taxes,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.420]   when you get to know you, they say,
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.220]   "Hey, why don't I review your last year's return?"
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.660]   And you're still within the window of being able to refile
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.780]   if you mess something up.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.700]   And I wouldn't say I found any glaring mistakes
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.020]   from when I was doing it myself,
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.540]   but even when I hired a firm that was kind of not that great,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.180]   the next firm I ended up hiring was like,
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.340]   "Well, here's a couple things
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.340]   you could have done differently."
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.260]   And so I found that at almost all levels,
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.780]   hiring someone to do this pays for itself
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.660]   in what they're able to understand and file for you.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.860]   So I think that if I filed my taxes myself,
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.260]   forgetting the time it would take,
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.140]   I would actually end up not filling out the right things
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.980]   and ending up making less at the end of the year
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.380]   than I would if I paid someone.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.100]   - I agree, and I think there's also value
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.620]   to have somebody throughout the years
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.660]   you're trying to make decisions,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.180]   you can bounce ideas off of.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.300]   So for example, we own a home in Southern California
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.540]   we used to live in, and we've moved since then.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.980]   And I'd sort of like to sell it
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.300]   'cause it's just sort of a hassle to manage,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.460]   but then I had concerns about,
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.420]   "Okay, if I sell it,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.540]   is that gonna have big tax implications?"
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.260]   And having somebody who I've worked with
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.540]   for a number of years knows my whole situation,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.620]   so I can send her an email saying,
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.060]   "Hey, I see these options here.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.420]   I could sell this and do a 1031 exchange
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.500]   and then defer sort of indefinitely paying taxes on it,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.700]   or I could just sell it, but I'm worried
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.660]   I'm gonna have this big gain
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.540]   that's gonna be taxed under California tax rates
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.180]   and it's gonna sort of wipe out the whole point of doing it."
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.900]   And somebody who has that whole context,
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.620]   she was able to easily identify, say,
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.580]   "Okay, well, you've got these passive losses
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.700]   you haven't been able to take and you can net these out."
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.100]   And really, it's not just a matter
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.660]   at the end of the year of getting accounting right,
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.580]   but she was able to help me make better decisions
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.420]   along the way and say,
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.540]   "Hey, here's what the tax implication will be
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.540]   when you're filing your returns next year if you do this,
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.940]   but here's this other way of structure it
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.500]   that is just as good economically,
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.980]   but it's gonna be a lot smarter way to go about it."
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.300]   - You mentioned the benchmarking survey,
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.780]   and one of the things I think is really interesting
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.700]   is that so many of these benchmarking surveys exist.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.620]   If you search Schwab RIA Benchmarking,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.740]   you get a lot of them,
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.420]   but they all are tied to some brokerage firm or some RIA.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.540]   And so the results end up looking very similar
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.140]   to whatever that investment advisor
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.220]   is recommending their clients do.
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.100]   And so I don't feel like it's as practically useful
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.180]   for anyone other than like,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.860]   if I wanna steal clients from this RIA,
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.420]   I now know what their clients look like.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.940]   But your benchmarking survey, like you said,
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.020]   60% of people don't even have wealth managers,
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.260]   is really fascinating.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.260]   So I thought maybe it'd be fun
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.340]   to go through some of the learnings.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.780]   I think anyone listening would certainly be educated
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.700]   in many ways about what are all these people doing?
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.260]   How are they structuring their portfolios?
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.500]   What are they thinking about debt,
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.980]   leverage, all this stuff?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.540]   So maybe we could just run through it.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.140]   Like you mentioned, it'll be available.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.740]   So I'll just link to it in the show notes
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.180]   if people wanna go take a look at it and follow along.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.780]   But maybe we could just walk through it and talk about it.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.540]   - The way that we run this, to be clear on that,
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.540]   is that we share it with all of our members once a year.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.140]   We share the survey.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.380]   And we define something like 60 to 65 different asset classes
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.740]   and ask people to put in how their personal portfolio
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.020]   is allocated across these different kinds of assets
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.580]   and these different kinds of debt.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.860]   Then we gather all that data together.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.420]   And we also know a lot of other demographic data
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.220]   about our members, how old they are,
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.620]   what was their source of wealth,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.980]   where do they live, all of that sort of thing.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.420]   And we now have a big enough N
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.460]   that we can actually correlate across those things,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.700]   not just say, okay, on average,
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.780]   people have this much money invested in private equity,
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.300]   but say, okay, compared to people who are younger or older
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.900]   or more or less money in total,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.460]   how does that affect their allocation
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.860]   to different asset classes?
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.620]   So that's sort of how we go about it.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.900]   I know that radio is not the best medium
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.180]   for talking about a lot of numbers.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.020]   So I'm not gonna get into exactly what percentage point
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.940]   to each one, but happy to talk about
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.700]   sort of a few high-level takeaways here.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.580]   As I said, I'd encourage people to look at the link
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.260]   if they wanna see more details.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.460]   I'd say at the highest level,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.060]   in terms of how people's portfolios are allocated,
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.580]   it is roughly 1/3 into public stocks or public equities.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.980]   So that's anything, whether US or international,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.580]   buying Microsoft, Apple, et cetera,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.020]   mostly via index funds,
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.540]   but it could also be individual shares.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.300]   It's about 1/4 into equity in real estate,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.140]   whether that's somebody's primary residence
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.220]   or whether that is investment properties,
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.380]   vacation homes, commercial buildings,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.580]   warehouses, what have you.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.860]   And then about 1/4 into alternative assets,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.500]   which could either be private companies they hold,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.460]   could be crypto.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.300]   We can get a little bit more later into the show
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.140]   into what alts are, but about 1/4 into alternative assets.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.420]   And then the rest, about 15% into cash and bonds.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.620]   In terms of changes that we've seen over the last year,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.340]   you can see there was a big drop
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.100]   in terms of shares and public equities
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.020]   that went from about 1/2 of people's portfolio
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.580]   down to just 1/3.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.260]   And what made up the difference was more in real estate
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.100]   and more in alternative assets.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.140]   - And do you think that some of that
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.740]   is just the market was down
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.700]   a pretty significant amount between years
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.140]   or do you have any kind of qualitative data around this
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.860]   to understand how much of it was market-driven
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.180]   versus portfolio structure-driven?
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.100]   - I think it was both.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.100]   I don't know if I can break down exact percentages,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.020]   but yeah, the fact is the market's down
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.980]   something like 20% over the last year,
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.620]   whereas the real estate market's gone down
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.380]   a little bit lately, but it's probably up
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.900]   and alts have also done well.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.740]   So I think some of it's market-driven,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.740]   but yeah, your question about qualitatively,
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.420]   I can say with confidence that people,
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.460]   partly 'cause we asked in the survey,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.860]   what are you personally doing to change your allocation?
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.860]   And that is something people are intentionally doing
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.700]   of feeling like the environment that we were in before
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.860]   was not the one we're in now.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.060]   And so something like real estate, for example,
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.060]   two years ago, that was probably a fantastic buy.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.180]   You had 2.5% debt that you could get on things
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.660]   and very reasonable expectations of inflation
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.140]   at two to three times that level.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.860]   So that was a real smart move to do.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.300]   I'd say today, something like real estate is less attractive.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.460]   Again, higher interest rates
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.580]   tend to make public stocks less attractive.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.780]   So I think we are seeing people intentionally
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.260]   trying to increase their allocation,
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.660]   especially to alternatives.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.380]   And then a couple of other sort of to dive into the details,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.020]   things that people may find surprising.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.460]   I think I mentioned earlier on here
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.540]   that about a quarter of our members
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.900]   don't own their own home.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.460]   And I would say for almost everybody, that is by choice.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.340]   It's not a matter of if you've got $5 million,
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.100]   you could afford to buy a house.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.140]   But again, asking people qualitatively,
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.740]   why don't you buy a home?
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.780]   I would say it probably falls into two categories.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.460]   There's a set of people who just don't wanna live
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.460]   in any one place.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.220]   Now these often tend to be the people without kids,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.380]   but they're nomads and say,
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.540]   "Okay, I wanna be in Mexico City for the next three months.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.100]   Then I wanna be in Switzerland.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.740]   And I just don't see a point in owning a house if I do that."
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.900]   And then there's also a lot of people
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.540]   who just don't want the sort of mental burden,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.900]   the time burden, the financial risk, et cetera,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.780]   associated with owning.
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.900]   They would rather just rent and know I'm gonna pay this.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.540]   And if the lights need to be changed, the plumbing breaks,
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.060]   the roof leaks, that's not my problem.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.140]   I'm just gonna call the landlord
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.100]   and tell him to deal with it.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.980]   That's a big thing.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.180]   And then if you look at the three quarters of people
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.700]   who do own a home, again,
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.860]   a quarter of those don't have a mortgage on it.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.020]   So you have pretty much fully half of members
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   without a mortgage.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.340]   So I found that interesting.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.380]   And another thing on the personal real estate,
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.940]   leaving aside the caveat I had
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.620]   that there's a material percentage of people
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.500]   who don't own a home.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.780]   If you look at those who do, up to about $50 million,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.180]   the home continues to be a pretty significant piece
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.100]   of people's net worth.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.420]   If you get somebody who's a billionaire,
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.580]   of course their primary residence
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.660]   is probably not a big part of their portfolio,
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.620]   but somebody could have over $25 million
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.100]   and still have 10 or 15% of their net worth in their home.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.740]   So that's something else that's interesting to me
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.060]   is how much people's primary residence value
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.260]   continues to scale along with their net worth.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.500]   First, I wanna point out,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.820]   I'm a big fan of the fact that Ramit Sethi
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.820]   spends a lot of time telling the world
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.780]   that renting is not the worst thing in the world.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.420]   And I love that you're seeing that here.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.100]   And this is another message that's reinforced.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.260]   I know so many people that think that renting a house
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.620]   is just throwing away money.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.420]   I've spent a lot of money on property tax.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.180]   I've spent a lot of money on insurance.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.140]   There's a lot of costs that come with owning a home
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.300]   that end up getting thrown away.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.900]   Mortgage interest being another one.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   So I wanna make sure we pause for a second
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.300]   and reinforce the fact that renting is not a decision
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.460]   that is something that means you won't make money.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.220]   It means you're throwing all your money away.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.140]   I've done the breakeven analysis
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.020]   and built spreadsheets to figure it out.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.940]   If you look at the costs
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.260]   and you look at the cost of mortgage interest and all stuff,
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.260]   I generally think that if you're not in a house
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.860]   for more than five years,
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.940]   all the money that you're spending to buy a home
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.620]   and the brokerage fees, everything,
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.860]   you're also throwing away
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.820]   and you actually would have been better off renting.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.460]   Now, there are a lot of factors that play into this
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.980]   that who knows if rents are gonna rise,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.300]   who knows what happens to mortgage rates
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.220]   and home prices and appreciation.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.180]   But my rule of thumb has always been less than five years,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.260]   owning actually doesn't make sense.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.380]   And if you think, oh, I could stay in the place I am
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.660]   for the next 10 years and you buy a place,
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.700]   but you buy a place that's so big
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.340]   that it will work five to 10 years from now,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.980]   but it's actually way bigger than you need
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.060]   for the next one to five years,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.980]   you're effectively overpaying.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.860]   And if you were renting,
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.100]   instead you might rent a one or two bedroom,
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.940]   but now because you wanna adhere to this five year rule,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.540]   you buy a four bedroom,
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.500]   then you're also still gonna come out behind
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.620]   because for the next three, four or five years,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.020]   you would have saved so much money
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.380]   renting the one to two bedrooms.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.700]   I just try to take every opportunity I can
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.180]   to reinforce the fact that buying is not the end all,
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.780]   best path forward for everyone.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.140]   And renting certainly,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.020]   while you don't get to recoup that money,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.940]   you also have a lot of expenses associated with buying
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.940]   that you don't get to recoup.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.180]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.020]   And I think the other thing I would say is
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.380]   when you're looking at real estate,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.860]   not only should you look at how long should I stay there,
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.060]   but it really matters
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.380]   what is the economic environment I'm buying in.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.180]   And by that, I primarily actually mean
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.220]   what's the interest rate you're paying.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.660]   If you buy a house in cash, it's not a bad investment,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.020]   but nobody is becoming a multimillionaire
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.420]   by buying property in cash.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.060]   The reason that real estate often turns out
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.740]   to be a very good investment
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.580]   is that you're putting in 20, 25% of your own money
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.740]   and 75, 80% of somebody else's money.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.340]   In that case, if it goes up 5%,
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.060]   you're seeing a 25% return on your money.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.900]   And that's great.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.060]   Over the past five years,
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.260]   I've actually personally been buying a lot of real estate
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.180]   and trying to take on as much of that leverage as possible,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.940]   but that is not a universal answer.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.620]   That was the case when interest rates
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.380]   were down at two or 3%.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.020]   And I think anybody who is looking at government policy
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   and that sort of thing knew
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.500]   that inflation was gonna be a lot higher than that.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.060]   That's not the environment we're in anymore.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.100]   Rates have gone up 3% over the last number of months,
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.620]   and you're seeing the highest average mortgage rates
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.780]   we've seen in the last 20 years.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.980]   So you can still take on debt,
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.380]   but you're paying way more for that.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.180]   And so it's unlikely to be that same wealth generator now.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.220]   So I think you need to look at your own situation,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.060]   but also just look at
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.860]   what's the overall economic environment.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.220]   And this doesn't just go for real estate.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.740]   This goes for other asset classes.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.420]   If you look at bonds two years ago, I didn't hold any.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.020]   In my opinion, that was a terrible investment.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.180]   If you look at something that's a 30-year bond
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.540]   that's yielding 2%, there's no uncertainty.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.460]   Mathematically, if you hold that to maturity
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.180]   over the next 30 years, you're going to earn 2% a year.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.420]   And there's near total certainty
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.660]   that inflation's gonna be higher than that.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.980]   So you're basically locking yourself
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.900]   into losing money over 30 years.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.100]   Now that environment by the flip side
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.420]   has become a lot more attractive.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.700]   Personally, I still don't buy bonds
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.940]   because I'm not that compelled by a 5% rate or 4% rate,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.300]   but that's way better than the 2% you had before.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.780]   So I think across any asset class,
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.900]   there's not one universal, hey, here's the right answer.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.220]   Here's a portfolio that makes sense.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.020]   You have to be somewhat reactive
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.820]   to the situations you see it.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.900]   Unfortunately, you only get to sort of live your life once,
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.820]   and it may be that ideally when you're 28,
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.020]   you'd like to buy a home,
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.500]   but it's not a great environment to buy a home.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.260]   You just have to kind of react to that fact,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.380]   but you need to look at a combination
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.060]   of what's going on internally and externally for you.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.980]   Being a parent can be scary,
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.460]   whether it's watching your toddler
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.380]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.620]   or the indescribable pain of stepping
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.500]   on tiny plastic dinosaurs in your bare feet,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.340]   both of which happened to me recently.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.180]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.780]   is getting life insurance,
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.580]   especially when you do it with Fabric,

[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.380]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.380]   and found Fabric to be highly competitive

[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.580]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.260]   not available in certain states,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.000]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.860]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.380]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.260]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.340]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.300]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.260]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.220]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.980]   take care of the supplies.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.800]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.660]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.060]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.020]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.500]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.580]   that you got through another week.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.700]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.220]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.000]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.100]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.740]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.320]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.300]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.340]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.180]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.220]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.860]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.340]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.420]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.280]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.300]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.540]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.100]   I will also add right now,
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.080]   'cause I know there are people,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.500]   especially in my friend group that are like,
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.480]   I finally have the money for the down payment,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.500]   but interest rates are so high.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.500]   I will say two things.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.960]   One, I have noticed even in the Bay Area
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.660]   that there've been a lot of price decreases.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.460]   So if you factor in the fact
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.900]   that you might get the house a lot cheaper
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.140]   than you would have a year ago, that could be an impact.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.580]   And then the second is you're never locked into 7%, right?
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.060]   If you get a mortgage right now and it is 7%,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.460]   and hopefully for the sake of those people
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.740]   that that comes down quickly,
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.720]   like if mortgage rates drop back down in three years,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.480]   you can always go ahead and refinance.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.960]   And so, funny enough, I had been doing some calculations
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.120]   when I was trying to decide whether we got
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   a 30-year mortgage or a 10-year mortgage.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.020]   And I was looking at the break-even point
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.880]   on the 10-year mortgage.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.120]   And it's not 10 years.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   In my worst case scenario math, I was saying,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.900]   okay, well, at the end of the 10-year period,
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.120]   rates go up to 7%.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.640]   And now I'm paying way higher than 2 1/2
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   or whatever I would have done on the 30-year mortgage.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.080]   And the break-even point was still like 12 or 13 years.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.640]   And so what that meant was,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.880]   if I had gotten a 10-year mortgage and paid,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.840]   let's say, half a percent lower
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.640]   than my 30-year fixed for 10 years,
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.860]   and then it rose up to 7%,
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.320]   the savings I got for those first years
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.720]   was totally made up for by even having to pay 7%
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.560]   for three years.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.160]   So if you inverse that and say, if I get a mortgage now,
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.200]   and for three years, I have to pay 7%,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   and then after that, I can refinance,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.080]   like the net effect over a decade or more
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.160]   is not gonna be as impactful.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.640]   I have not done any math, this is not financial advice,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.800]   but probably not going to outweigh the fact
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   that you might be able to get the house
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.200]   at a significantly better deal right now
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.480]   because so many people are scared off by mortgage rates.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.720]   - Yeah, I would agree with that.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.840]   The only other hack I would add
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.960]   in the world of buying a house,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.640]   so I bought three houses since my wife and I
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.840]   have gotten married.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.480]   And we have followed the same strategy on all of them.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.880]   And I've been very happy with the purchase on each one.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.960]   And that has basically been looking for houses
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.040]   that have been on the market for a year, two years,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.680]   and they came on way too high, nobody wanted it.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.600]   And so then after a while, they started cutting,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.800]   they kept cutting and kept cutting.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.440]   And to the point where when we bought it,
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.080]   in each case, it was about 30% below
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.900]   where they'd originally brought it on.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.920]   And I am confident that any one of those,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.120]   if they had brought it on
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.760]   just at the right price at the beginning,
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.120]   it would have sold right away,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.760]   it would have sold for more than we paid.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.880]   But you start to get this dynamic
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.200]   where a house just gets stale.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.400]   The most recent one we bought,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.880]   it was actually a vacation house in Southern California
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.700]   near my brother.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.520]   I was really excited about this opportunity.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.680]   We'd been working with a realtor for a while there
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.520]   and couldn't find anything that sort of
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.920]   was what we were looking for,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.680]   as price we could afford, et cetera.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.360]   Till finally my wife, she was on Zillow said,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.200]   "Hey, what about this one?
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.020]   This looks amazing.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.560]   This has great ocean views,
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.920]   has exactly what we're looking for.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.760]   And you know, this price seems super reasonable."
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.820]   And we talked to our broker, she said,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.320]   "No, you don't wanna see that,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.400]   it's been on the market forever."
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.240]   And so we pushed her, you know,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.080]   like we really do wanna see it.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.600]   She was like, "Ah, it's hard to show,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.720]   tenants there are messy."
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.240]   I was like, "Why on earth would I care
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.320]   the tenants there are messy?
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.100]   Like, I'm not looking for tenants,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.400]   I'm looking for a property."
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.720]   Anyway, we finally got into it, finally saw it,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   and we bought it.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.120]   And then afterwards, she's saying,
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.600]   "I don't know why this thing was here.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.800]   This thing should have gotten a heartbeat at,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.240]   you know, 20% higher than this."
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.320]   That is a strategy, as I said, it wasn't a one-off.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.880]   It's been all three houses we bought,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.240]   just this idea of a stale house is no longer hot.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.840]   And then people just get spooked by it.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.480]   They say, "Hey, if it's been there for a year or two,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.320]   there must be something fundamentally wrong with this house.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.000]   There's a reason nobody else wants it."
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.920]   And then you just get these sellers
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.800]   who keep having to do these little salami slices
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.160]   of cutting 3%, 5% at a time,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.760]   and end up well below the market.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.120]   My two house buying hacks,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.440]   one that we've done for both,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.920]   one that we've done for one,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.600]   was earlier in our careers, we were like,
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.080]   "Well, we knew that we wanted to be in a house
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.240]   for a long period of time if we wanted to buy it,
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.600]   because you kind of needed that for the math to work."
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.840]   But we also didn't want a pre-buy space we didn't need.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.160]   So we found a house that had three bedrooms,
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.720]   but it had a private entrance for one of the bedrooms.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.920]   And we basically converted that to a studio
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.080]   and rented it out.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.280]   We locked the door from the inside
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.400]   between that bedroom and the rest of our house.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.360]   It didn't have a kitchen,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.040]   but in the Bay Area, there are lots of young people
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.600]   who either work at a company
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.880]   that provides them all their meals,
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.680]   or don't mind cooking in a microwave
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.600]   and going out to eat and all of that.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.360]   And so for almost a decade,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.280]   we rented a room out in our house.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.920]   And then right about the time
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.720]   we were about to have our first daughter,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   we were like, "You know what?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.080]   We need that third bedroom now."
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.360]   And we are in a financial position
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.880]   to not need the rental income anymore
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.040]   to make the mortgage payments.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   Now, all of a sudden we're like,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.800]   "Now we've just upgraded
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.320]   from a two bedroom to a three bedroom,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.680]   but we didn't have to move."
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.280]   And we had that extra income.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.960]   So right now, that could be a great opportunity.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.360]   And at the time, it seemed so crazy to me to think,
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.760]   "What if it didn't have a door?"
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.320]   Now, knowing everything I know,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.480]   the cost to cut a hole in a house and put a door
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.240]   is probably actually not as much as I thought.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.400]   So I think early on,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.240]   I was only looking at houses that were set up for this.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.640]   Knowing what I know now, you could look for any house.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.080]   And relative to the cost to buy a house,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.400]   the cost to cut a hole and put a door
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.280]   is actually gonna be pretty insignificant.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   So it doesn't even have to be perfectly situated for this.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.720]   It could just be perfectly situated
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.480]   for you to make that modification.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.760]   And then the second one,
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.800]   which most people have told me is a terrible idea,
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.760]   but I've done it twice and I like it.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.440]   So this is again, not advice for you,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.840]   but I've gone to a house
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.560]   that we found the house we liked ourselves.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.480]   We found it on Redfin or Zillow or somewhere.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.840]   We went and looked at it.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   And then we convinced the selling agent
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.160]   to be our agent also, which is called a dual agency.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.280]   And so the seller's agent now represents
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.880]   both the buyer and the seller.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.280]   They have to get permission from the seller to do this.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.120]   And if you find someone that you reasonably would trust
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.240]   to act fair and impartial,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.040]   because they're legally required to do that.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.360]   You have both the law,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.240]   but also you want someone that you feel like
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.720]   can ethically handle that circumstance.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.280]   You end up in a situation which they make two commissions
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.680]   if you buy the house and they make one commission
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.560]   if anyone else buys the house.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.200]   So I will say they are very motivated
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.600]   for you to buy the house.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.720]   As a seller, I don't know if I would ever do this.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.280]   Maybe I would do it if I could agree
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.400]   that the agent would rebate a significant part
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.840]   of that commission back.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.160]   But as a seller,
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.360]   I don't want someone to be motivated by one buyer.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.280]   I want someone to be motivated by the highest price.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.200]   As a buyer, I would much rather want an agent
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.680]   who's motivated to sell to me than anyone else.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.360]   And so in both scenarios,
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.400]   we were able to close a purchase contract
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.200]   before other higher offers came in.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.480]   In some cases by hours and in some cases by a day,
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.400]   but we were able to make an offer on the house we're in now
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.280]   before it went on the market and have it accepted.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.800]   And the backup offers that came in
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.000]   were higher than our offers,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.120]   at least as best I understand it, so.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.200]   - Yeah, I like that hack and I would build on it.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.080]   I think that works the way you did it.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.840]   That works great in a competitive market
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.640]   where the challenge for you is to actually get the buy.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.280]   I think if you say, hey, maybe today's market's not so high.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   I've got time.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.600]   It's more of a buyer's market
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.080]   or maybe a more balanced market.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.760]   But I think you can easily flip that around.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.000]   And I haven't done this myself,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.920]   but I have a friend who's done this several times
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.040]   where he'll put in an offer and he'll write into his offer,
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.600]   I'm not represented by an agent.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.840]   And part of my offer is that the seller
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.000]   is no longer paying a 6% commission.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.600]   They're only paying a 3% commission.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.040]   So he's basically saying, hey,
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.960]   when you look at my offer here
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.160]   and maybe I'm bidding 970,000,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.760]   my competitor is bidding a million,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.040]   but you, Mr. Owner, are gonna net the same amount
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.720]   because I am explicitly stating
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.480]   that that commission goes back to the seller,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.520]   then I think that you can basically get a lower price on it.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.680]   Again, it's not something I've done,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.760]   but I think it's the flip side.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.120]   If it's not a competitive market,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.480]   if it's more of a buyer's market,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.600]   you can use that as a way to find a lower price
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.000]   that's not gonna hurt your seller.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.120]   - When we did it the first time,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.360]   the second time this didn't work,
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.000]   but the first time we convinced the agent
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.200]   to rebate 1% of their commission back to us,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.440]   meaning one of the 6%, not 1% of their overall thing.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.800]   So we were able to bid a little higher
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.280]   because we were getting it back.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.760]   I've never thought about what you just described,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.560]   which is like, just take the commission out
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.760]   and then you can offer lower.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.320]   So those are fun hacks,
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.120]   especially if you're buying a house in this market
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.480]   and wanna try to find a way to get the best deal.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.840]   So we were talking about real estate
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.680]   as part of your portfolio.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.440]   We talked about what happened to stocks.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.560]   Let's talk about a few of the other interesting things.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.800]   And I think alternative assets is one,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.440]   maybe because I have a lot of questions there,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.280]   we could start with cash and then jump to alternatives
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.440]   'cause I think we could spend a bit more time there.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.080]   Anything you learned particularly interesting about cash
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.920]   or anything else that we've kind of missed
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.080]   when we talked earlier?
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.360]   - Yeah, I would say that
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.040]   if you think of conventional financial advice,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.680]   it would probably look like a 60/40 portfolio,
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.280]   60% stocks, 40% bonds.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.040]   If I look at our typical member,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.480]   and so again, we're talking about people
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.320]   with five to 30 million,
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.880]   their typical portfolio is only 15% cash
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.040]   plus bonds altogether.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   There's just been very little appetite historically
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.960]   for those instruments.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   Now that could be different.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.640]   Now the interest rates have tripled
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.120]   over a past number of months.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.280]   If we run this next year,
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.760]   we might find that bonds become more interesting.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.240]   But to date, I think people keeping
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.800]   very little cash and bonds.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.720]   And part of the flip side of that
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.280]   is probably not having much debt either.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.320]   It's saying, "Hey, I'm not gonna take a lot of risk here
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.400]   "and put a lot of leverage in my portfolio.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.640]   "But by the same token, what I'm putting my money into,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.160]   "I wanna have a high expected return.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.200]   "I'm not happy with the expected return of 2%.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.960]   "I wanna get 10% or 20% or something like that."
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.360]   Apologies if I'm taking a little field
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.840]   from your question here.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.400]   But if I think about how people
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   have been very successful financially,
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   look at investments differently than conventional advice
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.160]   and what sort of leads this lower bond allocation,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.800]   I think there's historically been this notion,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.720]   I'll call it driven by the investment industrial complex
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   that volatility and risk are the same thing.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   And I think that is just the wrong way to look at it.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.600]   So you look at terms like a Sharpe ratio
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.280]   and a Sharpe ratio is a way that people often look
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.360]   at assets like hedge funds or something like that
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   and say, "How good is it?"
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.280]   You don't just say, "What is the typical rate of return?"
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   But it basically divides that rate of return
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   by the volatility.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.240]   So say, "Hey, if option A returns 20, option B returns 10,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.160]   "but option A is twice as volatile as option B,
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   "then effectively they're just as good as each other."
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.160]   You can choose how much risk you're willing to take
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.320]   and then you get proportionally rewarded in your upside.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.920]   But I think this idea of volatility and risk
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.000]   being the same thing,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.200]   I personally just don't follow that in my portfolio.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.240]   I think if you have an amount of money
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.360]   that say you don't need it until retirement,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.240]   so that could be 10, 20, 30 years away,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.560]   what matters to me much more is how much money
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.200]   am I gonna have at age 70 when I wanna retire
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.560]   and not how smooth is my path to age 20.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.760]   Not that I don't care at all,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.240]   everyone of course is somewhat emotional,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.280]   is not gonna be happy about seeing a million dollars
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.760]   go down to 100,000, then jump up to 5 million,
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.160]   but you're much better off ending up at 3 million
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.440]   than having it in a bond going from a million
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.920]   to a million one to a million two
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.120]   and ending up only a million and a half in 30 years
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.320]   rather than the 3 million.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.040]   And so this idea that risk is very real,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.120]   but I see risk much more as what is the chance
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.960]   that in the end I'm gonna have a permanent loss on this,
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.480]   a permanent impairment of capital.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.920]   And these are not new concepts for me.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.120]   Warren Buffett talks about it in these same terms,
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.640]   the risk that you permanently lose this money,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.480]   not just how much does it bounce around in the interim.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   And that would be something that I would encourage
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.040]   everybody to think about is,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   especially if you do work as a financial advisor,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.560]   I'll give an anecdote.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.160]   When we sold our company,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.000]   and I was talking to a number of financial advisors,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.440]   one of the big name, high profile banks,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.080]   I was talking with actually a good friend of mine
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.400]   who works there, he's a wealth manager,
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.120]   and he was sort of giving their pitch.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.640]   He said, "You know what we can do for you?
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.680]   "We can give you half the return of the stock market
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.720]   "at a quarter of the volatility."
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.840]   I said, "Why would I want that?
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.760]   "Why don't you give me twice the return of the stock market
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.960]   "at the normal volatility?"
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.520]   And he just looked at me like I was crazy,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.360]   like, "No, that's not what we do.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.640]   "We give you lower returns and lower volatility."
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   I think that's fine if you have a known need for this.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.840]   You know, if you're sending your kid to college in two years
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.360]   and that money needs to be there,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   and it's no good for you that you'll have money in 10 years,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.200]   well, then you shouldn't take risk with it.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.720]   But I think a lot of your listeners
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.920]   are probably earning good salaries
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.520]   in an active savings phase,
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.320]   and if they're younger and earlier in their careers,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.040]   are gonna be in a savings phase for decades to come.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   I would encourage them,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.200]   unless that they know that they personally
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.680]   just don't have the risk appetite
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.640]   and are gonna panic and sell in a downturn,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.040]   unless that that's the case,
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.760]   just not to be as worried about near-term volatility.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.720]   And I think there's less panic selling
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.480]   than people are led to believe.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.640]   I think it's in the interest of the financial advisors
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.800]   to sort of say, "Hey, if you're going into these things
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.720]   "by yourself and you're going to these risky asset classes,
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.640]   "you are gonna panic the next time .com bubble happens
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.080]   "or next time a great financial crisis happens."
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.160]   But that's not universally true.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.040]   That's some people, but that's not everybody.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.480]   I think there's a lot of people who can just say,
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.800]   "I'm gonna set on autopilot.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.080]   "I save 1,000 bucks a month, and I never look at that,
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.600]   "and I just check my portfolio once a year
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.800]   "and hope it goes up."
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.440]   - The good news, this is not good news for our accounts,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.280]   but in the last, I don't know, three years,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.360]   we've had what happened when the pandemic started,
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.840]   people that were invested in equity
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.800]   saw their portfolio crash,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.760]   and you can ask yourself, "How did I react?"
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.400]   And if you were able to hold back your fear and not react,
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.880]   well, now you've been able to test yourself.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.480]   Now we're again in like a double-digit,
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.920]   20 plus percent correction in the stock market.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.480]   And then anyone who's held basically any amount of crypto
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.920]   in the last handful of years
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.480]   has probably had a separate, sometimes correlated,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.680]   sometimes uncorrelated, 50% haircut in that market.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.360]   So a benefit to young people today,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.760]   I'm gonna pretend I'm young right now,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.000]   is that these things were things
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.920]   that some people didn't see for 10, 20 years.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.840]   And now we've seen two in the public stock market
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.640]   in the last two years.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   And so people have really gotten to understand
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.840]   how they feel and even understand
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.960]   how they felt the first one
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.360]   and now see how it changed in the second one.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.480]   And I think that's something that historically,
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.280]   people have needed maybe 20 years to find out.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.080]   And now we're fortunate, I guess,
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.160]   maybe not right now with our portfolios being down,
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.000]   but we're at least fortunate
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.680]   that in a very short period of time,
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.360]   we've gotten two opportunities to see how we would react
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.400]   and what happens and understand our own appetite
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.320]   for risk and short-term volatility.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.280]   And for me, I don't love logging in
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.920]   and seeing that my portfolio is down 20%,
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.720]   but the portfolio is down 20%.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.040]   I don't need now.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.480]   So you can get caught up and say,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.200]   "Oh man, my net worth is down."
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.840]   But it's like, I'm not trying to withdraw this money
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.680]   to spend it now.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.040]   So maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.080]   One thing we didn't touch on
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.440]   before we talk about cash and alternatives
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.880]   is the balance between indexes
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.680]   and individual stock investing.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   And I'm a little curious what you've seen
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.600]   in the long-angle community with this survey
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   of people kind of trying to pick stocks and pick winners,
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.520]   which is, I know often a thing that people are told
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.640]   you can't do, but then you're like,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.920]   "Well, Warren Buffett's doing it."
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.800]   What are people in the community doing here?
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.400]   Yeah, I would say they're probably picking
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.760]   a lot fewer individual stocks than you would expect.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.280]   We did ask of your total public equity exposure,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.600]   how much of that is in index funds versus individual stocks.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.440]   And the significant majority is index funds.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.320]   And I would say those individual stocks,
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.960]   they often tend to be employer stocks.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.160]   I was a employee of X company before it went public
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.360]   and I've got a lot of shares,
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.120]   or I just get every year as part of my compensation package,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.240]   I get a certain number of shares
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.840]   and haven't gotten around to sell them.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.520]   So I would say that there is not a lot
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.840]   of individual stock picking.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.200]   Now, of course, nothing's universal.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.280]   There are the guys who love it,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.160]   but in general, I'd say that for their public equity exposure,
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.720]   people go diversified.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.440]   Now, the one plug I will put in favor
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.600]   of individual stock picking,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.840]   and I do a little bit of this,
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.280]   not that I think I'm great, but mostly for fun,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.120]   is to your point around,
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.000]   "Hey, the market went down 20%, I feel 20% poorer."
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.280]   I think that's largely a perception
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.160]   of people's relationship with a stock
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.840]   is just this number on the screen.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.160]   But the more you're actually thinking about,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.800]   "I own one, one millionth of a percent of Apple,
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   and that's the thing I own.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.040]   I don't own a share of Apple that today is worth a hundred,
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.120]   tomorrow is 140, but I own this little share
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.320]   on their future income."
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.680]   You sort of know intuitively,
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.760]   Apple didn't just become 20% or 30% less valuable.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.600]   This is just sort of the market pinging around
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.680]   or a more extreme case.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.080]   Facebook did not lose 75% of its value
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.000]   over the last six months,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.360]   even though the price went down 75%.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.680]   So I actually think it's not that harmful.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.520]   If you're somebody who enjoys it,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.160]   I wouldn't just put all your eggs in one basket.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.000]   But if you wanna buy a sort of balance
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.800]   of 20, 30 different stocks,
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.320]   you're almost certainly just gonna track the overall index.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.160]   But if either you find that a fun diversion,
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.400]   it's something that you enjoy,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.960]   and maybe that's like a form of spending.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.320]   So rather than going on a fancy vacation,
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.080]   you're spending by investing in these stocks.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.840]   It's not a bad thing financially,
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.440]   but especially if it makes you more comfortable
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.280]   and a draw down,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.920]   because you can really just look at a profit
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.760]   and loss statement and say,
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.840]   "Hey, P&G sold 3% more tie this year than last year.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.680]   So I don't really care that the market's down
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.200]   because they're still paying their dividends.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.640]   They're still making tide.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.200]   Exxon's still pumping oil."
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.560]   I think that can actually be really helpful.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.840]   People sort of ride out some of this volatility.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.720]   - But to your point about Warren Buffett and picking stocks,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.240]   I think that's exactly how he talks about it.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.360]   He says, "Don't look at my market to market.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   Just look at what is the operating cashflow
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.440]   of the businesses we own,
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.880]   and sort of do a look through basis.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.120]   I own 5% of Apple,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.480]   and that made X billion dollars of profit next year.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.920]   So that's what I think it's worth,
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.960]   not what I could get if I happened to sell
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.240]   all my Apple shares today."
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.960]   - Let's move to the topic of alternatives,
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.880]   'cause I think it's something
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.520]   that seems so mysterious to people.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.680]   In some ways, even just through the long angle community,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.920]   I've started learning like,
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.120]   wow, even I felt like there was a lot more that I knew.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.760]   So maybe if you could give a little bit of an overview
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.000]   to people listening on what you even mean by alternatives,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.680]   what does that whole space look like?
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.880]   And then we can talk a little bit about
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   how to think about them, when to think about them,
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.120]   where to get them, what kinds, and all that.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.880]   - Awesome. I'm super excited to talk about this.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.560]   I think this is just a really interesting asset class.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.440]   So first of all, I'll say alternatives is a very broad term.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.400]   At its highest level,
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.720]   it means really anything that is not stocks, bonds,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.440]   cash, or real estate.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.360]   Now, some people will call real estate an alternative,
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.800]   but I don't think it really belongs there.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.680]   But it's basically everything else.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.360]   So when I talk about it here,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.320]   I'm sure you'll have somebody writing in,
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.160]   listing 10 different alternatives I left out,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.520]   because pretty much anything you can think of
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   putting your money into, you can define as an alternative.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   But it's everything except those conventional ones.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.240]   They tend to share a few characteristics.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.080]   I would say they tend to be less regulated.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.480]   When you're buying stocks or buying bonds,
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.240]   you have this whole infrastructure of the federal government
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.040]   and the Securities Exchange Commission
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.680]   and all these rules and courts
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.800]   that make sure that you have full information
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.240]   and every company has to publish their quarterly earnings
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.080]   or else the CEO and the board's gonna be sued
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:02.920]   and that sort of thing.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.120]   And there's a lot to ensure transparent information
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.720]   and effectively efficient pricing.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.400]   This is part of the reason that you can just go out there
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.760]   and sort of buy whatever stocks you want to.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.640]   And if you buy enough of them,
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.840]   you're probably just gonna track the index
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.480]   because there's good information.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.560]   But there is a lot less regulation
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.640]   and a lot less information alternatives.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.240]   In terms of less information,
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.160]   I can go out there today and find a list
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.920]   of every publicly traded company in the US
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.640]   and that's just an objective factual list.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.880]   If you said, "Hey, what is every alternative out there?"
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.280]   There is no list you can look at.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.000]   You can do Google searches and say,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.480]   "Okay, what's every hedge fund out there?"
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.520]   And you'll find different lists,
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.800]   but it's only gonna be people
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.120]   who opt into that hedge fund index.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.000]   And also they tend to be usually less liquid.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.960]   That's not universal.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.000]   Something like crypto, I can go sell it tomorrow.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.080]   It's very liquid market.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.360]   Or maybe foreign currencies,
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.360]   I can go sell those tomorrow, very liquid.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.560]   But a lot of them tend to be less liquid.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.920]   Just means it's a higher friction to buy and sell
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.360]   and longer holding periods.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.760]   Now, this idea of being less regulated,
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.720]   less transparent, less liquid, that sounds bad,
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.240]   but it's not necessarily bad.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.080]   There's both a good and bad on it.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.560]   The bad is that it is a lot more dangerous
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.240]   to be a naive investor in alternatives.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.800]   The good is that if you actually know
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.680]   what you're talking about,
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.240]   there's a lot more opportunity
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.160]   to sustainably have high rates of return.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.320]   Somebody tells you they're gonna buy public stocks
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.640]   and return 25% a year consistently with low risk.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.680]   I would just run away from that.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.840]   It's just not possible.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.520]   The market is efficient.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.840]   Any good news, good information
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.640]   just gets arbitraged away very quickly.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.960]   But in the alternative space,
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.320]   you can find a little niche
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.920]   where if you really understand it,
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.960]   the people you're partnering with are good.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.520]   Because it's not transparent, because it's not liquid,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.080]   you don't have trillions of dollars of capital
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.720]   flooding into that particular niche
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.360]   and arbitraging away the whole opportunity.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.960]   You can have consistent sustainable source of,
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.800]   it's called alpha,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.680]   or just a consistent above market rate returns.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.760]   And so I think it's extremely attractive.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.920]   And personally, I'm doing most of my investing there,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.480]   but it's one where you have to be more careful
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.720]   because you can either make a lot
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.880]   or lose a lot of money depending on how you do it.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.920]   If you wanna be happy to kind of get a little bit more
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.640]   into what some of the specific kinds of alternatives are,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.960]   classes and what to expect in each of those.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.160]   Yeah, I think that'd be really helpful
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.000]   and include some examples of some of the interesting ones
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.400]   that maybe people would have never thought of
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.240]   as an investment.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.680]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.160]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.760]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.200]   in your situation,
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.800]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.080]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.920]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.080]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.200]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.600]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.000]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.280]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.440]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.800]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.520]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.320]   are first-generation wealth,
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.400]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.520]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.880]   and learn from each other
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.480]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.800]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.120]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.540]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.680]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.680]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.160]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.600]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.240]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.700]   So many of these conversations
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.920]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.600]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.440]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.560]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.640]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.800]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.300]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.240]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.320]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.920]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.400]   and supporting the show.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.240]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.720]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.280]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.440]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.880]   And again, with the caveat that I'm sure
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.840]   I'm gonna be leaving out more than I mentioned here,
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.720]   I would probably put them into four big groups.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.240]   I think the first one is some sort of equity,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.040]   some sort of ownership in a business.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.600]   Now, typically, people think of stocks
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.280]   buying Microsoft or Google,
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.760]   but that's really only the biggest
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.000]   5,000 or 10,000 companies in the country.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   There's another multiple millions of companies
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.960]   in the country that are not publicly traded,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.640]   and so they're all accessed through
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.160]   some kind of alternative.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   And within there, I think there's some
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.760]   really interesting asset classes.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.200]   Maybe people are most familiar with angel investing.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.480]   It's basically at an idea stage,
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.640]   you've got a small team of two or three founders
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.120]   who want to build something,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.760]   and they're raising maybe half a million
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.280]   or a million dollars to sort of start hiring a team,
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.160]   start proving this concept works.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.800]   So that's very early stage, super high risk.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.000]   Most of those are gonna go bankrupt,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   but super high return.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.960]   If you happen to be the angel who invests in Google,
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.200]   you're gonna get 1,000 times your money back.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.600]   So that's angel.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.560]   You get a little bit further along in the process,
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.480]   and you move into what's called venture capital or VC.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.080]   And there, there's different stages.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.720]   The earliest stage is seed round,
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.400]   then you've got A, B, C, D, E, and so on.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.240]   As the companies get bigger and bigger,
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.800]   their valuation gets higher and higher,
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.360]   but the risk goes lower and lower.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.160]   Angel people often do themselves,
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.800]   and I would only recommend doing that.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.320]   If you work in technology or biotech or robotics
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.760]   or something like that, or AI,
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.960]   and people who are starting these companies,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   you have a lot of confidence in them,
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.400]   that's a great way to do it.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.920]   If you don't have as much access there,
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.880]   I probably would go light on that.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.720]   Venture capital is more traditionally done
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.200]   through venture capital funds.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   So you can think of a lot of big names there,
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.640]   like Sequoia, or there's a million of them,
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.360]   and often have a very good historical track record.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.600]   And those are the ones that are putting money
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.400]   into companies that are usually growing quickly.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.680]   They have some degree of proof that their model works,
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.000]   but they're not yet at scale.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.240]   And so they're giving them millions or tens
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   or hundreds of millions to basically scale up
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.720]   and reach their opportunity there.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.960]   Again, it's still risky
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.320]   compared to investing in a public company,
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.840]   but it's a lot less risky than angel,
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.720]   especially the further down the trail you get
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.840]   into these late stage series C and D and E.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.160]   The companies are fairly proven and mature,
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.640]   but you still have some upside there.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.280]   A third one is private equity.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.040]   And basically what private equity does
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.560]   is they're not looking to turbocharge these smaller companies
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.520]   but they're buying companies
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.320]   that are usually fairly mature companies.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.600]   Sometimes they're very profitable,
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.080]   sometimes they have some dents and scratches on them
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.040]   and need to be fixed up,
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.840]   but they're basically buying mature companies
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.360]   and they might take them private.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.840]   So a company that is publicly traded,
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.800]   they'll take it private.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.880]   Like if you think of Twitter,
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.560]   that being sample of a company taken private recently,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.760]   or they might just be buying them from the guy who started it
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.200]   or a previous private equity firm that bought it.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.040]   So buy it somewhere in private market transaction.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.280]   And their idea there is they'll usually put in
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.520]   some amount of their own money,
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.680]   maybe 25 or 50% of the purchase price,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.760]   then they'll borrow the rest.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.960]   And their idea is to run that company better
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.080]   and to throw off more cash.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.400]   And then eventually after maybe five or seven years
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.080]   to sell it to somebody else.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.080]   Those tend to also have very good historic returns.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.640]   If you think of VC maybe having the 20% plus returns,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.120]   I think private equity often the good ones
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.800]   can get in a similar return range there.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.720]   And again, that was almost entirely done
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.520]   through a fund or a third party,
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.760]   unless you happen to be somebody
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.480]   with an enormous amount of money,
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.640]   you can't personally take a company like this private,
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.880]   but you can invest in some of the big names
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.920]   or companies like KKR or Blackstone or Carlyle,
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   some of the better known private equity funds
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.760]   that hold many billions of dollars.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.800]   And then there's one other actually really interesting class
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.640]   of equity alternatives, which is search funds.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.000]   People don't know about this as much,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.240]   but it has one of the highest returns
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.120]   actually of any asset class out there historically.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.840]   Stanford does a lot of studies on this
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.640]   and they've been tracking it for more than 30 years.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.560]   And over that period,
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.840]   the average internal rate of return or IRR,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.760]   just the average return on money there has been above 30%,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.840]   almost consistently every year over the past three decades.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.600]   And basically the search fund model
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:02.320]   is that someone typically a new MBA graduate
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.800]   from some high end school like a Harvard or Stanford MBA
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.960]   will spend a year or two going and looking
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.680]   to find a small company to buy.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.320]   And they will get maybe half a million
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.600]   or a million dollars of backing
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.920]   from a number of investors to pay their own salary
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.800]   and pay their expenses
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.640]   as they're looking for this company to buy.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.440]   Then after a year or two, they've identified the company,
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:25.120]   they buy it often from the person who started that company.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.760]   And then they try and scale it up or run it,
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.440]   somehow improve it for five years or so.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.800]   And then they sell it off into another private equity company
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.880]   and this idea of basically buying it
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.360]   at a relatively low multiple from the founder,
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.920]   and then improving it and selling it at a high multiple
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.760]   to a follow-on private equity company
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.360]   has just almost like clockwork returned unbelievable returns.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.680]   This one, the flip side,
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.240]   and this is what I was talking about in general
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.600]   where alternative assets can be low information,
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.680]   hard to get into, but then really good.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.200]   Let's say search funds tend to be an example
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.560]   of that really good.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.480]   It's hard to get into,
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.000]   but if you find a good search fund sponsor,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.720]   you can see those kinds of returns.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.600]   And if I look at the deals that we have done
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.240]   within the long-angle community,
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.040]   that's probably some of the ones I'm most excited about
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.960]   are those search fund opportunities.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.240]   So we talked about sort of a class of equities.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.640]   I think there's also a class of commodities,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.520]   examples of that could be crypto.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.000]   That's probably one of the most accessible
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.480]   alternative assets out there.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.880]   If you're looking at a major coin,
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.640]   like an Ethereum or a Bitcoin
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.000]   or even anything in the top 10, top 20,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.440]   you can go buy that in Coinbase
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.160]   or really any marketplace for crypto.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.080]   And you're gonna get basically the exact same thing.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.600]   You don't need somebody's help to buy Ethereum.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.960]   You can go just do that yourself.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.440]   Another example of commodity might be like a whiskey.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.600]   And this is something that we've done a few deals
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.120]   and recently I've found it really interesting
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.760]   where there has been a pretty consistent appreciation curve
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.520]   where newly distilled whiskey
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   that's just put into the barrel,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.600]   or maybe I should say like Kentucky bourbon
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.800]   to be more specific,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.920]   will often be about maybe $1,500 a barrel.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.160]   And then when it's three years old,
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.800]   it's usually worth more like 3000.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.240]   When it's five years old, it's worth maybe 4,500.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.080]   And there's been this just very consistent
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.560]   and rapid appreciation curve.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.320]   And don't wanna spend too much people's time
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.120]   to talk about exactly why that curve has existed there.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.200]   But that's an example of something
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.600]   that I never would have thought before,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.400]   this idea of, okay, I'm buying a barrel
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.120]   or shares of a hundred barrels
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.480]   of newly distilled Kentucky bourbon.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.680]   But historically, if you have a good operator there,
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.160]   you can consistently see these
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.240]   really pretty exceptional rates of return.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.720]   And I won't say that that is totally uncorrelated,
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.440]   assets, especially in a down market
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.200]   tend to have some degree of correlation.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.480]   So when it's a bad market for public stocks,
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.880]   probably art, probably real estate, probably whiskey,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.200]   probably everything's gonna get hurt to some degree,
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.520]   but it's not perfectly correlated.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.160]   You're gonna get some benefit of that lack of correlation.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.760]   So commodities are another example.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:39.920]   Then there's a whole set of things
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   that are just around kind of complex financial structures
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.280]   where basically there's some stream of money or some asset
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.520]   that someone then wants to structure in a certain way
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.400]   and sell on to somebody else.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.960]   So I'll give you a more concrete example.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.400]   There's something called equity finance,
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.880]   where if you have someone who's lucky enough
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.560]   to be an early employee at a company,
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.840]   maybe it's like a private company,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.240]   but it's been quite successful.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.520]   So think of like a SpaceX or a Stripe
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.360]   or some private company that now their shares are worth,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.800]   let's call it $10 million.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.760]   That person may actually want some liquidity from that,
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.000]   but it's not a public stock today.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   So they can't just go and sell it
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.640]   through their brokerage account.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.960]   And also to actually realize the value of that
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.000]   to a stock option, to get a little bit into the weeds,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.960]   a stock option, if I actually wanna turn it from an option,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.320]   so-called exerciser, or turn it into a share,
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.160]   I have to spend a certain amount of money
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.720]   called the strike price to actually say,
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.480]   okay, maybe this share is really worth a dollar,
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.800]   but my option is to buy it at 10 cents.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.920]   Well, at a million shares,
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.840]   I need to now come up with $100,000
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.160]   to buy those shares at 10 cents.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.920]   I know it's a great deal 'cause they're worth a million,
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.960]   but I still gotta find the $100,000.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.560]   I can't necessarily sell them for a million here.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.680]   So what do I do?
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.160]   There's something called equity finance
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.440]   where a third party will go give that employee
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.400]   the $100,000 and tell them to use it
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.120]   to exercise these shares.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.920]   And that in return for that,
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.280]   you can negotiate however you want to,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.120]   but they will get some fraction of the upside on it
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.920]   and some shared downside on it.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.320]   So if that million dollars of share
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.960]   now doubles to 2 million,
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.120]   maybe the person who put in $100,000
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.560]   to allow the person to exercise their options,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.760]   maybe he or she gets 50% of the upside
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.640]   and the other 50% goes to the employee.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.200]   Those are just illustrative numbers,
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.680]   but this idea of a sort of structured financial arrangement
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.600]   where I'm putting in money to get a certain claim
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.480]   on a certain asset,
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.400]   there's an almost unlimited number of these.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.640]   There's also things called secondaries.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.480]   So basically anything that's in a fund,
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.440]   whether it's a real estate fund, a venture capital fund,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.520]   any kind of fund where there's not day-to-day liquidity,
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.520]   where you can't just go to the venture capital fund
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.720]   and say, "I want my money back,"
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.680]   because they'll say, "Well, too bad.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.960]   It's invested in private companies.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.000]   I can't give you your money back
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.880]   until those companies go public."
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.560]   I can turn around and sell it to you, Chris,
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.080]   and say, "Hey, Chris, I wanna sell you my stake
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.840]   in this Sequoia fund here.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.120]   I think the underlying assets are worth a million dollars."
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.960]   Typically these secondaries will have a discount
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.280]   and you'll say, "Well, I'll give you 800,000
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.480]   for that million dollars of shares in Sequoia."
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.440]   This is, again, across any of these asset classes,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.080]   this idea of secondary transactions
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.040]   at a discount to the underlying value
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.480]   is a very common form of settlements.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.880]   There's even more esoteric things
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.120]   like buying somebody's life insurance policy from them
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.800]   and assuming the premium when they pass away,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.640]   you get the money.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   I haven't done that particular one myself,
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.000]   but that'd be another example of structuring something.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.080]   And then finally, you've just got a whole grab bag
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.320]   of sort of esoteric approaches you can take.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.360]   For example, there's a professional athlete revenue share
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   where let's say somebody just signed a minor league contract
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.920]   and they don't have any money right now.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.600]   They're making very little on that,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.400]   but they're likely to become the next major leaguer
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.720]   and sign a very big contract,
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.920]   but it's gonna be quite a while out
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.040]   because they're gonna be in the minors
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.080]   for three years or five years.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.560]   And then the way contracts are structured,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.840]   the major leagues is your rookie contract,
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.240]   lasts another five years and it's not worth that much.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.920]   So they could be 10 years out
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.520]   from their high earning potential.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.240]   You could say, "Okay, I'm gonna give you $100,000.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.960]   "And in return, I want 2% of your salary
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.120]   "should you make the majors.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.280]   "If you don't make the majors, I've lost my money.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.940]   "You got $100,000, that's the risk for me.
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.420]   "But if you do make it and I get 2% claim on it,
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.180]   "if you sign a $100 million contract,
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.380]   "now I'm getting a $2 million payout there."
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.260]   So that's just an example of how almost anything
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.100]   can be an alternative asset.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.300]   - And where do things, art, farmland,
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.620]   do those fall in one of these buckets also?
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.620]   - Yeah, to this point of almost anything you say
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.500]   is that an alternative?
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.660]   And the answer is gonna be yes.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.840]   Something like farmland,
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.780]   that probably falls into your overall world of real estate.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.020]   And I would analyze those deals
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.060]   the way I'd analyze any other real estate deal.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.660]   That's probably a low risk, low return version
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.500]   of real estate.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.660]   It's pretty predictable yield.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.000]   I'm gonna rent it to a farmer for a few percent a year,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.860]   and it's probably just gonna slowly appreciate.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.420]   This sort of jackpot for farmland real estate
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.580]   is if you happen to be in the path of urban sprawl.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.900]   Like I live here in Dallas,
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.740]   there's a neighborhood north of town called Plano
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.100]   that 20 or 30 years ago was cornfields,
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.540]   and now it's all 10 and 15 story skyscrapers.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.300]   The guy who owned a ranch there did super well.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.160]   But that's kind of what farmland looks like.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.380]   You've got these things as you're saying,
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.300]   like art, like watches,
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.740]   and probably crypto is like this as well,
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.860]   where there's not really an obvious measure
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.760]   of what's the intrinsic value here.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.880]   Is a Picasso worth a dollar
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.600]   or is it worth a hundred million dollars?
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.360]   It's really only worth what somebody will pay for it.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.460]   There's no cashflow stream there.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.300]   So in those,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.960]   I personally have not gone heavily
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.560]   into any of those collectibles.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.000]   Baseball trading cards would be another example of this.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.360]   The ways you can do well there
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.640]   is either you can just look at this as a hobby and say,
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.000]   "Hey, I am really excited
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.980]   "about owning this cool Rolex watch.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.840]   "And I don't really care if I've quote lost money
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.880]   "and can't sell it,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.600]   "because that's something I'm excited about owning."
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.660]   Like my wife's wedding ring.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.740]   I have no idea if that's worth more or less than I paid,
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.580]   but I really don't care.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.720]   We're not looking to sell her wedding ring.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.360]   We just like it to be a wedding ring.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.420]   And art, again,
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.660]   you could pay a few thousand dollars
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.100]   for commissioning a piece of art from a local artist.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.540]   You're probably not gonna make money on that,
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.860]   but the point wasn't as an investment.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.780]   The point was to have it.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.300]   I think if you're looking at it as a pure investment,
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.020]   I would say this is really a case
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.060]   where you have to know what you're doing.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.940]   I think there's the old apocryphal story
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.140]   about the poker player,
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.380]   where if you don't know who the sucker at the table is,
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.860]   it's probably you.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.280]   Then I think that could be very true
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.340]   in collectibles markets or art markets,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.500]   where if you don't know what you're doing
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.460]   and are just sort of buying at the price it's given to you,
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.020]   if you have fun along the way, that's great.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.660]   But I think your odds of making money as a non-expert
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.820]   in something like art are probably pretty low.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.820]   - I imagine anyone listening here,
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.540]   it probably doesn't feel like they're an expert
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.860]   in evaluating art or baseball players
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.220]   or companies to angel invest in.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.460]   So you mentioned at the outset,
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.180]   the reason you set a kind of threshold
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.180]   for long angle members
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.060]   is 'cause they have to meet some requirements.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.220]   Whether that's a qualified customer
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.820]   or in other cases, there's accredited investor,
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.500]   are those things always gonna be the minimum
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.740]   and someone who doesn't meet them,
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.300]   is there any accessible way
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.460]   to partake in a lot of these alternatives?
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.340]   I know that's two questions.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.820]   So maybe we could talk on who's even eligible for this,
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.540]   then we can move into how would you even go about
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.060]   evaluating it or finding it?
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.980]   - Yeah, great question.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.260]   So as you said, two things.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.660]   First, who can, and then second, who should.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.060]   I think in terms of who can,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.860]   it really depends on the asset class.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.580]   As you said, there's sort of accredited investor,
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.740]   which basically means you've got a six-figure income
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.380]   or you have a million dollars.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.740]   Then there's some higher thresholds
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.100]   like qualified client and qualified purchaser.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.980]   Qualified purchaser is actually a very common one.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.820]   That's the highest level.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.580]   That means you have $5 million or more.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.620]   The most interesting ones,
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.820]   you have to be a qualified purchaser and you can't get in
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:20.220]   if you don't have that $5 million of investable assets.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.740]   I think there's also a question of,
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.820]   hey, you shouldn't be putting 10 or 20% of your portfolio
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.900]   into any one of these.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.220]   You wanna diversify across them,
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.700]   the same way you shouldn't put 10 or 20% of your money
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.500]   into a single company's stock.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.820]   You should diversify across stocks.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.660]   Same thing, you should diversify across alternative assets.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.820]   So if you're talking about putting 1% of your portfolio
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.820]   into something, you need to have enough money
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.060]   that 1% is gonna be a meaningful investment.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.660]   If 1% is $100,
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.980]   then no good sponsor is gonna wanna take your money.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.820]   It's not worth your time thinking about it.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.420]   There can be some complex taxes with 1099s
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.540]   and it's not worth the administrative burden.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.260]   So I think typically this range of low seven figures
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.900]   of having a million or 2 million,
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.220]   or certainly if you have 5 million,
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.580]   it's definitely plenty to play.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.260]   But I think that if someone has maybe $100,000,
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.220]   I would probably not yet go into alternatives.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.100]   I think the two exceptions I'd make there,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.980]   one, as I said, crypto is a very accessible alternative.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.300]   You can put in as little money as you want
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.100]   and there's very good information about pricing.
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.380]   I don't know what a Bitcoin is inherently worth,
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.460]   but I have as much information as anybody else does
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.460]   about what it's inherently worth.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.740]   So I think there's nothing wrong with dabbling in that.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.420]   I also think angel investing,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.620]   if you happen to have friends who you know
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.820]   and trust and respect and think that they're very successful,
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.100]   angel investments are often relatively small dollars
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.220]   compared to some of these other ones.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.500]   So you don't need an enormous amount of money
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.260]   to make a bet on your roommate from college
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.780]   if you think he's gonna start a very impressive company.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   But for a lot of the other ones,
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.540]   I think it often needs to get into high six figures,
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.380]   low seven figures before the administrative burden
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.380]   is worth it and before the good sponsors of these funds
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.820]   will be interested in talking with you.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.620]   So having spent a lot of time in venture capital,
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.740]   I'll push back a little and share one stat.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:05.260]   I believe 95% of all the returns in venture capital
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.460]   are derived from the top 3% of funds.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.340]   So I've always been someone who,
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.660]   as much as I've played in this space
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:15.260]   and even professionally invested others' money in startups,
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.860]   I have been very reluctant to angel invest,
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.500]   mostly because I've started companies,
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   they haven't all worked.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.860]   I have friends that I thought were smart
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.940]   and those companies didn't work.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.660]   I feel like it's just a very hard game
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.300]   where you have to be willing to lose all the money.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.900]   The one place where I will consider
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.660]   writing a small check in a person's company
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.580]   is if it's a person I just know really well
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:35.540]   and I believe in.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:39.780]   But I will say I've also had enough reps
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.660]   working at, investing in, and meeting people
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.300]   who start and raise money and build companies
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.420]   that I feel like my barometer for someone who's great
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.020]   is adjusted for what it takes to also build a big company.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.940]   And I think that if you had asked me 15 years ago
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.740]   which of my friends were awesome and I would wanna back,
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.780]   I'm not sure I would have picked the same way I would now.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.260]   So I'm probably the person that sat by the sidelines
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.540]   more often here and I'm sure I have
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.660]   at least a handful of friends who didn't
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:11.460]   and have hundreds of thousands or millions
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.060]   or tens of millions because of it.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.540]   I remember lots of people trying to write
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.820]   early stage checks in Uber
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.980]   and it wasn't even something that crossed my mind
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.540]   and that turned out really well.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.460]   So I'm a little bit more risk averse in that space
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.060]   than maybe you are, but maybe I'm a little jaded
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.460]   from living and breathing it.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.100]   And feeling like my real estate's in the Bay Area
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.060]   tied to tech, my jobs that I've had,
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.740]   my jobs my wife's had are all tied here.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.660]   So I think that's another factor to consider
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.980]   is if you work at a technology company
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.940]   and your spouse works at a technology company
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.420]   and you live in a place where technology's a big part
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.900]   of the neighborhood or the city you're in,
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.060]   thinking about diversifying how you invest
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.220]   a little differently.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.100]   You know, if you're getting paid in Facebook stock
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.660]   and your spouse is getting paid in a startup stock,
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.420]   maybe tech is not the place to invest.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.060]   So I just wanna flag a few of those before
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.980]   and then get your reaction to,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.700]   there are a bunch of platforms online
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.140]   that let you invest in both alternatives as we've discussed,
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.460]   but also things like private REITs and real estate funds
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.020]   that aren't public, wine, that kind of stuff.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.060]   What thoughts do you have there?
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.660]   Because I think many of them have made it
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.980]   almost as accessible as buying crypto
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:20.220]   and not something where you're necessarily going direct
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.220]   to a fund that has a higher threshold.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.540]   I think that's a great question.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.100]   At first, I would reinforce what you said
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.100]   around the angel investing.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.740]   You should only put money into that
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.980]   that you can afford to lose.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.460]   The question is just, if you have a friend
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.540]   who you think is the best thing since sliced bread,
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.060]   you wanna put 5,000 into that
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.340]   and you can afford to lose 5,000, go for it.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.300]   But I would certainly agree,
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.740]   I wouldn't count on that money for retirement.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.940]   Now, to your question around these investment platforms,
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.260]   I think that's a fantastic one.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:47.100]   I'll start with the disclaimer that I do not invest
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.980]   through any of those platforms.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.660]   And I'm both happy to share what I see as the pros and cons
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.860]   and can share how I go about it personally
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.940]   to the degree that may be helpful to some of your guests.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:58.300]   So as you said, there are a huge number
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.860]   of these crowdsourced investing platforms
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.220]   to whether you wanna get into wine, venture capital,
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.740]   farmland, private equity, et cetera.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.580]   There are crowdsourced platforms for you there,
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.780]   fine art, et cetera.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.740]   I won't get into the sort of pros and cons exactly
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.260]   of each specific one and like their fee structure.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.180]   But I would say generically,
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.700]   I think the biggest advantage of this
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.580]   is it does allow you to get access to an asset class
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.900]   without needing to have personal relationships
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:27.940]   with the partners at those firms.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:30.940]   And without being able to write six or seven figure checks,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.580]   often the minimums will be 5,000 or 10,000 or 20,000,
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.940]   not in some cases, five or 10 or 20 million
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.060]   to get into some of the best funds.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.940]   So it definitely gives access and it democratizes that access
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.580]   and brings down the barriers to entry.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.900]   Now, in terms of what I would say are the downsides
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.900]   and the reason I don't do it personally,
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.740]   there's two of them.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.940]   I think the obvious one
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.060]   is that there are extra layers of fees on it.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.820]   And I think there's nothing inherently wrong
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.660]   with those fees.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.300]   They are providing a service, they have real costs.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.100]   I would just caution people to make sure
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.700]   that they truly understand the fees
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.900]   of what they're looking at,
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.820]   because often there'll be an advertised fee of saying,
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.380]   "Okay, we take 0.75% per year of assets under management,"
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.540]   something like that.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.300]   But what they won't necessarily disclose
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.460]   is that there's also certain administrative fees
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.260]   being paid or maybe the asset that went in there,
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.540]   they purchased it on the open market
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.100]   and then marked it up 10% and then sold it into their fund.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.020]   There's certain things like that,
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.860]   which can actually make the fees a lot higher
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.260]   than they first appear to be.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.980]   So you wanna just make sure you really understand
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.700]   the fee structure of those.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.140]   The second thing, and I think potentially
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.260]   the more important disadvantage and reason I don't do it
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.140]   is that there's a selection bias.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.940]   Now, you said earlier that if you look at venture capital,
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.860]   you said something like 90% of the returns
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.060]   are driven by the top 3% of funds.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.820]   That's gonna be true across a lot of these asset classes
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:49.340]   where the top 5%, 10%, 25% of the funds
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:51.940]   are driving all the returns and really skewing the averages.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.900]   And you're gonna have adverse selection almost universally
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.540]   where I would be shocked if you're gonna find Sequoia
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.060]   as a venture capital fund offered on one of these platforms.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.660]   They're not gonna have the very top tier funds there
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.380]   because those guys are much more careful if there's access.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.660]   Again, if you want to get into search funds,
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.500]   the good search funds or probably any search funds
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.340]   are not gonna be on there.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.780]   It's not an asset class that is looking for
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.380]   quote retail investors.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.980]   And I think that selection bias
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.060]   is gonna cause you problems
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.740]   because if you're expecting that venture capital
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.700]   returns 20 or 30% a year,
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.580]   but then you slice off the very best part of that,
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:24.260]   what you're left with, the venture capital
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:27.420]   you can actually get through these crowdsourcing platforms
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.180]   is not gonna have nearly those same returns.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.300]   You won't necessarily lose money
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.020]   and you'll get some exposure to the asset class,
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.180]   but it's not gonna be the same sort of profits there.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.020]   You're seeing the deals that couldn't get funded
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.020]   by the more connected private investors.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.220]   That sounds like a negative story.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.700]   And so I'm not saying this can't be done.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.820]   I'll share the way that I do it
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.540]   is I think basically the most effective way
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.300]   is to do it via networking.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   That was actually part of the reason I started Long Angle
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.340]   is I was interested in getting
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.100]   into a lot of these asset classes,
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.700]   but I didn't have the network.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:53.820]   There's some things I knew well.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.140]   I'd started a software company.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.860]   So I do know other people who are starting
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.780]   software companies.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.180]   I can do that angel investing by myself.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.260]   I maybe even know some VCs and could do the VC investing,
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.100]   but I don't know anything about mineral rights.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.340]   And I don't know guys who are buying acreage
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.100]   in the Permian Basin and that sort of thing.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.540]   I didn't have the right first person connections
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.980]   at private equity funds, search funds, et cetera.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.740]   So the way I do is actually,
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.100]   it's all through the Long Angle network
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.300]   where basically we've got a thousand members every day.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.700]   One of them is sending me a deal,
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.860]   a thousand members with very different
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.780]   professional backgrounds.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.620]   So in every one of these industries.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.580]   So there are people who if you're interested in AI
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.100]   and ML driven crypto trading strategies,
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.500]   there's people who that's part of their whole job.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.020]   They start funds that do that.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.460]   So they're both seeing access to them.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.420]   They send them to me or one of the other guys
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.660]   who's helping manage the community.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.140]   We then pick out the ones we think are most promising.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.820]   And I think in addition to the access,
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.260]   you want the evaluation.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.220]   So we also get a volunteer deal team of three or four people
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.740]   who really know a particular asset class well.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.220]   So for example, we were looking at one
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.020]   that was around tertiary oil field rejuvenation
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.300]   through oxygen injection,
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.220]   and it was fairly technically complex.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.900]   So we just got a team of three or four members
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.860]   who were all petroleum engineers by background.
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.340]   That team did a deep dive on it.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.340]   We ended up passing because we sort of weren't confident
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.660]   with the technology of it.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.860]   The point being that it was both sourced
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.220]   by somebody who worked in that industry
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.900]   and then evaluated by people who work there.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.900]   And so that's how I've done my private market ones
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:17.100]   is that the handful of ones where that deal team likes it.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.300]   And I would say this is only one to two deals a month
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.780]   across a variety of different asset classes.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.220]   We then create a special purpose vehicle or SPV,
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.100]   basically a fund within our group
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.460]   where anyone in the community who's interested in investing,
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.700]   everybody's making their own decisions,
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.340]   but they can read the deal notes and look at the calls
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.980]   and talk with the guy running it.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:35.980]   And if they like that fund,
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   they can then choose to put in a little bit.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.300]   And again, we're able to bring down the sort of minimums
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.700]   because collectively making that investment there.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.100]   So that's how I go about personally.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.700]   Now I realize that only works for me
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.980]   because I'm within the network.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.100]   If somebody joined the community,
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.820]   they could certainly participate there.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.500]   But I think this is also extensible to people
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.940]   who are not in our community.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.900]   We're saying leverage your personal network.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.820]   And I don't think you have to invest
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.860]   in every one of these alternative asset classes.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.420]   I think it would be a lot better for you to say,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.140]   "Hey, there are one or two or three of them
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.300]   where either I have personal expertise
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.780]   or I am good friends with somebody
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.220]   who really has expertise here.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.540]   And I'm gonna leverage that person's connections
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.220]   and that person's expertise."
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.060]   As opposed to saying,
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.820]   "Hey, I just think that watch is a really cool asset class
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.140]   and I don't know anything about watches
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.380]   and I'm not gonna take the time to learn it,
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.980]   but I'm just gonna throw some money at it."
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.900]   You might make money, but you're likely to lose money there.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.220]   So I would focus on fewer asset classes
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.380]   where you really can get that first degree network yourself.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.380]   I totally agree.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.820]   And full disclosure,
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.620]   while I've signed up for many of these platforms
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.460]   and played around,
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:36.740]   the only one I actually use is Masterworks.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.140]   And that's because I like the idea of investing in art
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.740]   with a small part of my portfolio,
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.740]   but certainly didn't have the assets
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.500]   or the expertise to do it myself.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.980]   And I was okay with the fees,
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.180]   especially when I felt like they were doing something
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:51.260]   more than just charging for access to a fund.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.900]   But there weren't a lot of platforms
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.340]   to do anything 10 years ago.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.420]   So I was just kind of learning
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.100]   and I kind of did what you did,
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.180]   which was pick an industry where it was technology
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.220]   and dive into it and understand it deeper
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.660]   and feel like I understood the companies
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:04.420]   and then worked in venture capital.
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.820]   And even with all of that,
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.140]   I'm still pretty hesitant when it comes to angel investing.
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.700]   So it doesn't mean you have to do it,
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.420]   but now I have enough knowledge about that space
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.700]   that people ask me questions.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.020]   And every now and then someone will share a deal
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.780]   or something that makes sense.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.140]   And I've heard the same thing is true with real estate.
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.020]   I've asked lots of people,
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.500]   how do you find all these great real estate deals?
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.260]   Because the number one thing I hear
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.940]   when I ask someone about real estate deals
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.500]   is they seem to always say two things
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.140]   and they're like the most stressful two things
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:31.980]   to be paired with each other.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.980]   One is, gosh, real estate deals are so great.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.780]   I've made so much money on real estate deals.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.220]   And oh, by the way, 90% of all the real estate deals
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.620]   are terrible and you're gonna lose money.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.300]   So I basically decided I have two options.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.980]   I can either really try to understand
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.300]   the real estate community,
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.220]   understand what makes deals good or bad,
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.260]   meet people that can help guide me through that,
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.740]   or I could just steer clear.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.900]   And so for me, real estate has been one
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.220]   where I just haven't been involved,
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.820]   but the opportunity to go to real estate investing meetups
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.620]   and meet people and understand they're out there.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.580]   And I know that if that was one of the asset class
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.060]   I wanted to get into, I could.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.140]   It just hasn't been an exciting passion of mine.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.500]   And so I'm okay missing out on all those deals.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.580]   There are probably a handful of deals
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.580]   that are gonna come up in LongHail
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.860]   that I'm more interested in now than I was before.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.700]   So I'm glad we got to talk about it.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.380]   Yeah, I would agree with you that I wouldn't pressure myself
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.860]   to invest in an asset class 'cause I'm gonna miss out.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.380]   If you put all your money into an S&P 500 index fund,
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.820]   keep it there for 30 years, you're gonna do fine.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.860]   There may be an opportunity to make a little bit more
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.060]   by doing certain well-selected alternatives
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.860]   or mixing them in the portfolio,
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.740]   but I would not do it at the expense of stretching
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.940]   and investing in something where you don't understand it
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.060]   or don't have the access
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.780]   or don't feel like you can really evaluate it.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.460]   And it's funny 'cause in advance of this call,
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.020]   I went and filled out the benchmarking survey
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:41.860]   and I went and looked at mine.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.660]   It's like, even despite my passion in this,
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.020]   even despite all of these deals
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.260]   that come up on the platform, I'm at,
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.860]   I think it was like 88% of everything that I have
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:54.700]   is in equities and my primary residence.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.100]   And of the 12% that's left,
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.380]   it's like half split between cash and alternatives.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.380]   So even for me, it's still something that I try to keep down
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.420]   to the sub 10% part of my portfolio.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.460]   And the vast majority of it,
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.020]   85% of all of that equity is in index funds.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.260]   So for me, as much as this is exciting and interesting
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.180]   and I like to think about it and dabble in it,
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.340]   and maybe that'll grow over time,
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.900]   I just wanna make it clear that my passion and excitement
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.260]   about learning about it is certainly not commensurate
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.380]   to its position in my portfolio.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:27.340]   - So that was like a masterclass on alternatives.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:30.460]   Where can anyone listening that wants to check out
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   more of what you're working on with Long Angle,
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.380]   where can they go?
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.340]   - I'd love to hear from any of your listeners here.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:38.340]   So best place to find about Long Angle
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.060]   is just on our website, longangle.com
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.380]   or feel free to email me directly.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:48.380]   It's T Fallows, T-F-A-L-L-O-W-S at longangle.com
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.500]   if you wanna drop me an email.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.100]   In terms of people joining the community,
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.260]   we do have the qualified client threshold.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.060]   So it would be any of your listeners
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.260]   with 2.2 million or above of investable assets
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.500]   is the threshold for the community there.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.820]   But anybody who wants to join, who's in that demographic,
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.700]   I'd love to have a conversation with you
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.220]   and see if it seems like a fit.
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.220]   - Awesome, thank you so much for joining me.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.340]   - Well, thanks so much for your time, Chris.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:11.140]   I really enjoyed this conversation.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.900]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode,
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.900]   but I wanna let you know that I am totally aware
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.620]   that the vast majority of people listening
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.660]   aren't eligible to join Long Angle,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.340]   but I still hope the conversation was interesting.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.660]   And also by no means is this podcast moving towards a place
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:26.900]   where the topics and guests
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.220]   are only for a high net worth audience.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.100]   Finally, there was actually a little bit more left
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.740]   in this conversation with Tad
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.900]   about how he thinks about money and kids
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:38.180]   from allowances to transparency about family finances
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.740]   and college savings,
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.220]   as well as his top recommendations for his hometown, Dallas.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.980]   So I'll release that as a little bonus episode on Friday.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.100]   And if you wanna get in touch, chris@allthehacks.com,
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:49.940]   I'll see you then.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.340]   (birds chirping)
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:05.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
