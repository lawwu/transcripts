[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.840]   From our perspective, we give them the blank slate to begin with.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.560]   You go through identity, you go through a bank account check, and if you don't pass that, too bad.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.760]   We're not going to be able to take them as a customer.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.260]   I've seen everything from a guy on WhatsApp that you can message and sell gold to that says,
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.060]   "I don't do 1099s, I don't do ID verification," to a reputable person who runs a company,
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.500]   but maybe doesn't have as big of an operation as you, and maybe does do an ID check,
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.060]   but might not do 1099s, all the way to you are trying to do this as by the book as possible.
