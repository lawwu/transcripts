[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.840]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.560]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.680]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.000]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.680]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.360]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.480]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.680]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.680]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.680]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.440]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.020]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.900]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.840]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to say
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.280]   that we are entering into the days of summer.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.360]   I'm assuming that you are as glad as I am
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.820]   to see summertime coming
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.040]   and that maybe you and your children
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.160]   are thinking about things to do together
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.800]   and things to not do for a while.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.660]   I remember when I was little
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.280]   and it was time for school to be out,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.220]   I loved almost nothing better
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.800]   than finding my favorite book and curling up,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.220]   knowing that I could read for hours and hours
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.320]   with nobody to bother me.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.520]   And because we have so many awesome books
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   to offer families and individuals
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.360]   who love to read here at Classical Conversations,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.600]   I wanted to talk to you today
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200]   about our Copper Lodge Library.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.700]   And I have the perfect person
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.040]   to help me introduce you
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.440]   to some of our Copper Lodge Library editions.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   I have with me the lady who worked on
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.000]   the introductions and footnotes
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.800]   to all these Copper Lodge Library editions, Stephanie Meters.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.640]   Stephanie, thanks for joining me today.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.620]   - You're welcome, I'm glad to be here.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.000]   - I know that you love books
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.380]   at least as much as I do and maybe more.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.340]   So I feel like you're the perfect person
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.800]   to talk to us about books.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.420]   And I want to pick your brain
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.680]   and let my listeners, let all of our listeners
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.420]   in on maybe some of the behind the scenes
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.460]   production notes about the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.620]   Everybody likes to know what things are really like
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.780]   behind the scenes.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.720]   So listeners, you get ready for a behind the scenes look
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.680]   at the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.560]   Okay, Stephanie, this is what I want to ask you.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Do you remember the first time you ever went to a library?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.440]   - So I have a lot of early memories of going to the library,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   but I don't think I could possibly remember my first time
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.600]   because I was taken a lot.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   As far as I can remember, I was taken a lot.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.720]   So I don't actually know what my very first time was.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.980]   - Yes, you, okay.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.980]   Stephanie is my older daughter.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.740]   And so I do remember the first time Stephanie ever went
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.620]   to the library and you went,
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.660]   I mean, you were in the baby carrier.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.500]   You went every week because I went every week.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.160]   It was just my habit.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.900]   And the earliest memory I have of you
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.860]   is setting your baby carrier on the big checkout,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.020]   the circulation desk there in our little local library
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.040]   and the librarians would talk to you
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.760]   while I picked out books.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.840]   It was lovely.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.040]   It was lovely.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   But you do have memories of going to the library
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   when you were little.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.520]   I know.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.280]   What did you like about going to the library
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.120]   when you were little?
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.960]   - Man, I liked everything.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.600]   It was a weekly, at least weekly occurrence.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   We would go, us and my little sister would go.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720]   And then when we were homeschooling, another little boy,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.700]   we would all go together.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.960]   We would do story time at the library every week.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.460]   And the librarians were so much fun and would read to us
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.180]   and they got really into the stories.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.640]   And I remembered being treated like an adult in a way
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   when I went to the library.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.960]   The librarians seemed to respect me very much as a person
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.640]   and as a reader and somebody who had her own real opinions
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.480]   about things.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.920]   And I was never made to feel like a child or inferior.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.520]   They very much recognized that love of books
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.040]   is for everybody at any age.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.200]   And so I sort of felt like an equal at the library.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.640]   - Oh, that is so beautiful.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.600]   I love that.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.760]   And I have to say, I have watched you interact
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.640]   with children and books.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   And I feel like maybe you picked that up
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.160]   from the librarians.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.120]   I feel like you treat all of the people equally
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   when you're talking about books, that every person
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   who loves a book is worthy of asking why.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.840]   And they have an opinion and their opinion is not greater
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.320]   or lesser dependent upon their age
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.760]   or even the kinds of books they like to read.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   I like that.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.200]   So do you think that going to the library
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.200]   fostered a love of books and reading in you?
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   What was it?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.240]   What do you think it was that made you love books?
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.760]   - Well, yeah, I don't know if I could say
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   that it was the library 'cause it was just so many things.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.920]   I mean, the library contributed to it,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.400]   but just having stories be a part of our family
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.760]   contributed to it.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.560]   I loved disappearing into books.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.520]   They were a way to experience different places
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.840]   in the world in different time periods.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.840]   Just the power of stories and heroes and villains
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   and helpers and watching characters change.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.920]   As a kid, I loved all of those things.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.800]   And as a person, life takes so much longer than a story.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.400]   And so I think it's interesting to get to see things
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.440]   come more full circle quicker when you're reading books.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.680]   And so it lets you watch people grow
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.000]   and see what's possible to you in a faster format
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.760]   than to watch yourself actually grow up
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.240]   for literally 30 years.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.480]   - Oh, my word, yes.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   And you can see problems resolve and situations resolve.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.440]   And so you can actually see things come to an end,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.960]   like you were saying.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.160]   That's a good insight that I don't know
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.280]   if I had ever really thought about.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   I remember loving, as you say, to disappear into stories.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.560]   And even today, I was sitting here,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.600]   I was reading something else that another CC person
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.960]   had written about reading in the summer
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.480]   and summer book clubs.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   And I was thinking about some of the books that we have
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.480]   in our classical conversations curriculum
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.600]   that I remember reading as a child, as a teenager,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.160]   when I didn't know they were on somebody's curriculum list.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.280]   You know, it was just a book that I loved.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.480]   And I was thinking about the book,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   "The Witch of Blackboard Pond" that I read as,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.160]   I think probably like a sixth or seventh grader one summer.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.200]   And I remember putting myself into the place of Kit.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   And I can remember feeling what it must have felt like
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.600]   to move from a place like Barbados,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.080]   where it was always warm and people seemed friendly
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.800]   and happy, and it was sunny,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   and you swam in the turquoise water.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.240]   And then ending up in Puritan, New England,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.400]   where everything was gray.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.480]   I mean, I just have this very vivid memory
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   that life for Kit was azure and turquoise.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   And then all of a sudden it was steel gray and dull blue.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   And just, it was a very visceral memory
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.800]   that I have of stories.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.160]   And I think that that was an early book
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.680]   that made me think about life
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   from someone else's perspective.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   You know, like what must she have felt like?
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.520]   What would that be like?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.320]   And so, yeah, I think that's something that books can do.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.080]   - You mentioned that you had lots of stories growing up.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.000]   Some people grow up with lots of books in their home.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.640]   And some people with almost no books in their home.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.720]   I remember as a child,
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   when I would go to visit my friends' homes,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.000]   if they didn't have books,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.720]   I just thought that was so weird.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.640]   Like, it'd be sort of like not having toys
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.760]   or not having furniture.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.240]   What do you mean you have no clothes?
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.640]   You know, there are no books.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   So where did you fall?
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.640]   Did you have, I know,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.560]   there were lots of books at our house,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.080]   but did you have books of your very own also?
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.160]   And what did you like about having your very own books?
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.720]   - Yes, so we did have lots of books
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.200]   and I did have books of my own.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.920]   I remember also that a lot of your books
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.280]   that you liked when you were a kid,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.920]   you let me keep in my room.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.880]   And so they weren't mine,
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.760]   but they got to be on my bookshelf
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.480]   because I didn't have very many books
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.360]   that were just mine yet.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.960]   And so I got to grow my own library
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.680]   as I read different things
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.920]   and found books at the library that I liked
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.400]   and I wanted to own,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.520]   or I found an author that I really liked
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   and wanted to buy all of their books
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.920]   that were my very own.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.760]   And just having a shelf to turn to
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.520]   was a way to entertain myself at any time.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.360]   It was a shelf of reference also,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.800]   even if they weren't historical fiction,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.360]   I still think that I would pull out the books
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.320]   because I wanted to find a particular passage
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.920]   or I remember this one character,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.160]   or there were things that I would find in the books
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.720]   that I wanted to reference again,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.480]   either as I was writing or as I was just thinking.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.720]   And stories and books of my own
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.000]   were always a source of inspiration too,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.080]   because books that I loved
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.600]   would make me think of story ideas
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.280]   that I wanted to explore.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.640]   - Hmm, yes, that's great.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.400]   I love that, that you,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.320]   that's really sweet.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.120]   I know that I had some of my childhood books in your room
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.200]   because we would sit in your room and read
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.400]   and so it made sense to keep kids' books in kids' rooms.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.000]   I'm glad to know that it meant so much to you
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.720]   to have books in your room
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.400]   that you could arrange and that you could play with,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.360]   that you could, like you said,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.680]   read again or visit again or reference again.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.440]   I think that's really fun.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.560]   What did you like about choosing books for yourself?
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:43.240]   - There's a lot of empowerment, I think,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.520]   that comes with choosing your own books.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.200]   When you're little, your parents kind of pick books for you,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.960]   not out of control necessarily,
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.800]   just because you're little
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.240]   and you don't know what you might like.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   You don't know what's going to be interesting
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.520]   or what might inspire you.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.960]   So your parents start out,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.720]   but then as you develop your own taste,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.360]   I think of it kind of like developing your own taste in music.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.800]   You develop what you like in books
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.320]   and the kinds of stories that you like to read
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.720]   and they shape you as a person
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.640]   and then maybe you as a person shape the kind of books
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.840]   that you're choosing.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.480]   It's a relationship, I think,
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.880]   and just part of growing up is having books of your own
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.960]   and choosing your own books, choosing what you like.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.760]   And I remember finding some books
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.880]   that I would check out at the library that I didn't like,
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.120]   and that was interesting,
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.560]   figuring out what I just didn't think was very good
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.080]   and then trying to figure out why was it not good?
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.040]   Did you not like the characters?
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.440]   Did it not feel well-written?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.160]   And so that was an interesting exercise as well.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.920]   - Yes, I remember.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.640]   I remember choosing, like you said,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.920]   choosing your books and Sarah's books for her
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.280]   when y'all were little, you know,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   'cause there were favorites that I knew were good
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.160]   that I wanted to see if you liked,
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.800]   and then there were books that I knew were more classic,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.840]   were more well-written.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.240]   I can remember when you started wanting
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.040]   to pick your own books,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.560]   and that was a little bit hard for me,
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.080]   not because I thought you were gonna pick something
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.240]   that would harm you,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.640]   but because I thought,
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.880]   I was afraid that you were gonna be disappointed
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.040]   because some of the books that were enticing
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.080]   to a young girl by their cover,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.440]   I suspected would not be well-written.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.240]   And so I hated for you,
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.200]   I think I never wanted you to be disappointed
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.760]   about the book.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.560]   I just never wanted books to be a disappointment to you.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.080]   And so I think that's why it was hard for me
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.200]   to let you pick a book
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.600]   that I thought might not satisfy you.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.640]   But you know, you have to, as moms and dads,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.760]   we have to let go.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.720]   And I like what you said,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.040]   that in choosing your own books,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.520]   you felt empowered and it was freeing.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.040]   And you did learn that the books you read
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.720]   might shape your taste,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   and then your taste could shape the books you chose.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.840]   So that's really cool.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.400]   I like that.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   Well, today we promised to share with people
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.000]   some behind the scenes info on the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.040]   And so I kind of would like everybody to know
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.000]   where Copper Lodge comes from.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.160]   If you notice,
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.560]   if you guys have Copper Lodge Library books at home,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.040]   you notice on the spine of the book,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.720]   there is, it looks kind of like a castle
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.080]   or kind of like a house,
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.800]   and it's printed in copper.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.640]   And that is the Copper Lodge.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.680]   And maybe you have wondered what's the big deal?
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.280]   What's the deal with that?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.840]   Well, here's the kind of the background.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.080]   As leaders in Seas to Sea thought about ways
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.080]   to help our families build a culture of learning at home,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.400]   as a family, our minds naturally turned to books.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.080]   Most of us grew up loving books and loving to read
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   and finding lots of value in that.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.040]   Lots of us really loved reading
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   with our families as little children.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.400]   And a lot of us found it really sad
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.720]   when we encountered people
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.400]   that didn't have those same memories.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.720]   It seemed especially sad
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   that lots of families did not have a shared memory palace
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.920]   of stories and character quotes and poems
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.760]   that would unite them as a family
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.480]   around common experiences.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.120]   So we began to curate storybooks
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   and our own editions of classic novels and poetry
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.240]   so that people could collect them.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.720]   And have something to read together as a family.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.600]   And when it came time to choose a brand
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.360]   or what we call an imprint of our own,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.400]   we landed on the Copper Lodge
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   because that is what the Bortons family home is nicknamed.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.560]   I don't know if you knew that or not.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.120]   Lee and Robert live in a house
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.080]   that we all call the Copper Lodge.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.320]   It's on a lake.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.000]   There is a lot of copper in the hand railings
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.920]   of the stairs in Lee's house.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.160]   And so Copper Lodge is what we landed on.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.080]   It became a way for Lee to share books
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.600]   and stories that were important to her and her family.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.120]   It was sort of like sharing books
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.320]   from her own library with you guys.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   And so that's how the Copper Lodge was born.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.120]   It was out of a desire to share beloved stories
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.440]   and beloved books and poems with all of you.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.480]   And I do think, Stephanie,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.240]   that some of the dearest memories
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.920]   that our family has are around stories.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.360]   Turns of phrases or pieces of dialogue
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.960]   that characters have or silly poems
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.760]   that we have made together.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.800]   And for me, those are some of my dearest memories
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.240]   about stories.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.000]   - Yeah, I would agree for sure.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.480]   I love, yeah, just thinking about different books
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.800]   that we read together and even kind of extending
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.520]   to movies just with dialogue.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.320]   Yeah, and funny songs and poems
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   and even playing charades based on books that we knew.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   I remember acting out "Anne of Green Gables"
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.520]   with Kathleen, my cousin, who had a green blanket.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.640]   And she was the one doing the charades
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.080]   and she draped the green blanket over her head
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.920]   and started crying.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   And I was like, "Oh, 'Anne of Green Gables,'
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.040]   that's when she dyes her hair green."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   And so just the way that common books can shape
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.960]   a lot of your life outside of just sitting and reading.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   - I know, I love it, I love it.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.400]   And that, having family memories
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.200]   around a common experience of reading
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.440]   is one of the dearest experiences.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.840]   And it is something that your children will take with them
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.960]   when they leave home and it'll be a dear warm spot.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.640]   All right, some more behind the scenes stuff.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.080]   Stephanie, you have worked on many
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.000]   of Copper Lodge Library offerings.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.720]   What was the very first one?
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.640]   Do you remember what was the first Copper Lodge Library book
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.120]   you worked on?
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.000]   - So I think the very first one that I ever worked on
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.600]   was the "American Experience" storybook.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.360]   But I actually don't know if that one
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.640]   or if "Tanglewood Tales" was published for it.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.720]   - Ah-ha, let's see.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.520]   - So they were right there together.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.640]   And the "American Experience" storybook
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.680]   took so much longer to put together
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.640]   because it is a collection of different stories
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.200]   that we hunted down.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   So that's the first one that I worked on.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   But I wanna say maybe the "Tanglewood Tales"
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   that's used in the "Challenge B" exposition strand
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.320]   might be the first one that saw the light of day.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.200]   - You know what?
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.280]   I think you're right.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.760]   I just, I was looking here on my shelf.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   I have both of them right here.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.440]   And here is a cool thing.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.000]   I think probably you did work on "Tanglewood Tales" first,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.320]   but y'all, and I don't know if it's like this
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.400]   with the editions that come out now.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   On my copy of "Tanglewood Tales,"
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.120]   the Copper Lodge is not there.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.640]   It is just CCMM as the imprint.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.080]   But on my "American Experience" book,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.600]   the Copper Lodge imprint is there on the spine.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.200]   So I bet you're right that "Tanglewood" was first,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.400]   but "Copper Lodge" library edition
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.920]   that has the first "Copper Lodge"
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.440]   might very well have been "American Experience."
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.040]   What did you like about working on,
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   you said "American Experience" took a long time.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.400]   What took so long?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.440]   Well, because it is a collection of different stories,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.040]   we had to find all of the stories that we wanted to include.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   So the first thing we did is we tried to decide
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.880]   on a list of characters from American history.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   And so then once we had narrowed down all the characters
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   to the number that we could have,
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.120]   then we had to find stories that were either about them,
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.800]   preferably we actually wanted them
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.960]   to be written by the characters.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.080]   We wanted, our number one goal
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   was to find first person if possible,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.040]   but they also needed to be in the public domain.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.640]   So that mostly meant that they had to be pretty old
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.800]   and we wanted them to be at or below grade level reading
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.960]   because challenge B is not necessarily
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.160]   where we're trying to grow
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.080]   our biggest heart and literature muscles.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.560]   Right, right.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.920]   So yeah, with all of those considerations,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.400]   like narrowing down the characters, finding the stories
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.040]   and then having them preferably be first person
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.000]   below grade level.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.720]   And we wanted them to be positive and uplifting as well.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.800]   So it was just hard to find stories
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.520]   that fit all of those qualifications.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.880]   So it took a little while to assemble.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.520]   Wow, and I guess that you probably,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.840]   you probably rejected a lot of stories too.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.200]   Yeah, some of them were just a little bit too long
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.880]   and it wasn't, there wasn't a good way to excerpt them
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.440]   and have it still be cohesive.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.280]   Gotcha.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.400]   Like I said, this is one of the first things
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.280]   I ever worked on.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   So this was very early in my career as a employee of CCMM.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.040]   And so I wasn't really heavily involved with the choosing.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   I was kind of watching that process for this book
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.720]   and just watching everybody take into consideration
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.320]   different things and weigh options.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.640]   And that was really a fun and helpful experience for me.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.000]   Wow, so it sounds like you learned a lot about,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.880]   well, about publishing,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:21.120]   but about editing and what goes into creating an addition
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.160]   that people might really want to keep
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.640]   in their library forever.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.960]   Yeah, I've learned a lot over this process.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.080]   I think that's really cool.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   So behind the scenes path would be choosing the characters
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.520]   for a book like "American Experience",
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.440]   choosing the characters and then choosing their stories.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.720]   'Cause I suppose you could have picked any number of stories
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.080]   about George Washington.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.880]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.880]   So the stories are designed to be of a readable length
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.000]   for families, but also I really liked that,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.400]   that you chose positive and uplifting stories.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.880]   That's really cool.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.440]   That's really cool.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   So here's a question that I have heard people ask before.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:22.720]   Why is Classical Conversations reprinting books
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.200]   that already exist?
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.240]   Why do we need another edition of "The Secret Garden"
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.080]   or another edition of "Jane Eyre"?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.240]   What is it?
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   I guess what I really mean is what is it
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.040]   that make our Copper Lodge Library editions special?
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.360]   Yeah, so we have created this line
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.760]   with challenge families in mind specifically.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.040]   So just kind of at every turn,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   if we could do something to make the reading experience
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.920]   either more comfortable or more hospitable,
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.840]   we would do that.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.240]   So the books have a good margin size
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.680]   so that students can take notes in the book.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.480]   They don't have to write like between the lines
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.440]   and in little corners.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.800]   There's enough space they can have those conversations
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   with the book.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.240]   And they've got illustrations whenever possible
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.000]   to make them beautiful and give the imagination something
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   to catch onto and just to break up the text a little bit.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   'Cause I know for me as a student,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.120]   if I have to read 10 pages of a book and then I do that
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.160]   and I realize that like one of the pages is an illustration,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.920]   that's like, "Oh, it's a big space."
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.720]   It's like a little breather for the reader
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.680]   as well as being beautiful.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.240]   Yes, that's for sure.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.480]   And then the forewords and the introductions
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.680]   are written to help the students understand
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.600]   some of the themes, some of the historical context
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.520]   and give some reading tips.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.480]   And with the books that have forewords,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.600]   we're getting to hear from different team members of CCMM
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.680]   just what they love about the books.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.520]   The forewords are the invitation to the reader
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   to get them excited about reading this
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.480]   and maybe for the forward writer to share a little bit
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.000]   about how they found the book and what meant the most to them
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.920]   and what their experience was.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.280]   And then we get into that introduction
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   that tells a little bit more
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.240]   of the information side of things.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.920]   So that's the historical context and themes to note.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.240]   And then throughout the book, we have the footnotes.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.400]   So those are for historical context, again,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.840]   to just get in there in those moments
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.800]   where you might not understand something,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   but then also for word pronunciation and definitions.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.280]   - Oh my gosh, that is so good.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.080]   There are words that I had only ever read.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.240]   And the first time, I can remember words like that.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   And the first time I would ever hear them spoken aloud,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.080]   I didn't know what the word was.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.440]   I didn't, like, there were words
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.280]   that was hard for me to connect
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.080]   with print and pronunciation.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.920]   - Yes, yes.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.200]   I think that's the curse of being an early reader.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.760]   You know the words, but you don't know how to say them.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.480]   And so that was something that I was very conscious of
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.000]   when getting to do the annotations for these books
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.200]   is that if I saw a word that I remembered
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.840]   not knowing how to pronounce,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.080]   I would sometimes slip in there
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.480]   and just, let's just put that in there
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.960]   in case anybody else is in that same boat.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.800]   - That is super hospitable.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.720]   Yes, you have probably saved many a challenge student
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.480]   from being embarrassed in college.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.960]   - Well, and sometimes I will double check words
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.320]   that I think I do now know how to say,
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.840]   but if I'm not 100% sure,
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.400]   I'll just look it up on Merriam-Webster.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.600]   And there have been a couple of times
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.920]   that I realized that I was mispronouncing a word.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.560]   - Isn't that most embarrassing?
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.520]   And you try to recreate all the times
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   you might've said it and who might've said that too.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.800]   And were they secretly laughing
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.040]   or did they not know either?
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.240]   So, oh, I love this.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.640]   This is really good.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.840]   So how is it, how do you go about creating the footnotes?
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.560]   'Cause that seems to me to be
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.880]   something that you are excited about,
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.840]   you know, giving that historical context
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   and given pronunciation and giving maybe even definitions
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.200]   of words that maybe are archaic
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.440]   or not, you know, what a typical eighth grader
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.920]   might go around using.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.480]   - Yes, yes.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.320]   So one thing with these public domain readers,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.480]   so we're publishing books that are in the public domain.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.440]   So that means that we can do
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.240]   these kinds of annotations to them.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.560]   Sometimes there are a lot of different
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.760]   public domain sources out there.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.080]   So our lovely coworker, Leslie,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.960]   actually does research to find the ones
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.280]   that will be the most clear, well-respected.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.160]   If there are changes in different editions,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.840]   she'll kind of explore why.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.440]   And then she's the one who does the research
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.480]   to find the public domain illustrations
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.440]   that we get to use as well.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.560]   And during this process,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.320]   sometimes she will find additions of the books
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.120]   that have some footnotes or some introductions
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.920]   or annotations that we can use.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.040]   And so we'll compile that.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.720]   So I usually try to get a pretty solid base
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   of different sources that have some annotations already
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   that I can use as my sort of sources of truth
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.920]   as I'm building this challenge-focused one.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.080]   So once we get that base, thanks to Leslie,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.160]   then I will usually just read the book.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.000]   And if I can't quickly and confidently define a word,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.960]   I will stop and usually footnote it.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.160]   I do try to err on the side
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   of having confidence in the readers
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.720]   because I don't wanna have too many footnotes
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.600]   and I also don't want to ever talk down to students.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.280]   - Yes. - That's a pet peeve of mine.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.480]   So, I mean, if I still can't define a word at 30,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.680]   like having read a lot of these books
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.040]   and doing the footnotes,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.880]   then I will go ahead and say,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.800]   "It's very possible that we might need a note here."
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   So I'll do that.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.360]   And like I said before,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   if I'm confused about a pronunciation
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.400]   or if I'm wondering if I have it right,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.200]   I will look it up and footnote it.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.560]   If there's a proper noun that seems important,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.640]   but I don't get the reference
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.000]   or if there's a quote used in the book,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   like it's quoting another source,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.680]   I'll research that.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.360]   If something contextual confuses me,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.200]   I will research.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.640]   And so these are just the things that I note as I read.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.040]   And if anything gives me pause
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.840]   or I think I'm missing something,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.680]   I'll do some digging and then put a footnote usually.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.600]   - Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.000]   Now, let me ask you this.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.840]   What's the funniest footnote that you ever wrote?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.720]   - Let's see.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.800]   So some of them are a little bit,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.920]   I don't know if I would go so far as to say snarky,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.480]   but some of them are a little bit sarcastic.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.960]   Not overly, but like sometimes those will be funny.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.320]   I know there's one footnote
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   in the "American Experience" storybook
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.600]   that it's a little footnote and it just says, "Wait for it."
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.880]   Because when I read the story, I was very confused
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.800]   because there's something that happens in the story
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.320]   that doesn't make any sense.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.000]   And you wonder if you've missed something
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.120]   and I went back and reread it.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.560]   But no, it's a little bit of a mystery
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.840]   or a funniness in the story
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.760]   that comes out like on the next page.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.120]   And so, because I was so confused and taken aback
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.960]   and thought I was missing something,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.160]   I do have a little footnote in there that says, "Wait for it."
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.200]   So that nobody else has that experience.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.320]   They can know that they can just keep reading
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   and it will make sense in a few words, 100 words.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.720]   - That is so hilarious because I can imagine
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.640]   that there are many Challenge B students
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.200]   who are happy that you put that in there
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.360]   because they were probably thinking, "What in the world?
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.640]   Am I supposed to get this?"
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.080]   So I think that's great.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.560]   I love it that you are still able
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.480]   to channel your inner Challenge B student
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.360]   when you are writing these annotations.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.520]   That is awesome.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.960]   Okay, a moment of true confession.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.280]   Did you read footnotes as a student?
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.600]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.800]   I didn't read the introductions as a student either.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.760]   So it's kind of funny that I'm writing these things
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.480]   that I skipped as a kid.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.680]   And because of that, if students also skip them,
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.560]   I don't know if I should say it,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.640]   but it does not actually offend me.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.400]   I get it. - Yes.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.800]   - But I do think if you get stuck on a word,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.480]   knowing that you can just glance down
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.720]   and not have to go look it up is helpful.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.200]   You don't have to get derailed.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.120]   So students can ignore them as much as they want to,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.880]   but if they get curious or they are confused,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.640]   it's just a little helping hand down there
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.320]   to help them not get derailed.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.560]   - I love that, Stephanie.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.640]   That is so honest.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.240]   Yeah, 'cause I happen to know that that was not your,
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.360]   you did not, and I understand that.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.880]   Like I never wanted to interrupt the flow of the story
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.120]   to go down to get a footnote.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.640]   I just was like sucking in the story.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.840]   It was just like inhaling the story.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.360]   And so I didn't want anything to interrupt me.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.280]   But, and so I appreciate you acknowledging
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.280]   that there may be other readers who do the very same thing,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   but I love your, not exactly an admonishment to us,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.480]   but a reminder that the footnotes are there
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   if we ever get into a pickle.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.960]   That might have to be footnoted right there.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.360]   If we ever get into a pickle and need help
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.960]   figuring something out,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.480]   that the footnote is there to help us.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.680]   Okay, so tell me.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.520]   - One other thing.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.480]   I will say that one of the reasons
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.120]   I hated reading introductions as a kid
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.320]   was that they had spoilers in it.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.480]   So I can tell you that,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.400]   we have some other folks
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.960]   who are gonna be writing introductions for us as well,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.120]   but if it was written by me,
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.560]   it's not gonna have spoilers.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.800]   So you can read your introduction
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.200]   and not be worried about it.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.280]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.600]   I think you should make that a rule
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.480]   that nobody else has a spoiler too.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.360]   Oh, I never thought about that.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.120]   And see, I'm probably telling myself,
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.400]   I frequently skip the introduction
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.160]   or I'll start reading the book
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.920]   before I read the introduction.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.000]   And then a lot of times I do go back.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.560]   - I think sometimes it's helpful
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.600]   to maybe do it in like a sandwich fashion.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.920]   Like you read the book
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.760]   and then you read the introduction
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.320]   before like your second read,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.880]   if you can reread it.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   Because that way you can be sure
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.960]   you don't have any spoilers for yourself.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.720]   And you might know more of what is being spoken about
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   in the introduction.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.800]   You can make the connections.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.760]   And then when you do your second reading,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   having had it unpacked for you
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.480]   and pointed out in the introduction can help more.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.320]   So I don't know.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.760]   I mean, I'm a huge fan of reading books
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   multiple times anyway.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.320]   So I think that's something to consider as a possibility.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.080]   - That is a lovely recommendation.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.520]   I actually like that very much.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.600]   I like that you brought up the whole idea
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   that we can and probably should read books
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.480]   more than one time.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.120]   I mean, if you love them and they're your friend,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.600]   why would you not revisit them?
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.560]   But we get a lot more from our second reading.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.840]   We glean new things.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.800]   I love that idea.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.320]   Okay, so that's what we should all start to do.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.080]   If we don't want to give the time to the introduction
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.360]   on the first read,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.720]   we should sandwich it between the first read
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.120]   and the second read.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.800]   I like that.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.240]   All right, so give me some ideas.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.840]   If I am sitting at home thinking,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.840]   oh, I might like to build our own family library.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.920]   I could start now and I could add a classic every year
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.240]   or multiple ones every year.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.880]   What are some of the Copper Lodge Library classics
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.960]   that are already out?
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.280]   If I want to start building my library now
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.320]   and I trust CC and I think I'm going to start
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.680]   with Copper Lodge books,
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.800]   what's out there for me to choose from?
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   We have a really good spread right now
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.200]   and for a bunch of different ages, too.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.920]   So we have the Uncle Paul readers, which are,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.360]   I mean, they're really fun for every age,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.000]   but they're aimed at scribblers.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.240]   So that's sort of some science.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.920]   We've got insects and natural science.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.320]   And then the story of Rome, which is, as it sounds,
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   the story of Rome in little short stories.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.880]   There's also the Echoes trilogy
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   that Jennifer Courtney curated and worked on,
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.080]   which are fairy tales and old stories
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.480]   that are sort of cultural foundations,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.640]   stories that a lot of cultures have in common
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.080]   or that we hope they'll be able to have in common
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   if we all get these books and read them.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.360]   We've also got the American Experience Storybook
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.480]   and Tanglewood Tales that we've talked about.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.080]   Some Challenge One literature.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.200]   We have Walden or Life in the Woods by Thoreau.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.720]   Some Emerson essays.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.760]   We have the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.680]   and Up from Slavery by Booker T. Washington
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.760]   and The Scarlet Letter.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   And then this year we have The Secret Garden,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.800]   Pride and Prejudice, and English Epic Poetry.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.920]   And I think those are my favorite
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.440]   that I've ever gotten to work on so far,
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.920]   especially English Epic Poetry.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.200]   So I would highly recommend those.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.760]   - What did you like about the English Epic Poetry so much?
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.840]   And give me some samples of what's in there
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.640]   in case we're all sitting here thinking,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.240]   what would an epic English poem be?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.640]   - Right, so we've got the Canterbury Tales,
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.680]   Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.120]   and then Paradise Lost.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.320]   And I think it was, well, it was my favorite,
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.240]   partly because I just love Paradise Lost.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.800]   That was one of my favorite things in college
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   that I got to read.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.360]   And I loved doing the annotations for that
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.240]   because I knew that Milton was brilliant
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.840]   going into this.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.800]   But doing the research for the footnotes
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.600]   made me realize that he was brilliant on a level
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.040]   that I wasn't even aware was happening.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.680]   This man will do like two different allusions
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.120]   in one sentence, not even a sentence, like one line.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.000]   And it also is still moving the poem forward
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.920]   and it has some etymology allusions in it.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.680]   I mean, he just packs so much into so little
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.280]   and it's just brilliant.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.120]   And I hope, I mean, I know the footnotes
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.360]   only scratched the surface of what he was really doing.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.600]   I tried, but I mean, he was way too brilliant.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.360]   So yeah, that's just a super, super fun one, I think.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.040]   Those are all good stories,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.160]   like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.960]   Canterbury Tales, and Paradise Lost
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.000]   are all great stories on their own,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.600]   but just getting a little tiny glimpse
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.040]   into how brilliant it actually is was so fun.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.160]   - You know, that I think would be incredibly helpful
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.720]   to a student.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.480]   It'd be a wonderful thing to have in a personal home library
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.520]   but for a student, it really sounds to me
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.240]   like our Challenge students will benefit so much
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.840]   from having these Copper Lodge Library editions
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.920]   as they're reading it for discussion in community.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.760]   That's awesome.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.640]   You make me want to go read Paradise Lost again,
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.880]   but only if I can have your footnotes while I do it.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.280]   I think I wanna do that.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.160]   Okay, so here's what I wanna ask you.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.080]   There still are Copper Lodge editions coming out, right?
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.920]   We're not done.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.880]   - Oh, yes, we're nowhere near finished.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.920]   More awesome things coming in the future.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.000]   One of my favorite books is eventually gonna come,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.320]   so that'll be great.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.480]   - And we just have to wait to find out what that is.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.360]   - Yes, it's gonna be a surprise.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.280]   - Okay, well, I guess I'll get to have you back
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.320]   to talk about that one when it comes out.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.160]   - Yes.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.200]   - All right, so here's my last question for you, my friend.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   What is your best tip for building a personal library?
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:54.560]   - I mean, just read, read a lot.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.360]   Find out what you like.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.320]   Go to your local library
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.020]   and see what you might want to have for your very own.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.760]   Used bookstores are great as well.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.520]   This is not just one tip, I just keep going,
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.360]   but read widely. - That's okay.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.800]   - Because you never know,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.960]   you might find some genres
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.680]   that you weren't expecting to like that you do.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.560]   - Yes. - So read widely as well.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.280]   I mean, buy Copper Lodge Library.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.160]   We're doing some of the work for you.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.960]   We're picking some books that we think are really good.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.440]   - Yes, that, oh, I love that.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.680]   You can trust us to get a good start
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   on your classic home library.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.660]   I love that.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.440]   I like your tip, read widely, be adventurous.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.120]   You're right, you don't know.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.080]   You might think that you hate poetry,
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.960]   but you might discover that you love it.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   And parents, as you're building a library at home,
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.760]   put lots of different kinds of books in there.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   Not just fairy tales, not just children's poetry,
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.440]   but nonfiction books.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.160]   And biographies, you never know
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.920]   what will catch the imagination of your child
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.000]   or what will catch the imagination of you
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.600]   as you're reading aloud to your child.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.440]   So I love that.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.760]   Be adventurous and try lots of different kinds of books.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.520]   Stephanie, this has been great.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.080]   I have loved picking your brain
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.960]   and finding out what is the process that you use
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.360]   as you guys are building the Copper Lodge Library series.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.120]   I appreciate you sharing.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.280]   It makes me want to go
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.960]   and get my copy of "American Experience"
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.280]   and find the "Wait for it" footnote.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.040]   We found it.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.600]   The Abraham Lincoln story, I believe.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.360]   Okay, oh, thank you for that.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.480]   Okay.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   Okay, extra value added listeners.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.880]   The "Wait for it" footnote
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   is in the Abraham Lincoln story in "American Experience."
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.360]   Thank you, Stephanie, for sharing with us.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.920]   I really appreciate talking to somebody
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.360]   who loves books as much as I do.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.200]   You're welcome.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.720]   Thanks for having me.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.600]   Listeners, I have something else to tell you
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.200]   about Everyday Educator.
