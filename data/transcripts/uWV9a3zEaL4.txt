[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.720]   given to studies of mental health, physical health,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.940]   and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.500]   is for you.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.620]   And now without further ado, I will answer your questions.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.420]   And as always, I will strive to be as thorough as possible,
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.160]   as clear as possible, and as concise as possible.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.880]   The first question is about eye health, in particular,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.120]   eye health protocols for people that are aging,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.760]   but eye health protocols for people in general.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   The question is, I'm noticing that my vision,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.680]   both close and far, is deteriorating.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.920]   What are the best eye exercises, eye health behaviors,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.600]   supplements, et cetera, for the aging eye?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.260]   So the answer I'm about to provide
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.880]   applies to everybody regardless of age,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.200]   which is you want to make sure that you view things
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.760]   both close up and far away across your day.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.060]   Many, many people nowadays spend a lot of time
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.560]   looking at their smartphone,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.600]   looking at the computer screen, looking at books and paper.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.960]   In other words, looking at things
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   somewhere between nine inches away from their face
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.440]   and their eyes,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   maybe two and a half feet away from their face and eyes.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.360]   This is an unprecedented event in human history,
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.680]   as far as we know,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.800]   because it wasn't until the advent of the smartphone
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.820]   that we've spent so much time
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.180]   looking at screens at close range,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.700]   relative to looking at things at further distances
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.320]   from our face throughout the day.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.060]   In fact, it should come as no surprise
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.800]   that the incidence of myopia, of nearsightedness,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.040]   is increasing dramatically around the world,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880]   but is increasing particularly fast in children
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940]   and in young adults and even in adults
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.280]   who are viewing things at very close range,
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.260]   so two and a half feet or less.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.040]   Now, I am not saying that viewing things
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.460]   at two and a half feet or less is bad for your eyes.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.940]   That is simply not the case.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.800]   However, if you want your vision to be maintained
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.920]   or even improve, it's going to be very important
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.980]   for you to view things at a distance as well
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.840]   for ideally several hours per day.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.280]   I realize some people just simply won't accomplish this.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.360]   In fact, I'd like everyone to just take a moment
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   and do a rough estimation in your head
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   of how much time during your daytime activities
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.160]   you are viewing things at say two and a half feet
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.080]   or three feet or less,
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.940]   so a smartphone, computer screen, paper, books, et cetera,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.800]   versus viewing things that are four feet away,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.440]   eight feet away, so maybe conversation across a table
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.060]   with another human being, remember those?
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.220]   Some of us are doing that more now that we seem
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.260]   to be emerging from this whole pandemic phase.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.700]   However, many people are still mostly just viewing things
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.360]   within very close range.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.880]   And in fact, if you were to ask yourself,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.020]   how much time do you spend looking at things
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.000]   at the distance of many hundreds of feet
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.440]   or taking a walk where you're not looking at any screen
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.360]   and you're simply letting visual images
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.480]   or the visual imagery rather pass by on your eyes?
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.680]   I think for most of us,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.120]   that number is getting progressively smaller
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.640]   and smaller with each passing year.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.080]   So this is an issue because the structure of the eye is such
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.400]   that the lens of the eye can move,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.360]   but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.480]   is actually impacted by how close
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.280]   or how far you happen to view things
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   during the course of your day, especially during development.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.520]   There's a classic experiment
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.920]   that I'd like to just briefly describe to you,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.340]   which has been performed in chickens,
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.040]   it's been performed in mice,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.400]   it's also been performed on humans,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   where a visual occluder or a visual image,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.420]   so an occluder is just a black sort of screen
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.800]   or a piece of cardboard or an image,
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.080]   maybe some black and white checks or checkers
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.960]   are placed at a certain distance from the eye,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.280]   either up close or far away.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.380]   And the impact of that on the length of the eyeball
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.020]   and on the structure of the lens
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.120]   and on the quality and acuity of vision
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.200]   is then measured.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.800]   And to make a long story short,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.760]   what these studies show is that if during development,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.320]   you or an animal exclusively looks at things
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.520]   that are up close, very close to the eye
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.320]   and doesn't ever get long range vision,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.180]   the eyeball lengthens and when that happens,
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.220]   the lens, which of course is in the front of the eyeball,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.840]   which focuses the light onto the back of the eyeball,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.920]   which is where the so-called neural retina is,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.940]   where the cells that sense light are,
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.740]   that visual image lands in front of,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.080]   as opposed to directly on the light sensing portion
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   of the eyeball and we call the neural retina.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.880]   It lands too close or near the lens,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.780]   as opposed to on the back of the eyeball.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.620]   And that's part of the reason what we call
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.200]   the consequence of that near-sighted myopia.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.540]   In farsightedness, the opposite happens.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.920]   The visual image is actually focused behind the retina.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.400]   It doesn't land directly on the retina,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.520]   which is what you want.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.760]   It's focused too far behind the retina
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.320]   and that's due to a shortening of the eyeball.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.320]   So what I just described actually explains pretty well
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.120]   why kids who look at computer screens or books up close
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.520]   often need glasses.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.160]   When I was growing up, they called this nerd syndrome,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.760]   raising my hand for those of you that are listening,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.920]   I read an awful lot, but I also spend time outside,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.460]   fortunately, and running around on the soccer field
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.700]   and looking at things in the distance
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.340]   and playing in the neighborhood with my friends.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.780]   Kids that spend the vast amount of their time
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.020]   looking at things up close,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.320]   in particular children who do that indoors
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.580]   for most of their waking time,
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.380]   well, those kids develop myopia.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.320]   This is part of the reason why we have such an increase
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   of the incidence of myopia nowadays.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.340]   What's interesting and I think most people don't realize
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.540]   is that even as a young adult and adult,
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.320]   and perhaps even as an older adult, an elderly person,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.220]   looking at things up close too much
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.420]   at the expense of getting some time viewing things
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.680]   at a distance, in particular outdoors,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.500]   can be very problematic because it can exacerbate myopia.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.900]   So the short direct prescription here is to make sure
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.760]   that you're getting at least an hour or so each day,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.660]   although ideally it would be more of long viewing
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.300]   and that could be done by walking outside
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.800]   and avoiding looking at your phone while walking.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.520]   It doesn't require that you look at a particular object
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.940]   in the distance, although if you are scanning for
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.480]   and looking for objects in the distance,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.780]   the way that you might on a hike
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.660]   or you're looking out toward or off a vista,
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.820]   you're looking for someone in the distance,
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.060]   all of that sort of visual scanning behavior
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.220]   is going to be very good for your eye health
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.660]   and for maintaining vision at a distance.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.540]   If you're somebody who's farsighted
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.620]   and you have trouble seeing things up close,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.220]   well then you need to ask yourself whether or not
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.100]   you're spending too much time
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.460]   looking at things off in the distance.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.860]   Although I want to be very clear that nearsightedness
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.800]   and farsightedness aren't necessarily the consequence
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.040]   of this near far viewing,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.200]   there can be independent causes of nearsightedness
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.360]   and farsightedness, but for many people out there
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.420]   who are spending progressively more and more time
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.020]   just looking at things up close,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.220]   you can get this lengthening of the eyeball
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.780]   or challenges in the way that the elasticity of the lens
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.560]   is controlled by the musculature in ways that make it hard
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.660]   to maintain sharp, crisp vision
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.400]   when you are looking at things at a distance or up close.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.860]   Okay, so I can't because there are simply no studies
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.600]   to support the idea that you need exactly two hours per day
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.740]   of outside long vision at a particular distance
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.400]   and or that you want to cut off or have a threshold
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   of four hours per day of looking at things up close.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.920]   But we can say with a high degree of confidence
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.740]   that if you want to maintain or enhance your vision
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.680]   at all distances, that for every hour or so
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.740]   that you spend looking at things,
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.880]   say a distance of three feet away or less,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.940]   you want to get at least one hour per day total,
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.260]   doesn't have to be all at once,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.100]   of looking at things out in the distance
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.160]   or looking at things beyond three feet
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.720]   relative to the distance from your eye.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.920]   Okay, so I think for some people
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.280]   who are already badly myopic,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.680]   this isn't going to remedy that myopia,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.400]   you're still going to need corrective lenses.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.280]   But if you're somebody similar to the person
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.880]   who asked the question that they're quote unquote,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.600]   noticing their vision is deteriorating,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.980]   really try and balance out the amount of viewing
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.440]   that you're doing at close distance and long distance.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.540]   And again, I would not obsess about the total numbers.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.660]   You know, it doesn't have to be three hours and three hours,
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.820]   but the more time that you can spend at viewing things
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.220]   at variable distance throughout the day,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.300]   the better off you're going to be in maintaining
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.720]   and perhaps even enhancing your vision somewhat.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.500]   Now there's an additional behavioral tool
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.060]   that we can glean from the recent scientific literature
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.700]   exploring myopia, which points to the fact
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.940]   that children who get two hours a day or more
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.580]   of time outside in sunlight, right?
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.700]   One of my favorite topics,
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.900]   I know many people are probably rolling their eyes right now
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.740]   when they hear me say,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.580]   you really want to view morning sunlight,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.740]   not through a window windshield,
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.060]   don't wear sunglasses for that,
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.060]   try and get as much sunlight as you can
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   in your eyes early in the day,
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.260]   never stare at any light so bright,
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.860]   it's a painful lookout, et cetera.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.340]   We've done a lot of episodes on this.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.160]   We have a light for health episode.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.460]   This isn't all the sleep episodes.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.220]   It's just such a basic foundation
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.820]   of circadian rhythm and health that I just keep repeating it.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.880]   However, there are also large scale clinical trials
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.820]   involving thousands of subjects
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.780]   that have shown that people, children in particular,
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.820]   who get two hours or more of outside time every day
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.200]   have a much lower incidence of myopia.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   Now what's really interesting about these studies
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.080]   is that while some of those kids
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.360]   are looking at things further off in the distance
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.860]   than they would if they were indoors on their tablets
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.400]   or screens or with their nose in a book,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.940]   it does not seem to be the case
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.700]   that they have to be looking at things in the distance
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.520]   in order to see this reduced incidence of myopia.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.440]   What's probably happening instead
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.940]   is that the particular wavelengths of light
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.860]   that emanate from the sun,
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.520]   that photon energy in particular
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.040]   is triggering the activation
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.560]   of the so-called intrinsically sensitive
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.980]   melanopsin retinal ganglion cells,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.180]   which we know are important for setting circadian rhythm
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.600]   for enhancing mood focus and alertness during the day
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.420]   and enhancing the quality and duration of sleep at night.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.900]   But those melanopsin intrinsically
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.660]   photosensitive ganglion cells
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.560]   are also involved in networks within the eye
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.940]   that relate to blood flow,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.580]   that relate to the ciliary body,
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.020]   which is a structure within the eye
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.020]   that controls the aperture
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.900]   and movement of some key components within the eye
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.420]   that also relate to the crispness of vision,
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.900]   that is the acuity of vision
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.960]   at both short and long range.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.520]   So there are a lot of technical details there.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.960]   In fact, I really hope to get the great Russ Van Gelder
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.420]   or Dr. Russ Van Gelder,
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.820]   who's the chair of ophthalmology
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.940]   at the University of Washington in Seattle,
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.340]   who is a world expert in this
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.060]   and the various aspects,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.800]   both molecular and structural,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.580]   of the ciliary body and the lens,
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.780]   and he's an expert in uveitis,
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.640]   a very interesting topic in its own right,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.080]   to come onto the podcast and talk more about eye health,
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.300]   and we will do that in the not too distant future.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.220]   Meanwhile, if the first behavioral protocol
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.780]   for enhancing and maintaining eye health
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.540]   is to make sure that you're spending at least some time
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.460]   balancing out the near vision and far vision during the day,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.340]   it also stands to reason that you want to get outside
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.640]   for at least two hours a day,
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.440]   which I know sounds like a lot,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.180]   in order to prevent myopia if you're a young person
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.360]   and offset the progression of,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.880]   and maybe even reverse some myopia.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.260]   We don't know yet based on the data,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.440]   but there's some indication that's possible
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.300]   by getting outside two hours a day.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.660]   And the cool thing is,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.760]   because many people, including myself,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.640]   have a lot of work to do,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.260]   and we need to be on our phones quite a lot,
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.300]   or we choose to be on our phones quite a lot,
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.740]   this effect of getting sunlight outdoors
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.980]   during the daytime for two hours or more
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.360]   does not seem to require that you stay off your phone
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.980]   or tablet or that you're looking at things
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.600]   far in the distance the entire time.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.940]   What this means is if you can get outside onto a patio
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.380]   or a deck or an outdoor table if you can,
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.300]   if weather and conditions permit,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.220]   and do some of your phone time and computer time
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.300]   and reading, et cetera, outdoors.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.220]   Now, if you're already making an effort to get outside,
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.300]   hike, play sports, take walks, et cetera,
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.700]   that of course counts towards this two hour threshold.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.780]   And I know this sounds like a lot, this two hours,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.080]   and yet for most people,
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.180]   certainly will vary depending on time of year,
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.320]   but I think striving to get on average
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.900]   about two hours of outdoor time as much as you can,
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.420]   or opening a window,
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.500]   which wouldn't be as good as getting outside,
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.880]   but opening a window and trying to get
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.340]   some natural light exposure to the eye
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.580]   to trigger the activity of these intrinsically photosensitive
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.260]   melanopsin retinal ganglion cells,
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.660]   that's going to be a really good idea
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.860]   in trying to offset and maybe even reverse some vision loss.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.180]   Now, the other behavioral protocols
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.980]   which have shown to be useful
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.300]   in terms of maintaining or improving vision
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.440]   relate to the musculature around the eye
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.900]   and the control of the movement of the lens,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.060]   and actually the lens of the eye
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.800]   has its own kind of flexibility.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.000]   It's a really, really interesting structure.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.420]   I'll geek out on this far too long
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.640]   if I don't prevent myself from doing so,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.360]   but the lens is just incredible.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.960]   The fact that it has a specific structure of proteins
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.300]   like crystallines and things of that sort,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.300]   and that it can still derive nourishment from blood flow,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.500]   but does not actually have vasculature within it.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.140]   So it's not, if you notice, I mean the lens of your eyes
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.700]   and filled with blood vessels and capillaries
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.780]   'cause it needs light to pass through.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.160]   Super interesting structure.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.860]   I think the only violation of what I just said
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.400]   is the manatee, right?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.080]   Those big sort of underwater elephant-like creatures
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.420]   that I think were or are endangered down in Florida.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.200]   They were getting chopped up by speed boats,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.240]   but I think now there's some effort
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.600]   to preserve those big, gentle giants.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.580]   The manatee, as I recall, has a vascularized lens,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.640]   which is why their eyes look opaque.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.580]   It looks like they have cataracts in any case.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.100]   You're not a manatee.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.960]   You have no blood vessel supply to the lens.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.540]   Keeping that lens clear is vital.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.820]   Nowadays, they can do lens replacement.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.020]   There's really pretty incredible progress
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.900]   in the realm of ophthalmology and surgical replacement
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.100]   of the lens or the cornea, other aspects of the eye.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.700]   But if you're somebody who is interested
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.080]   in maintaining your vision,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.020]   you're going to want to maintain the musculature
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.700]   that controls the movement and the change of shape
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.540]   in that lens and the movement of the eyes,
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.940]   which allows you to transition your vision
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.600]   from very sharp when viewing things up close
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.060]   to very sharp when viewing things at a distance.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.800]   And this is where some of the so-called near-far exercises
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.820]   can be very useful.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.580]   So when we did a full-length podcast on eye health
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.980]   and improving eyesight,
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.780]   which I invite you to listen to if you like,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.520]   talked about two different types of vision exercises
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.500]   that have been shown to be useful for improving vision
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.420]   at the level of acuity that have a lot to do
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.780]   with improving the musculature
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.740]   and the movement of the eyes and the lens.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.740]   And that's what's called a smooth pursuit task.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.320]   So you could go onto YouTube if you like
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.860]   and put smooth pursuit eye task
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.840]   and do this for a few minutes each day
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.780]   if you're trying to keep your vision strong.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.740]   And what that task involves is, as the name suggests,
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.900]   smoothly tracking a small dot or cross hatch
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.420]   or arrow on the screen,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.820]   which is very different than the so-called
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.300]   saccade type eye movements that we often make.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.940]   Saccades are when you dart your eyes
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.760]   to a particular location to look at something,
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.640]   then dart it to another location to look at something.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.940]   Microsaccades are little tiny versions of those
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.260]   that we're doing most all of the time, believe it or not.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.980]   When you look at a visual scene or image,
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.500]   if you did not have those little microsaccades,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.040]   your brain would adapt or would attenuate
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.180]   to whatever you were looking at
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.620]   and the visual image would actually disappear,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.140]   which really speaks to how important it is
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.120]   that your perceptions change in order to maintain them.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.600]   This is very similar to where if something is placed
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.800]   on your hand, say a finger,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.340]   you'll notice that change.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.760]   But then if you leave it there for a short while,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.780]   you'll forget that it's there
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.020]   because the cells there have adapted out.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.860]   There's no change.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.600]   So your nervous system is largely responding to change.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.300]   This is also why when you walk into a room
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.420]   and you often notice a novel smell,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.720]   let's hope it's a good smell,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.100]   after a few minutes or so,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.340]   you don't notice the smell anymore
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.440]   because your olfactory system adapted that away.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.220]   So a lot of that adaptation is prevented
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.820]   by those little microsaccades.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.660]   And the macrosaccades, the bigger saccades,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.300]   are really for moving your eyes around
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.960]   to look for things in visual space.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.380]   Smooth pursuit is a very particular kind of visual behavior
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.540]   that you can do in a smooth pursuit task.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.860]   Again, zero cost, costs a little bit of time, I suppose,
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.700]   to do this on YouTube.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.300]   And most any of them will do.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.980]   We can provide a link in the show note captions
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.300]   of one that we like or several that we like.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.420]   But by doing that smooth pursuit task for a bit each day,
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.900]   maybe just a minute or two,
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.900]   you're maintaining your ability
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.300]   through the musculature of the eye to do smooth pursuit.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.260]   And of course you do smooth pursuit
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.620]   when you move about your day,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.400]   but for people that are trying to offset
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.340]   or reverse vision loss,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.780]   doing some additional deliberate smooth pursuit exercises
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.700]   can be useful.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.480]   The other visual exercise that can be very useful
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.380]   is the so-called near-far exercise.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.320]   So this is best accomplished, I think,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   by holding out a pen or pencil in front of your eyes,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.520]   in front of your head,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.160]   and focusing very intensely
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   through what's called a vergence eye movement,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.060]   where you bring both eyes to the tip of the pen,
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.420]   and then moving that pen closer and closer and closer
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.820]   to your eyes, where you get close enough
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.520]   that you actually have to deliberately bring your eyes,
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.360]   for those of you listening,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.460]   this is what I'm doing right now,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.620]   to the point where it's blurry
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.300]   and you can no longer hold it in sharp, crisp relief.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.060]   You can't see it sharply, that is.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.500]   And then you can move it out a little bit distance
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.260]   and kind of play right around that threshold
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.100]   where it's hard to keep it in focus.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.620]   Now, and then move it back out again and then in.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.260]   Doing that for even a minute or two,
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.660]   you'll find is a bit of a strain on your eyes,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.540]   but you can actually build up the musculature
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.220]   and the neuromuscular connections
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.940]   that allow you to do that more efficiently.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.020]   And that has been shown to improve certain aspects of vision
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.220]   especially when people are diligent
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.860]   about doing those exercises, not necessarily every day,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.340]   but let's say three days a week or so.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.180]   They can be very fast.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.820]   I actually find them kind of fun for reasons
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.880]   that escape me entirely.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.300]   Now, how close you can bring that object
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.300]   and still maintain it in sharp focus
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.020]   will vary from person to person based on a number of things.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.520]   First of all, how healthy and well-performing
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.900]   their neural retina is,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.460]   whether or not they have myopia or hyperopia,
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.780]   nearsightedness, et cetera.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.260]   Whether or not, for instance, you're like me
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.980]   and you have a fairly close interpupillary distance
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.520]   or whether or not you're more wall-eyed
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   and you have your eyes set further apart.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.820]   All those things will dictate the exact performance
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.820]   of that task.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.840]   But nonetheless, it's a very useful task to do
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.220]   when trying to maintain or improve vision.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.160]   Now, of course, there are a lot more behavioral tools
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.520]   that one could use to maintain or enhance vision.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.620]   Really touching on the biggest
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.460]   and what I consider the most important ones
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.840]   that are most accessible to people
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.900]   without the need for any fancy equipment at all.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.920]   And if you want to learn more about other behavioral tools
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.740]   that one can use to maintain or enhance vision,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.780]   please see the episode that we did on eyesight.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.380]   You can simply go to Hubermanlab.com,
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.960]   put into the search function eyesight or vision,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.800]   and it'll take you right to it.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.100]   In fact, everything on that website is keyword indexed
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.300]   and will take you to the various episodes and timestamps
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.720]   that you're interested in according to that keyword.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.080]   Now, the person who asked this question,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.200]   who by the way is Paige Singer, thank you, Paige Singer.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.600]   And the question got a lot of upvotes
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.360]   because apparently there's a lot of interest in this,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.880]   understandably so, asked about nutrition and supplements
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.820]   for maintaining or improving vision.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.600]   That could be a very lengthy conversation,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.880]   but let's just summarize it with a few brief points
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.760]   that we know stand based on the clinical
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.120]   and scientific research.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.900]   We've all heard that carrots are good for your eyes.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.400]   Well, it's not carrots per se that are good for your eyes.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.280]   It's vitamin A that's essential
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.600]   for the so-called phototransduction cascade.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.080]   The phototransduction cascade is the process
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.280]   by which the photoreceptors,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.240]   which are in the back of the retina,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.080]   at least if you're a human,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.800]   they're in the back of the retina,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.440]   take photons, light energy,
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.980]   and convert it into electrical signals
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.320]   that's then conveyed to the other cells
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.800]   and neurons within the retina
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.080]   and then passed into the brain to create visual percepts.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   Most people can get enough of this fat soluble vitamin
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.540]   we call vitamin A by making sure
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.120]   that they eat at least some dark green leafy vegetables
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.800]   and that they do that in their closest to raw form,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.160]   maybe cooked a little bit, but not overly cooked.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.920]   There are other sources of vitamin A out there.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.360]   You can look those up online just for sources of vitamin A.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.660]   Most people will be able to get enough vitamin A
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.580]   from their nutrition and won't require it from a supplement
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.500]   provided that it's not present at excessively high levels
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.620]   in a foundational supplement or vitamin mineral supplement.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.160]   Getting some additional vitamin A from a foundational
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.620]   supplement or vitamin mineral supplement
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.820]   is probably not going to be an issue
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.760]   unless you really take in far too much of that vitamin A
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.720]   and it could potentially provide some insurance.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.920]   But again, I think most people can get enough vitamin A
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.360]   from their diet if they're taking care to eat the foods
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.320]   that contain vitamin A, green leafy vegetables being one.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.200]   The other food that's known to be highly enriched
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.720]   in vitamin A is liver, one of my least favorite foods,
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.020]   regardless of what animal that liver comes from.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.020]   Liver is somewhat of a popular/controversial organ meat
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.960]   in the nutrition space for reasons that aren't interesting
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.760]   for sake of this discussion anyway.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.040]   I suppose for those of you that like liver,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.880]   you could eat a little bit of liver every once in a while.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.960]   It is rich in a number of things
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.040]   that are beneficial to health,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.240]   although for you vegans out there,
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.480]   I'm sure you'll want to avoid liver entirely.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.760]   I avoid liver 'cause I just simply
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.000]   don't like the way it tastes.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   Maybe once or twice I've tasted liver
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.120]   that was appetizing to me and it can be okay,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   but it's just not, or at least by my read,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.540]   it can be okay, but it's not a food
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.180]   that I actively seek out, order,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.760]   or prepare for myself on a regular basis.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.040]   So fortunately there are other sources of vitamin A as well.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.120]   And again, I just invite you to all put into a web search,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.140]   you know, food sources of vitamin A,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.180]   and figure out how to get your daily dose of vitamin A
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.560]   by taking in foods that you like for you.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.660]   And then in terms of supplementation
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.620]   of things that can enhance vision,
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.080]   this is a newer area.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.920]   And frankly, it's an area where most of the data point
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.460]   to some supplements that can potentially be beneficial
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.300]   in certain disease conditions.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.320]   So for instance, in fairly progressed
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.280]   age-related macular degeneration.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.040]   Age-related macular degeneration is fairly common
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.240]   or more common than we would like, we should say.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.440]   And it does appear that supplementing
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.880]   with certain things like lutein,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.280]   which is present in eggs or egg yolks in particular,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.660]   especially egg yolks that aren't overly cooked,
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.680]   or that can be supplemented,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.800]   can potentially help with some instances
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.240]   of age-related macular degeneration.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.800]   But the data on this are still emerging.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.060]   I consulted with our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   about lutein and some of the other things
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.900]   that you'll see out there like zeaxanthine
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.240]   and astaxanthines.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   And you know, these xanthines come from certain fruits
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.500]   like blueberries, and they're present in supplements
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.780]   and things of that sort.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.640]   The consensus I got talking to him
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   and talking to some other ophthalmologists
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.460]   are that if you're really aiming to get a healthy diet,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.860]   you're avoiding cigarette smoking.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.720]   And by healthy diet, I mean getting sufficient amounts
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.140]   of vitamin A and lutein through food sources.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.960]   Again, you can look up where those food sources are.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.560]   Egg yolks just being one of them.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.980]   Well then chances are you're not going to need
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.400]   to supplement with lutein or the zeaxanthines
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.440]   or the astaxanthines.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.600]   However, I have heard anecdotal reports
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.780]   from a number of people that they'll start taking
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.300]   a supplement for eye health.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.780]   There are a number of them out there.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.340]   We are not as a podcast affiliated
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.900]   with any of those eye health supplements, by the way.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.940]   And people are reporting enhanced vision.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.300]   You know, I receive emails all the time that say,
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.380]   you know, I'm taking this, you know,
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.900]   lutein at 20 milligrams per day.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.940]   And there I should mention that the dosage
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.860]   that's been explored in a couple of studies
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.440]   is 10 to 20 milligrams per day.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.860]   Again, you could get that from foods.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.340]   You could go above that if you're, you know,
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.980]   more cavalier or you could go toward the lower end
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.420]   of that 10 to 20 milligrams per day
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.900]   if you are somebody who tries to,
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.760]   who's more conservative, I should say.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.380]   Well, there aren't people out there who are, you know,
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.200]   looking at lutein, they think it's fairly safe
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.860]   and they're taking higher dosages of lutein,
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.420]   so 20, 30 milligrams per day.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.440]   They're also taking supplements that contains zeaxanthines
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.860]   and astaxanthines and are reporting anecdotally
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.460]   that their vision is enhanced.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.580]   I don't dispute those claims, but as of now,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.180]   there aren't many papers.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.340]   I could only find about four, three really solid ones,
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.020]   and then a fourth that point to
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.320]   the specific disease instances where supplementing
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.300]   with lutein, zeaxanthine, or astaxanthine can be beneficial
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.280]   for slowing the progression of things like advanced onset,
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.100]   age-related macular degeneration.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.500]   And the degree of offset for that macular degeneration
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.740]   was slight, it wasn't enormous, but it was robust enough
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.380]   that it warranted reporting in the paper.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.760]   Or things like Liebers, which is a particular eye disease,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.040]   it impacts a whole different set of systems in the eye.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.220]   So basically what I'm trying to say is
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.980]   when it comes to supplements to support eye health,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.740]   make sure you're getting enough vitamin A from your diet.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.460]   If you're not, consider supplementation
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.180]   or consider changing your diet somewhat
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.100]   to make sure you can get that lutein and vitamin A.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.160]   And if you are interested in it and it's within your budget,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.060]   I don't know of any evidence that supplementing
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.960]   with additional lutein, zeaxanthine, and astaxanthine
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.000]   can be dangerous at all.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.360]   So for those of you that are really interested
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.220]   in maintaining or improving your vision,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.360]   that might be an area that you want to explore.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.080]   I personally am not taking lutein, zeaxanthine,
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.840]   or astaxanthine, at least not at this time.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.360]   I do take a foundational supplement,
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.200]   which is my source of vitamin A
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.800]   in addition to my food sources,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.520]   but I don't suffer from vision loss.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.360]   I do wear it at readers at night and I have for a long time.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.600]   I have a little bit of a muscular weakness in one of my eyes
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   that originated in childhood.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.240]   So occasionally if I get very fatigued,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.680]   one of my eyes will deviate a little bit,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.360]   a little bit of almost strabismus,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.640]   especially if I've been awake
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.200]   for very long periods of time.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.840]   It tends to recover once I get a good night's sleep.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.200]   Some of you that have experienced this
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.000]   where you have one eye that might just drift a little bit,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.400]   I could do this for the camera if you want.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.320]   Okay, this is weird.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.520]   I used to do this to my sister across the table
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.960]   when we were at a friend's houses for dinner,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.280]   so I can actually move one of my eyes in like this,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.000]   which actually just reflects that there's a muscle,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.640]   extracurricular muscle, closer to my nose that's rather weak,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.840]   which allows me to kind of do that.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.880]   I can't do it so well with the opposite eye.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.280]   Anyway, now I need to blink to kind of clear my vision.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.360]   But the point is that if you're somebody
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.100]   who has a slightly deviating eye, slightly,
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.920]   often if you go to the ophthalmologist or optometrist,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.300]   they're going to give you a prism lens,
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.440]   which is going to redirect the image
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.100]   onto that slightly deflected eyeball.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.560]   One thing you'll really want to discuss
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.020]   with that ophthalmologist or optometrist
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.620]   is whether or not there are exercises
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.440]   that you could do to overcome that issue
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.700]   without the need for a prism,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.720]   because what I saw and what many other people see
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.380]   when they put on a prism lens is that indeed
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.400]   it can line up their vision
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.280]   or their visual perception better,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.780]   but indeed it can lead to progressive weakening
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.680]   of the muscle further and further
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.360]   so then that eyeball starts to deviate further and further.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.900]   And that raises a larger question,
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.440]   which is should we wear corrective lenses?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.420]   In fact, if you go online,
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.740]   you'll find or hear about these examples of people
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.800]   that stopped wearing their corrective lenses,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.000]   their glasses or contacts,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.360]   in order to bring their vision back
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.160]   or improve their vision on their own.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.640]   Now, if your vision is quite impaired,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.320]   you're going to need corrective lenses or contacts.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.760]   However, there are a number of people out there
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.400]   who find that if their vision is somewhat impaired,
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.180]   that forcing themselves to view things at a distance,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.000]   to do smooth pursuit, to do near far,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.580]   and to make sure that they're getting adequate nutrition
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.820]   and things of that sort,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.900]   can all sum to help offset some of the visual impairment
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.360]   that would occur if they were to just pop glasses
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.040]   on their face and rely on the corrective lenses
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.160]   in order to focus the light onto the correct area
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   within the eye, onto the neural retina.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.560]   So I'm not telling people to throw off
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.860]   or get rid of their corrective lenses and contacts,
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.480]   but you can be overly reliant on these things like a crutch
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.720]   in a way that perhaps you want to do a little bit of work
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.740]   to try and overcome,
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.500]   and then maybe work with a weaker prescription.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.940]   And certainly in the case of prism lenses,
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.100]   what I mentioned before is a real consideration.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.320]   It's one I'm very familiar with.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.620]   So as a last, but I think very important and exciting
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.240]   feature of visual improvement is red light.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.000]   I talked a little bit about this on the episode
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.440]   of the Human and Lab Podcast, all about light and health,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.640]   but there's some really spectacular, I think,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.120]   I consider it spectacular,
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.680]   many other people consider it spectacular,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.840]   research out of University College London.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.320]   And the work I'm referring to is Glenn Jeffrey's work.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.760]   I've known Glenn for a long time.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.580]   These are animal studies and now two human studies
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.580]   exploring how exposure to red light early in the day
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.360]   can offset some of the vision loss
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   related to age-related macular degeneration
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.560]   or simply age-related visual decline.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.700]   And there's a whole mechanism here
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.040]   that's discussed in that episode,
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.360]   but it has to do with the fact that red light
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.640]   and near infrared light together, or maybe even separately,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.080]   when viewed for even just a minute to three minutes once
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.640]   or maybe two or three times per week maximum,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.000]   can actually reduce the number
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.740]   of what are called reactive oxygen species
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.360]   in the photoreceptors that convert photons
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.280]   into electrical signals
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.760]   the rest of the visual system can understand.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.800]   So that's a mouthful.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.460]   Basically what they found was for people 40 years or older,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.300]   if they viewed this red light at a distance
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.520]   of about a foot and a half,
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.800]   although I wouldn't get too specific with this,
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.640]   for a few minutes each week total,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.680]   they were able to offset some of the vision loss
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.500]   within a particular domain of vision.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.960]   And I don't have time to go into the details here,
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.900]   'cause I do that in the light for health episode,
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.360]   but you have different types of photoreceptors,
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.200]   cones and rods.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.040]   You have different types of cone photoreceptors
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.000]   that respond to different wavelengths of light,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.940]   short, medium, and long wavelengths of light,
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.120]   so-called blue, green, and red cones,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.760]   they're sometimes called.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.060]   When these people who are 40 years or older
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.960]   viewed red light on a consistent basis early in the day,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.760]   and it did have to be early in the day,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   there was a real circadian effect there,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.080]   there was a offset of some of the vision loss
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.400]   that would normally occur
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.480]   in a particular wavelength of light range
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.580]   that resulted in better visual acuity overall.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.620]   So if you're very concerned about your vision
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.460]   or you're into red light therapies, et cetera,
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.720]   there are a number of different red light devices out there.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.840]   At some future point,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.360]   the human lab podcast may partner
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.320]   with one of these red light companies.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.360]   So right now, I'm not going to mention any of them.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.960]   In particular, they're prominent online.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.080]   What you're looking for is a red light unit
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.360]   that provides red light
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.080]   and maybe far and near infrared, excuse me, light as well.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   So something in the 650 to 720-ish nanometer range.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.680]   So really, it's going to look red or almost invisible to you
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.600]   if it's really far into the infrared.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.720]   And you'll want to view that at a distance
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   of about a foot and a half to two feet,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.920]   and you don't want it to be so bright
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.160]   that it's painful to look at, okay,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.320]   'cause you don't want to damage your eyes.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.040]   But that's essentially what they used
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.580]   in these studies from the Jeffrey Lab.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.080]   And they showed some pretty impressive offset
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.260]   of some of the aspects of vision loss
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.400]   in these people 40 and older.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.140]   So that's an area that you may want to explore as well,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.320]   especially for folks 40 and older.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.120]   And again, this red light exposure
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.520]   had to be done early in the day.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.640]   So hopefully that collection of behavioral tools,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.680]   near, far, smooth pursuit,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.920]   some of the discussion about lutein, nutrition,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.720]   vitamin A, supplementation, zeaxanthines, astaxanthines,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.320]   getting two hours of light exposure outside,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.760]   sunlight exposure, get outside to do some of your work,
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.520]   and perhaps even deliberate red light exposure
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.740]   for certain people can be used to offset your concerns
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.620]   and your actual potential vision loss,
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.240]   and maybe even improve your vision
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.860]   regardless of what age you are.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.260]   Everything I described is supported
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.020]   from the peer review literature.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.500]   And again, if you want to get the deep dive on mechanism
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.880]   and further information about dosages,
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.560]   please check out the episode on eyesight
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.580]   and improving your eyesight
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.000]   and the light for health episode,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.080]   again, at Hubermanlab.com.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.640]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.580]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.960]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.560]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.820]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.040]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.640]   standard channel and premium tools
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.040]   not released anywhere else,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.200]   please go to Hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.400]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.600]   the Huberman Lab podcast premium channel.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.480]   It's really twofold.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.400]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.880]   for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel,
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.140]   which of course will still be continued
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.600]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   We are not going to change the format
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.600]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab podcast
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.040]   and to fund research,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.080]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.120]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.920]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.120]   that we are most interested in.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.760]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.800]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.700]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.120]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.940]   but through all channels,
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.120]   Huberman Lab podcast and other media channels.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.680]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.880]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.080]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.800]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.820]   in the first place.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.160]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.480]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.400]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.000]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.960]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.040]   to further support research for science
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.800]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.320]   physical health, and performance.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.160]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.920]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.000]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.760]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.080]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.000]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.600]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.960]   that other people ask as well.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.900]   There will also be some premium content
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.720]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.620]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.840]   of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.160]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.520]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.920]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.600]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.480]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.400]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.560]   (upbeat music)
