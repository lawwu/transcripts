[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   - Hello everyone, this is Tony
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.820]   with a special episode for you today.

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   Pastor John calls them bookends and quote,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.380]   "The sum of what I want preachers to know
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.500]   "about the miracle of preaching," end quote.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.100]   And you can get them both from Westminster Books

[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's amazing.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.180]   How is this possible?
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.620]   Well, it's made possible by the incredible generosity
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.980]   of Desiring God's ministry partners.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.660]   And with that, today we have Pastor John
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.020]   reading his brief conclusion to "The Supremacy of God
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.100]   in Preaching."
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.980]   He did not record the full audio book, no,
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.180]   but he did record the conclusion for you,
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.860]   the APJ audience.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.700]   Here he is.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.620]   - The "Supremacy of God in Preaching" conclusion.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.040]   People are starving for the grandeur of God,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.920]   and the vast majority do not know it.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.260]   Those who do say, "Oh God, you are my God.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.340]   Earnestly I seek you.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.420]   My soul thirsts for you.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.920]   My flesh faints for you as in a dry and weary land
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.540]   where there is no water," Psalm 63, 1.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.780]   But most do not discern that they were made to thrill
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.660]   at the panorama of God's power and glory.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.020]   They seek to fill the void in other ways.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140]   And even those who go to church,
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.300]   how many of them can say when they leave,
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.140]   "I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.540]   beholding your power and glory," Psalm 63, 2.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.220]   The glory of God is of infinite worth.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.740]   It is the heart of what the apostles preached,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.000]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.260]   in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.700]   It is the goal of every Christian act.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.660]   Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.440]   1 Corinthians 10, 31.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.640]   It is the focus of all Christian hope.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.100]   We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, Romans 5, 2.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.520]   It will someday replace the sun and moon
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.540]   as the light of life.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.020]   The city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.060]   for the glory of God gives it light,
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.580]   Revelation 21, 23.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.380]   And even now, before that great day,
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.380]   the heavens declare the glory of God, Psalm 19, 1.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.460]   When people discover the worth of God's glory,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.660]   when God says, "Let there be light,"
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.640]   and opens the eyes of the blind,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.740]   they are like people who find a treasure hidden in a field
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.100]   and full of joy,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   sell all that they have to buy that field, Matthew 13, 44.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.920]   They are like Moses who cried to the Lord,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   "Please show me your glory," Exodus 33, 18.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.500]   This is the heart pang of every human being.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.880]   Only a few know it.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.780]   Only a few diagnose the longing beneath every human desire,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.620]   the longing to see God.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.300]   If only people could articulate
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.920]   the silent cry of their hearts,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.980]   would they not say, "One thing have I asked of the Lord
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.740]   and that will I seek after,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740]   to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord," Psalm 27, 4.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.340]   But instead, people in their unrighteousness
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.460]   suppress the truth
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.980]   and do not see fit to acknowledge God.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.820]   And even many who name the God of Israel
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.540]   have changed their glory for that which does not profit,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.080]   Romans 1, 18 and 28, Jeremiah 2, 11.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.140]   Christian preachers more than all others
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.500]   should know this truth,
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.320]   that people are starving for God.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   If anyone in all the world should be able to say,
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.500]   "I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.700]   beholding your power and glory,"
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.800]   it is the herald of God.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   And as we look out over the wasteland of our secular culture,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.060]   must we preachers not ask,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.020]   "Who but us will say to this people, 'Behold your God?'
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.060]   Who will tell the people that God is great
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.780]   and greatly to be praised?
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.180]   Who will paint for them the landscape of God's grandeur?
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.160]   Who will remind them with tales of wonder
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.780]   that God has triumphed over every foe?
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.780]   Who will cry out above every crisis, 'Your God reigns?'
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.820]   Who will labor to find words that can carry
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.020]   the gospel of the glory of the blessed God?"
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.700]   If God is not supreme in our preaching,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.980]   where in this world will people hear
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.860]   about the supremacy of God?
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.400]   If we do not spread a banquet of God's beauty
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.080]   on Sunday morning, will not our people seek in vain
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.140]   to satisfy their inconsolable longing
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.760]   with the cotton candy pleasures of pastimes
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.740]   and religious hype?
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.120]   If the fountain of living water does not flow
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.720]   from the mountain of God's sovereign grace
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.700]   on Sunday morning, will not the people
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.480]   hew for themselves cisterns on Monday,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.760]   broken cisterns that can hold no water?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.140]   Jeremiah 2.13.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.240]   "We are called to be stewards of the mysteries of God."
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.280]   1 Corinthians 4.1.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.720]   "And the great mystery is Christ in you,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.400]   the hope of glory."
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.700]   Colossians 1.27.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.640]   "And that glory is the glory of God.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.920]   And it is required of stewards that they be found faithful,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   faithful in magnifying the supreme glory
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.860]   of the one eternal God, not magnifying like a microscope
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.000]   that makes small things look bigger,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600]   but magnifying like a telescope
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.440]   that makes unimaginably great galaxies of glory
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.160]   visible to the human eye."
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.280]   If we love our people, if we love the other sheep
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   that are not yet gathered into the fold,
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.200]   if we love the fulfillment of God's global purpose,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.400]   we will labor to spread a table in the wilderness.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   Psalm 78.19.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   "People everywhere are starving for the enjoyment of God.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.600]   For as Jonathan Edwards said,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.240]   "The enjoyment of God is the only happiness
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.940]   with which our souls can be satisfied."
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.080]   To go to heaven fully to enjoy God
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.640]   is infinitely better
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.760]   than the most pleasant accommodations here.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.000]   Fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, or children,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.760]   or the company of earthly friends are but shadows,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.200]   but God is the substance.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   These are but scattered beams, but God is the sun.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.080]   These are but streams, but God is the ocean."
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.920]   The ocean.
