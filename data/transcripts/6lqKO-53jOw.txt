[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   My wife and I, every year on the first or maybe the second,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.480]   whenever we get a babysitter, we will go out and spend the half
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.000]   or maybe even a full day doing our couple's goal setting retreat.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Now, in a perfect world, I'd go for two or three days.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.800]   We go to the mountains or whatever.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.320]   And I got little kids at home.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.400]   I got a two year old and six year old.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.480]   So right now that's not happening, but we'll get out for a day
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.920]   and we will work together on where we want to be as a couple.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.200]   And that starts with a reflection on your past.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.440]   Like, where were we last year?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.200]   Where do we struggle?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.160]   What are we doing right?
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.640]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.160]   And then where do we want to be?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   So we do that in our marriage.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   We set goals together every year.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.160]   We visit them every quarter.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.600]   I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.640]   that has our goals for the year, as well as spots for checking off.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.360]   And I'm not very good at checking, honestly, with this.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.680]   I wish I checked it every single day.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.040]   All the habits that are going to give us a better marriage.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.000]   But we at least have it in the mirror every single day
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800]   when I open up my toothbrush.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   Just being intentional, doing the things that we do in business
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.720]   and applying them to our personal life, that has made such a difference on the relationship side.
