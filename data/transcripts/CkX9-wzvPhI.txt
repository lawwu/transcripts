[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.000]   - Podcast listener Roscoe from Tennessee writes,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   "Hi Pastor John, I love the podcast
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.760]   "and enjoy the little tidbits I receive from you
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.520]   "as you proclaim God's word.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.120]   "My question is quite simple.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.460]   "What does the Apostle John imply or mean
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.460]   "when he states in 1 John 2, verses 26 to 27 this?
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.360]   "But you have received the Holy Spirit
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   "and he lives within you,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.200]   "so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.780]   "For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.080]   "and what he teaches is true, it is not a lie.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.420]   "So just as he taught you,
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.200]   "remain in fellowship with Christ."
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.280]   End quote, that's from the New Living Translation.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.040]   What does this mean for average Christians
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.560]   and for our Bible reading?
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.200]   Is this a charge not to listen to teachers?
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.320]   Are we given a new empowerment in our Bible reading?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.120]   P.S. I listen to and appreciate my pastor.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.800]   He's a fine man of God.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   Pastor John, what would you say to Roscoe?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   Okay, let's walk through the text
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.480]   and let the context help us out here.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.440]   Admittedly, it does sound strange
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   to hear John say in 1 John 2, 27,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.640]   "You have no need that anyone should teach you."
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840]   It sounds strange because he himself is at that moment
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280]   doing a kind of teaching.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.440]   And it sounds strange because Jesus commanded us
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040]   to teach the nations all things.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.560]   And it sounds strange because teaching is a spiritual gift
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.840]   from God which he would want us to use and on and on.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   The reasons why it would sound strange are many.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520]   So let's look 'cause we know he's not stupid.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.680]   He knows what he's saying, he means what he means.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.740]   And we wanna dig in here and let the context help us
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.960]   see how this is coherent.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800]   So let's start back at verse 19.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200]   If Roscoe wants to get his Bible,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.600]   this would be a good time to do it.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.640]   And I'm using the ESV because his New Living Translation
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   is a little bit of a paraphrase.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   Start back at 19 and John refers to some folks
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.980]   who had been professing Christians,
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.800]   but somehow had been deceived
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   and made shipwreck of their faith and left the church.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.960]   So verse 19, "They went out from us,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   "but they were not of us.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.780]   "For if they had been of us,
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.380]   "they would have continued with us.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.040]   "But they went out that it might be plain
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.840]   "that they were not of us."
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.000]   And then John contrasts those people
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.360]   with you who are true Christians.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   Verse 20, "But you have been anointed by the Holy One
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   "and you all have knowledge."
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.240]   Or perhaps a better translation, even more radical,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.720]   "You know all things," which is another problem,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   but you don't need a teacher, you know all things.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.320]   Well, all things in what sense, with what limitations?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   In other words, what makes the difference
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.100]   between you and those who have left
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.540]   is that you have the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.320]   You have this anointing in the Holy Spirit
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.520]   and He will not let that happen to you.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.920]   He will grant you to have a right understanding
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   of all things that you need to know to stay safe in Christ.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.280]   There's the contrast that He's drawing
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.780]   between those who left, who were deceived,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.360]   and you now, who are not going to be deceived
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   because you have the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   And then He gives a glimpse of what the false teaching is.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.920]   Verse 22, "Who is the liar?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.080]   "But he who denies that Jesus is the Christ."
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.500]   This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.460]   No one who denies the Son has the Father.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.120]   Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.880]   So the issue is the nature of Christ.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   Who is He?
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   And the false teachers deny that Jesus is the Christ,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.880]   the Messiah, the Christ, the Messiah,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.120]   has not come in the flesh.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.080]   That's what they're teaching.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.160]   He hadn't come in the flesh.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.920]   This idea of a divine Messiah in the flesh,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.880]   the false teachers were rejecting.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280]   And to get this wrong is to go totally wrong.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   Verse 23, "No one who denies the Son has the Father."
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.400]   So that's terrible.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   I mean, that's the ultimate.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.840]   You're lost, you don't have God.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.760]   Then John mentions two safeguards.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.440]   Here we're getting close to the issue.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   Two safeguards that they have against this error.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   And the first is the teaching, teaching,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   that came to them in the beginning
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.440]   of their Christian life.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.640]   Verse 24, "Let what you heard from the beginning
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.480]   abide in you.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.040]   If what you heard from the beginning abides in you,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.900]   then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father."
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.840]   So there's no thought here that the anointing
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.000]   from the Holy Spirit would replace the knowledge of Christ
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.040]   that comes by hearing, teaching.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.720]   You're supposed to keep it, hold onto it, remember it,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.000]   let it abide in you.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   They had been taught once by men.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.160]   That's how they know the Word of God.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.560]   We don't know how extensive their body of knowledge was.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.520]   Might've been remarkably extensive.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.960]   Could've been the whole Old Testament
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.800]   delivered to them in mass in some kind of document
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   that was cherished, or it could have been
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.400]   the whole story of the Gospels and on and on.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.960]   Whatever it was, they had, John says,
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.760]   they had what they needed to be protected
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   against this false teaching.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.040]   And it had come to them through the teaching of men.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.440]   So they don't need someone to replace it,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.520]   add to it, reinterpret it.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.680]   They don't need that.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   They have the deposit of saving truth
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   once for all delivered,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   and they've got what they need to be protected.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.120]   That's what the deceivers are trying to do,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.560]   add to the teachings, change the teachings,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.860]   argue that they got the teachings wrong,
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.380]   somehow get them all mixed up about what they had heard
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.520]   so that they go off the deep end about Jesus.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.040]   And so he adds, verse 26,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   "I write these things to you
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.560]   about those who are trying to deceive you."
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.480]   That's probably the most important contextual comment
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.600]   for understanding why he says, "You don't need teachers.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.720]   I'm writing these things about those
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.460]   who are trying to deceive you."
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.640]   And then comes the second safeguard.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.120]   So the first safeguard was,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.900]   you've left what you've heard from the beginning,
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.040]   the Word of God, the teaching that I delivered to you,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.760]   or somebody delivered to you, guard you.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.000]   And now the second safeguard is, verse 26,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   "The anointing that you have received from him abides in you,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.300]   and you have no need for anyone to teach you,
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.980]   but as his anointing,"
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.820]   this Holy Spirit presence and power,
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.760]   "as his anointing teaches you about everything
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.020]   and is true and no lie,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.260]   just as you were taught, abide in him."
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.220]   In other words, the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.880]   is all you need to avoid this heresy
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.660]   and interpret correctly what was taught you
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.540]   from the beginning about the Messiah.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.660]   The purpose of this anointing is not to add new information
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.720]   to what they had heard from the beginning,
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   but to give them such a clear and true sense of Christ
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.800]   and who he is in that teaching
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.260]   that they cannot be drawn away and swayed by the deceivers.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.880]   So the point of saying
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.480]   that they don't have need of any teachers
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.600]   is that you have what you need.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.520]   One, verse 24,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   "You have what you heard from the beginning.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.400]   Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you."
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.380]   Number two, verse 26,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.560]   "You have the anointing of the Holy Spirit."
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.040]   The anointing that you receive
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.960]   from the beginning abides in you.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   So they don't need, one, false teachers twisting
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.240]   what they heard from the beginning,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.360]   and two, they don't need any more protection
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.060]   from the false teachers than they already have.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.880]   The truth of God's word and the Holy Spirit,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.720]   it really does boil down to that.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.900]   You have the word, you have the spirit.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.720]   What they need is to see that truth for what it is,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.000]   and that's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.040]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, for this clarity,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.560]   and thank you for the question, Roscoe.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.600]   We want your questions, your concise questions,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.800]   and to get those to me,
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.200]   I do read every question, although due to volume,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.520]   we cannot respond to any of the emails,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.120]   but please, thank you for the encouragements.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.840]   I know many of you encourage us.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.600]   When you send those emails along, we thank you.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   We read all of those.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.960]   with John Piper.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.480]   We will see you tomorrow when we talk about
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.140]   how to humbly receive feedback and criticism from others,
