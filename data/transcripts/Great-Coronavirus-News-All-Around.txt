[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.880]   two,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.900]   one.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.000]   I shaved my beard.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.200]   More importantly, or put more accurately, I guess,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.540]   I shaved my quarantine beard.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.080]   And although perhaps you are going to wax nostalgic
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.800]   for the three inches of manly,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.760]   utterly masculine, lumberjackish good looks
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.820]   hanging off of my face,
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.120]   my shaving my beard is vaguely symbolic
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.520]   of the change in my mindset
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   with regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.840]   And I thought that would be interesting to talk through.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   It's been a while since we've talked about the pandemic,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.920]   where I think we are, where I think we're going.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.640]   So let me just share with you a few of my opinions,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520]   and you can consider them for yourselves.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   But I think we are, on a global basis,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.240]   I think we are changing course right now
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.000]   with the COVID pandemic.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.120]   I think that we are,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.320]   it's not the beginning of the end in some way.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.120]   There's still a lot of deaths ahead of us.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.840]   There's still a lot of effects ahead of us, et cetera.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.640]   But I think we're definitely entering the next phase,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   which leads to the end in some way of this pandemic.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   I wanna share with you why I think that
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640]   and what it might mean for the coming weeks,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.480]   months, et cetera.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.440]   There are three major reasons
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.400]   why I think we're entering the next phase.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.580]   The first major reason is at this point in time,
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.880]   we have fairly good data
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   on the effects of the coronavirus disease,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.080]   of the virus itself.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.920]   And that data comes from around the world,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760]   from a variety of reputable sources.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.000]   Because this coronavirus began in China,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.960]   and because that was the source
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.360]   of most of the initial medical data,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   it was very hard to place confidence in that data.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   The Chinese government has a long reputation
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.620]   of concealing data, of flat out lying about the data,
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.660]   manipulating data, and they certainly did the same thing
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.320]   in this pandemic that they have done in previous pandemics.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.780]   And so any kind of data that the Chinese government released
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.400]   was viewed with suspicion, not as automatically wrong,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   but it was viewed with suspicion.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.560]   And in the early days of the virus,
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.760]   there were, the internet was awash
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.640]   with conspiracy theories and videos
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.200]   and people falling on the streets,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.560]   and it was just very, very difficult
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.280]   to get a good information.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.480]   And I think with good reason,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.720]   most observers watched and very thoughtfully
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   and suspiciously looked at the data and said,
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.680]   "This may be true, but we don't know yet."
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280]   And in fact, much of it was manipulated
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.240]   and much of it was also just, it was too early, right?
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.120]   There wasn't enough data collected.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.400]   Then as the virus began to be seen around the world
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.740]   and registered, the data continued to be difficult
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.200]   to come by because there wasn't enough of it.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.080]   But at this point in time, six months in,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.720]   in the Western world, nine months in, on a global basis,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.820]   at this point in time, we've got pretty good data
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.360]   about the coronavirus infection.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   And thankfully, although the sickness is significant
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   for many people, we know that a massive percentage
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.240]   of people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.880]   are non-symptomatic.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.860]   We also know that the case fatality rate
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.280]   and the infection fatality rates are quite low.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.400]   The current best estimates of the infection fatality rate
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   from prominent, leading, reputable medical sources
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.700]   is that the infection fatality rate is probably something
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   between 0.3 and 0.5%, about 0.4%, something like that.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.920]   So fewer than a half a percent of the people
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.840]   who are infected with the virus will end up dying
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.560]   of the virus.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   Now that's on a broad basis, but when you account it
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   for age and for physical condition, we know that it's very,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.040]   the deaths are vastly skewed towards older people
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   with multiple comorbidities.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   So in essence, the virus deeply impacts
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.480]   and heavily impacts people who are old and who are sick,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.880]   but people who are not old and or not sick, not unhealthy,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.040]   have fewer impacts.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   And the dire concerns that many of us had for quite a while
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.480]   don't look to be having the,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.660]   they don't look to be coming true,
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.160]   which is really, really a wonderful blessing.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.080]   In addition, the death rate seems to be continuing to fall.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.040]   Now, why?
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.360]   It's unclear.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.820]   Perhaps the virus is weakening.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.640]   Perhaps it's already gone through
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.360]   the most vulnerable populations.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.720]   We don't know, but it's anticipated
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.760]   that that infection fatality rate number
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.160]   will actually continue to decrease.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.640]   So there's very good reason to be less concerned
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.860]   about the effects of the virus than we once were.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.680]   And I think this is something really worth noting
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.120]   and being very, very grateful for,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   because it could be a lot worse.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.080]   It could have been a lot worse.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.580]   Viral pandemics are very common.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.960]   Every year, there's a viral flu pandemic.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.000]   And so the word pandemic is not in and of itself
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.440]   something that only happens occasionally.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.200]   It happens every year.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.760]   But a really bad viral pandemic is certainly uncommon.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.440]   And so it's nice to know that this one,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.320]   while significant, this one is not,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.000]   it's not the end of the world scenario.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.840]   It's not the thing you write a good dystopian novel about.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.600]   The deaths, the total global deaths,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.900]   when put into context of other maladies,
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.460]   of other causes of death, are overall quite low.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.880]   And so that is very, very encouraging.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.580]   And I think that as that medical data is now seen
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.820]   and now understood, I think more and more people
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.280]   every week are basically saying,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.580]   "I've got to get on with my life.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.820]   "I'm not gonna sit back and be concerned about it."
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.500]   And that's certainly what has changed in my mind.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.800]   I was nervous at the beginning until more data came out
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.580]   about, I don't wanna go out and get sick,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.620]   but I was nervous in the beginning
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.180]   until more data came out to see
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.140]   what is the actual strength of this virus,
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.980]   what actually happened.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.420]   I had friends who got sick and they said,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.180]   "Of course it was significant."
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.980]   But at this point in time, you can't go through your life
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.980]   worrying about a virus that has such a low fatality rate
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   and that has so many people who experience it
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.580]   completely asymptomatically.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.600]   It's just a bad gamble to be worried about that.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.500]   My heart goes out to people who have comorbidities,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.580]   who are older, who are sick, et cetera.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.780]   It's a much harder decision for them.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.580]   But for those of us who are healthy,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.940]   I can't sit around, I'm not gonna sit around
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.860]   and just sit in my house and look for the future
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.260]   and wish for some magical thing to change in the future.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.060]   Now, I would have made that decision about three months ago
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.060]   if I didn't have the luxury of working from home.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.340]   It's a great luxury to be able to work from home.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.820]   And so I've been able to maintain an isolated lifestyle
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.380]   without much difficulty.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.020]   If I couldn't do that with my work situation,
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.880]   I would have come to that decision three months ago
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.720]   because three months ago,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.020]   the data was increasingly pointing in that direction.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.660]   And there are things that are more important
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.380]   than your physical health at times
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.060]   where you simply have to provide for your family.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.140]   You have to do what you need to do.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.840]   And so I think that collectively,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.660]   I see many, many people coming to that same conclusion
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.020]   and I see good, solid evidence
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.540]   as to why that's a justifiable conclusion.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.300]   Number two reason I think that we're coming to that,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.100]   that conclusion would be there are major improvements
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.340]   in treatments for the COVID infection.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.860]   As I sketched out six months ago,
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.540]   when you're looking at a pandemic,
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.380]   what you're looking for is you're looking for an off-ramp.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.220]   And those off-ramps are a few different,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.860]   there are a few off-ramps that you've got to watch for.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.100]   One off-ramp is this is not such a bad disease.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.500]   And although I wouldn't say this is not a bad disease,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.060]   I would say that increasingly it's less bad than feared.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.500]   You know, these words that are subjective,
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.820]   it's hard to know what to say,
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.620]   but it's less bad than previously feared.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.860]   And so that off-ramp is,
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.580]   you can see that off-ramp has come,
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.980]   it is coming, it has come, it will come,
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.420]   that it's not as bad as we previously feared.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.940]   Another major off-ramp to end the pandemic
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.740]   was improvement in therapeutic solutions.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.420]   Does the medical staff, does the medical community
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.960]   have treatments available that are effective?
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.880]   And increasingly the answer is yes,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.380]   as the medical community gets more experienced
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.420]   with the sickness,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.980]   as they get more experienced with treating it,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.140]   then they become increasingly skilled
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.860]   at treating that particular illness.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.740]   And so we see that,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.540]   we see it's one of the reasons why we see
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.140]   a lowering infection fatality rate.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.420]   We see that the medical community
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.560]   is increasingly skilled with treating it.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.660]   Now, there's also even just more and more interesting data.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.020]   First, there's new technologies,
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.540]   there's plasma, blood plasma treatments,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.260]   and innovative things, but even just drug treatments.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.780]   I was fascinated to see,
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.440]   it's been such an interesting debate
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   on the hydroxychloroquine debate,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   because the hydroxychloroquine debate has been crazy
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   in terms of how it has all emerged
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.960]   in terms of a political controversy
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.200]   and people advocating that this treatment,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.480]   that treatment, et cetera.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.400]   But I was interested, last week I was watching,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.000]   I watch, there's a YouTube researcher named Dr. John Campbell
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   that I enjoy getting his input on the medical details.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.640]   He has a YouTube channel,
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.880]   just a guy who turned on a camera
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   who was in the right place at the right time,
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.200]   long time nursing professor,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.160]   was a nurse in the field for many years,
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.560]   and turned on his camera
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   and started giving medical updates,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.440]   which are of course extremely valuable.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.160]   And in his discussions,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.800]   he recently did an analysis of the hydroxychloroquine debate
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   and showed some new research,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.720]   which basically shows significant efficacy
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.560]   for hydroxychloroquine if delivered in the right dosage.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   And the debate seems to be majorly influenced by two things.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.920]   Number one is what goes with the hydroxychloroquine treatment
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.780]   the zinc or azithromycin, whether that accompanies it.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.340]   And then the more important thing, however,
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.540]   seems to be just simply going with low doses.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.760]   And many of the big studies,
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.840]   the WHO study and whatnot,
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.320]   seem to just be doing this mega dosing of hydroxychloroquine
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.740]   far higher than the previous recommendations
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.040]   for the use of the drug.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   And yet that overdosing
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.280]   caused it to be completely ineffective.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.960]   And so when delivered in the proper lower doses,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.320]   then the drug is actually quite effective,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.580]   cutting the death rate by something like 30%
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.560]   for people with the disease.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.040]   And that was one of the other debates,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.640]   is it helpful in the early stages,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.040]   is it helpful in the later stages?
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.440]   This was debated and discussed,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.020]   but the latest reputable research seems to show that yes,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.920]   it's effective for people with the disease
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.280]   and has a significant impact on the death rate,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.920]   which is very encouraging.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.340]   And so things like that are a big, big deal
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.240]   because a drug like hydroxychloroquine,
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.960]   what was always so helpful
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.880]   and so potentially valuable about it
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.800]   is it's an open market drug, there's no patents on it.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.780]   It's very, very cheap.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.880]   And so it can be produced and shared
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.240]   and help to cut the death rate massively around the world
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.440]   if it does continue to prove out to be an effective therapy
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.920]   for people with the disease.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.460]   And so we see that that off-ramp
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.560]   is increasingly appearing very, very significantly.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.600]   Third off-ramp, of course, was vaccines.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.800]   Is there development of vaccine?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.220]   Of course, vaccines are being tried all around the world.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.840]   The results on that are still early,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.700]   but certainly there's a major, major push on all fronts
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.340]   to develop a vaccine.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.960]   And it'll be interesting to watch and see,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.320]   but I don't think it's necessary.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.040]   My personal opinion at this point,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.600]   I don't think it's necessary to stop and wait for a vaccine.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.240]   And so with these developments,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.840]   we see these off-ramps coming where the worst case,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.620]   this is not the worst case scenario.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.240]   This is not the end of the world as we know it virus.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.360]   And these off-ramps are significantly,
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.240]   significantly brightening in terms of this is working
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.680]   and we're getting on top of it,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.280]   which is just great news, great news.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.200]   The final thing I think you see
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   is you see that the economic inability
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.440]   to continue with the lockdowns.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.920]   I have been very, very encouraged to see
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.640]   that the economic effects have been far less
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.760]   than I thought they were.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.440]   I think this is important to factor into our mindset
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.940]   for the future.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.960]   If you were to go back 30 years
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.880]   and go and put this virus on the table
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.320]   the way that it is being experienced now, just 30 years,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.680]   the economic impacts would have been so much harder.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.040]   But our ability to communicate from the palm of our hand,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.160]   our mobile devices, from anywhere in the world
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.960]   has allowed us to genuinely do a good job
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.560]   of keeping productive in many circumstances,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.640]   even through the middle of this pandemic.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.580]   And so the economic impacts, while severe,
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.520]   are less severe than I feared.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.400]   And so it certainly does not look like
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.560]   a worst case scenario.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.940]   It's gonna take a while to work through it all,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.360]   but it's really encouraging to see that.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.960]   And so I'm filled with optimism,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.440]   even just about the moderated economic effects.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.480]   And I see this general clamor that people are realizing,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.920]   like, we've got to stay at work.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.880]   We've got to go back to work.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.600]   My bigger concern's just been,
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.440]   it's been shocking to see how many governments
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.340]   have locked things down medically,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.440]   which has had dire effects on so many people,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.040]   and yet there seems to be no recourse.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.640]   And so I think this is gonna lead to increasing periods
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.440]   of political instability in the coming years,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.760]   people realize how vulnerable they are
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.660]   to authoritarian governments.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.900]   And who knows, right?
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.000]   We'll be debating this for a long time
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.400]   as the data continues to be clarified,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.880]   and we compare and say, well,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.560]   the Australian government is locking people in prison,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.000]   yet this government over here didn't.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.840]   What happened?
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.880]   And it's gonna be a debate for many, many years,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.140]   and we won't know for many years how this pairs out.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.200]   But in my personal perspective,
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.280]   I'm increasingly filled with optimism.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.080]   So I shaved my beard, and basically,
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.480]   to the extent that I'm able,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.360]   I'm getting back to normal life,
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.640]   to the extent that I am able.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   Of course, many of us still live under mask laws and rules,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.880]   and those things are important.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.480]   The next big unknown is gonna be what happens
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.800]   as the Western Hemisphere goes into the wintertime.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.560]   Generally, most people, I think,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.800]   would expect increasing resurgence of the virus
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.600]   as cold weather comes into play.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.920]   That's certainly possible.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.960]   I think there are many reasons for it.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   Maybe the cold weather,
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.560]   the virus becomes more resilient in cold weather, maybe.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.520]   But there are other good reasons,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.320]   just to think less ventilation is a big one.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.560]   If people start to, in the wintertime,
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.080]   they shut their houses down,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.520]   indoor gatherings start to become more prominent,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.280]   people get tired of social distancing,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.320]   more contact.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   We can expect increasing rates of infection.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.600]   We can certainly expect
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   significantly increasing rates of infection
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   as schools open up and as workplaces open up more and more.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.360]   That's totally expected.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.120]   But I think in general,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.760]   probably see that death rate keep low, and we'll see.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.960]   I'm not a medical expert.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.640]   I just try to watch and think it through.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.040]   And so, on the whole,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.920]   even though we'll see as we get into the fall weather
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   in the Western Hemisphere, we'll see what happens,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.960]   but I'm optimistic about the whole thing.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.160]   So, what does that mean for you?
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.760]   I don't know, obviously.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.160]   I'm just sharing what it means for me,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.320]   is that for me, I'm back able to plan.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.720]   I'm trying to plan for the future
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   and get things going and get back into a normal swing.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.440]   I've got a lot of lessons
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.400]   that I've learned from this experience.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.240]   I think more than anything,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   it's how much you value your social contact with people.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.560]   I think we see how important that has been for our lives,
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.440]   for our brains, just for us to function well.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.800]   And the people I'm most concerned about are elderly people.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   I think this virus and the response has wrought a heavy toll
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.840]   that's going to take years to play out
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.480]   among elderly people who are isolated,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.720]   filled with fear many times,
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.600]   and just isolated from social contact.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.640]   It's very, very, very difficult on them.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.520]   But I think that on the whole,
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.640]   I expect things to get better from here.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.520]   I do think the thing that is worth watching,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.720]   I think there's gonna be political instability
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.880]   that's a fallout from this for a while,
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.840]   as there's a reckoning with who happened to be right
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.440]   and who happened to be wrong in the moment.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.560]   And so we'll see.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.960]   But I don't expect that to be a big problem
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.360]   on a broad, globalized perspective.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.720]   Certainly, as the bills come due
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.400]   of massive deficit spending in many governments
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.960]   and major declines in economic productivity,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.360]   major declines in tax revenues, et cetera,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.920]   that's gonna be an interesting and important thing
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.320]   for us to study and watch in the days to come.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   But on the whole, my general feeling at this point
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.480]   is just a sense of optimism.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.960]   I feel like we dodged a bullet.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.200]   We dodged the worst case scenario.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.680]   And I'm really, really happy about that.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.880]   I think that's really, really encouraging.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.480]   And we can be thankful for that.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.360]   Living through this experience,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.400]   when I was younger,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.520]   I used to really want to go through a hurricane.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.480]   There's this boyish enthusiasm for something being crazy,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.240]   and it's a bad event,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   and you really wanna go through a hurricane.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.520]   And I remember the first hurricane I went through,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.240]   and it was so exciting.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.480]   The wind is blowing, the rain is lashing your house,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.440]   everything is howling,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.800]   you're seeing stuff get blown down the street,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   and it was so exciting.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.440]   For a boy who doesn't have property to worry about,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.600]   who doesn't have any concerns about money,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.920]   it's just exciting to go through a hurricane.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.280]   But then, in the wake of the hurricane,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.680]   you look around, and it's just days of misery.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.840]   The electricity's out,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.360]   you got no air conditioning,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.280]   you're cleaning up branches and trees
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.440]   and trying to get your house back,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.560]   and it's hot and it's sticky,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.760]   and you can't sleep, and it's just misery.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.720]   And finally, like,
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.760]   I don't ever wanna go through a hurricane again.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.560]   And I kinda feel like the same thing applies
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.920]   with the global pandemic.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.160]   Now I'm at a point in my maturity
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.720]   where I don't wish for bad things to happen.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.320]   But having thought a lot over the years about bad scenarios,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.840]   you think about pandemics,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   and you think about what could happen in a bad pandemic,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.520]   what has happened, what will probably will happen
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.800]   in the future at some point.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640]   You think, well, maybe,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   well, wouldn't it be interesting to have that happen?
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.000]   And I remember in the early stages of the pandemic
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.280]   back in February,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.680]   when I was really watching and really concerned,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.880]   in March, and in April, I got more concerned.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.440]   And there was this, almost this sense of,
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.160]   I hesitate to use the word
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.040]   'cause it comes with such a bad connotation,
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   but I don't know what other word would work.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.160]   But there's this sense of anticipation.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.760]   There's this sense of, wow, maybe this is it, right?
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.220]   Maybe this is the big one.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.600]   And you look at it,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   and I think, if there were a big one,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   this is what it would look like.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.000]   And it's kind of this really weird mix of dread
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.800]   and anticipation, like, well, maybe this is the big one.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.280]   At least that's what I experienced.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.320]   And so I prepared accordingly,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   and then I watched my experiences through it.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.960]   Number one, I was certainly,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.480]   it became very clear, very quickly,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   like, I really hope this isn't the big one.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.640]   I don't want this to be the big one.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   I really don't wanna go through this right now.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.320]   I had a big year planned.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.520]   It was gonna be awesome.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.280]   I don't wanna go through this.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.120]   But of course, we don't get to choose it.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.920]   The second thing is I learned a lot
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.160]   about just the difficulty of decision-making.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.640]   And I learned a lot about my own normalcy bias.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   I realized how strong my normalcy bias is,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.920]   and how my issues, my personal issues,
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.520]   my personal, the things I struggle with,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.560]   just inability to believe what I saw.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.440]   And I thought, man, if I'm facing this,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.320]   and I've thought about this, I've studied this,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.400]   and I've considered what this happens,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.800]   what would happen, what will happen,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.400]   what could happen, et cetera,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.080]   and I'm just wrestling constantly with normalcy bias,
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.640]   how tough it must be for other people
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.400]   who haven't thought about this in advance as I did.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.120]   And yet still, you're looking at data,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.040]   and you're saying, this is what the data says,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.880]   and yet I can hardly believe that this is what could happen.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.960]   What a powerful thing our normalcy bias really is.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.120]   What a powerful, powerful effect that really is.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.000]   And so that was fascinating.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.520]   The other thing that I just really thought
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   was interesting was how excruciatingly slow this really is,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.000]   how excruciatingly slow a pandemic really is.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.280]   I never imagined how slow an economic catastrophe
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.440]   really can end up being.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.120]   And you read, you watch a movie, a dystopian movie,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.480]   and there's a nuclear explosion,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.240]   or there's something big, and everything happens fast,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.680]   and everything collapses fast for the sake of a good story.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.840]   And authors do this as well.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.760]   Of course, authors have more license,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   but if they stretch it out over chapters,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.080]   and chapters, and chapters, it's too slow,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.000]   and the book falls apart.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.880]   But real life, certainly slow is how it has happened,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.360]   and how it is happening.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.760]   I mean, this is gonna be years in its effect,
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.160]   and here we are nine months into it,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.400]   still talking about how,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   well, I'm not sure what the future's gonna hold.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.960]   That is nine long months.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.880]   And so just the simple boredom with the whole thing,
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.560]   and the slowness of it all, the dreariness of it all
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   has been really remarkable to live through.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.160]   And I've learned a lot of lessons from that.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.960]   I've learned a lot of lessons from that.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.160]   And so to wrap up,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.880]   there are many reasons to continue to be cautious.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.080]   I've been fascinated to see how this is playing out.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.480]   And I don't know if I've gotten some things totally wrong,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.280]   but at the moment it appears like I've gotten
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.600]   some things significantly wrong.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   For example, I'm watching very closely
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.960]   the real estate markets,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.640]   and I expected, about now and over the coming months,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.280]   I still expect this, but I'm wondering if I'm wrong.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.380]   I expected there to be major,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.880]   major decreases in the real estate markets.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.720]   It's just a normal influence,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.800]   a normal effect of a recession,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.680]   that people lose their jobs, they get laid off,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.200]   they start to go behind on their rent,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   they start to get evicted,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.200]   they start to go behind on their mortgages,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.840]   they start to get foreclosed on,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.320]   and real estate prices generally decline.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.240]   Well, what is happening is in many markets
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.000]   is the exact opposite of that.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.240]   Right now in many, many real estate markets,
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.720]   demand is through the roof.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.440]   Many rural markets, you put a property on the market
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.820]   and boom, people are snapping it up.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.200]   South Florida, where I'm from,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.440]   the market has never been hotter.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.520]   And so how much of that is New Yorkers moving out?
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.680]   It has a big, obviously a major influence
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.100]   in commercial real estate in big cities,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.960]   massive plummeting there.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.240]   Residential real estate to some degree affected,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.200]   but very localized, need to look at the local market.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.440]   And so what a fascinating thing.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.520]   I didn't expect that.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.120]   Well, I guess I could have said it was possible,
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.000]   but I guess I didn't expect it to be as strong as it is.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.760]   And so watching this play out is really, really interesting.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.600]   The stock market has been absolutely incredible to watch.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.360]   Massive dumping off, then massive fast rebounding.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.120]   What an amazing thing to see and to watch and to analyze
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.960]   and to consider, really, really remarkable.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.320]   A lot of lessons that are available for us right now.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   So on the whole, I'm studying, I'm learning lessons.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.360]   We're doing well.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.400]   And I am in my mindset, like I said,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   I shaved my beard and I'm a mindset.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.320]   I'm back to trying to actually plan for the future.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.720]   So that's exciting.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.000]   Feels exciting to get off of just pause
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.560]   and be able to get back to planning for the future.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.920]   Travel is opening up, countries are opening up.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.640]   I never thought I would miss an airplane and an airport
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.160]   as much as I have over the last months,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.120]   but I'm excited about where we may go.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.240]   I still think it's gonna take a while,
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.320]   but I'm excited about the prospect
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.360]   of getting back to normal life.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   And I would guess you are too.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   So those are Joshua's thoughts.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.200]   Hope that you enjoy, and I'll be back with you soon.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.480]   - Don't just dream about paradise.
