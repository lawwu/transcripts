[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.140]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.100]   Every week people email us at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.080]   Duncan, I was looking this week
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.280]   and we have 43 pages of questions to go through.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.240]   - Yeah.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.040]   - A lot of details, we don't mind those details sometimes.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.460]   Could use a TLDR sometimes,
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.760]   but we like the fact that people share everything with us.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.120]   So gotta have a good question
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.840]   if you wanna make it to the top of the heap, right?
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.680]   - That's true, yeah.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.980]   - Today's Ask the Compound
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.720]   is sponsored by Foundation Source.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.200]   We get a lot of not to brags
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.740]   in terms of people's net worth, how much money they have.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.880]   We don't talk much about giving back though.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.920]   Foundation Source empowers people and companies
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.740]   to create a better world through philanthropy.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.240]   They're the nation's largest provider
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.760]   of foundation management services,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.880]   trusted source for philanthropic expertise.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.200]   Also have industry leading technology.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.560]   I worked in the foundation space
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.960]   most of my career for nonprofits.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.620]   That is one thing the US does better than any country
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.000]   probably in the world, is we give a lot back.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.040]   And I've worked a lot of nonprofits.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.660]   Foundation Source can actually help you,
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.400]   family offices, CPAs, attorneys, set up a foundation,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.840]   manage it yourself, work through the tax,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.680]   all the tax stuff that goes with it.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.240]   We have a description.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.520]   We'll see the description and a link below.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.320]   Click on that and you can figure out
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.400]   what best describes your goals
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.760]   and how Foundation Source can help.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.720]   Really cool, really cool, cool organization.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.400]   - Yeah, very cool.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.720]   - All right, I am doing today's show live from Montreal.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.480]   I spoke for a banking conference this morning
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.300]   in front of a few hundred bankers.
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.600]   You know, the stereotype of Canadian people is true.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200]   Just some of the warmest, nicest people in the world.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   They really are, you know.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.040]   I come from the Midwest
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.440]   where people are generally pretty nice.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.240]   People in Canada just blow us out of the water.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.660]   I've never been to Montreal before
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.680]   and dunk in my one way of figuring out
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.880]   when I come to a new city, I wanna explore a little bit.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.040]   I walked around and had dinner last night.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.480]   And this morning I went for a jog.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   And anytime I go for a run in a new city,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.560]   it's a way to explore,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.480]   but it's also a nice way to find water
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   and find if there's a good trail.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   And they have a trail right along the water, beautiful,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   just a gorgeous city, really clean too.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   That's what I like about it.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320]   So I double thumbs up for Montreal.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.040]   - Have you heard a lot of people say eh?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.120]   Is that a real thing?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.000]   - Well, people have the French here
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.640]   because we're in Quebec, so it's more French.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.960]   There's a lot of French and yeah,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   it's a very beautiful, beautiful city.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   So let's get into questions for today.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.040]   - Okay, up first today, we have a question from Doug.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.440]   After living through 0% interest rates for years
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.840]   and being a relatively risk-averse 62 year old
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.160]   approaching retirement,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.600]   I was thrilled to see 5% T-bill yields this year.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   I de-risked my portfolio from roughly 75/25 stocks to bonds
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.960]   to more like 60/40 late last year.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.000]   Now the stock market is up double digits this year
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   and I feel like I made a terrible decision.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.320]   Help talk me off the ledge here
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.680]   so I don't regret making an asset allocation change
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   at the wrong time.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.600]   - All right, Doug, I'll talk you off the ledge.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.160]   I don't find much fault in here.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.200]   There were definitely a lot of people
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.960]   when it was 0% interest rates who said,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.360]   "Geez, I should be 60/40, but I'm gonna go 75/25
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.760]   'cause I'm getting nothing from my bonds."
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   And that made sense.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   The two things you could have done back then
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   were make a change to your portfolio allocation
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200]   or just change your expectations.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680]   And I feel like, but this is a good segue
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.240]   into understanding the two reasons
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.080]   that market timing is hard.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.280]   One is, of course, you could be wrong, right?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   You could make a decision, the market goes against you.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.440]   If you go all in and the market falls,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.600]   you feel like an idiot.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.920]   If you go out of the market, the market rises,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.800]   you feel like an idiot, or you could be right.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.680]   Then what, right?
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.360]   Then are you stuck in cash forever?
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.280]   It's hard to get back in?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680]   Like, what is your time to get back in?
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.520]   That's one of the reasons market timing is so hard, but--
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.000]   - That's the title of today's show.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.840]   - That's right.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280]   And we heard from a lot of people
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.560]   that they were really excited about 5% T-bill yields.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.720]   Again, we got so many questions on this
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   and a lot of people asked us what made sense.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.400]   Should I shift some of my equity allocation?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.320]   And I said, you know, that sounds good in a world
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.600]   where the stock market isn't a bear market, we're down 20%.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   When the stock market is up 20%,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.080]   those 5% T-bill yields don't sound quite as good.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.600]   So this is why I wasn't a big fan
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.480]   of making a sweeping change to your portfolio.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.240]   Now, what Doug did here, that's different, right?
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.960]   Doug sounds to me like he took a look at his risk profile
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.640]   and time horizon asset allocation and said,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   now that I'm earning some yield,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.240]   I think I'm gonna go back to where I should have been.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.720]   So that makes sense to me.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.880]   And I think you have to think in terms of process
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.000]   over outcomes when making these kinds of decisions, right?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.440]   What if you make a decision to buy or sell stocks
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.640]   or bonds in your portfolio
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.280]   because of your circumstantial change
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.120]   and not because of the market?
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   'Cause you can never time these things perfectly, right?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.280]   As long as you went from 75 to 25 to 60, 40
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.360]   for the right reasons, that's fine,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.320]   but you can't go 75, 25, 60, 40, 75, 25, 60, 40.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.280]   Oh no, I did something wrong again.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.120]   That's the problem.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.960]   If you're going back and forth,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.400]   if you're gonna stick there because your risk profile,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.480]   time horizon or circumstances or goals changed,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   that to me is not timing the market.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.600]   That's just timing your own life.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.880]   That makes sense to me.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.320]   I mean, the one way you could do it
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   to maybe ease a little of the pain and the regret
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.200]   is slowly do it instead of doing it all at once.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.040]   But then you could still be wrong there because, well,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.120]   I look back and I dollar cost average out of the market,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.440]   but now what if I would've just done it on one lump sum?
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.280]   I would've been better.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.360]   So it's always making these high probability decisions
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.280]   when understanding that you can and will be wrong.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.040]   Sometimes the market just goes against you.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.880]   It's not very much fun.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.160]   So I think everyone is wrong at some point.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.440]   When investing, I think the best you can do
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.400]   is just plan for a wide range of outcomes.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   That's why I think it's so important
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.240]   to give every asset class or strategy in your portfolio
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.820]   a job in the first place.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.120]   So when you have some cash come in,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.400]   you don't have to think about it.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.960]   You just know, okay, I'm putting cash
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.240]   based on this asset allocation
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   and I'm putting it in there now
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   and I'm not thinking about it.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   So you don't have to get,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.160]   you have a cash for some reason, a bonus,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.120]   or you sold something and you sold a house
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   or whatever, you have money.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.080]   You're not thinking, jeez, should I,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.360]   what's the best investment opportunity?
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.200]   T-bills or bonds or stocks.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.920]   If you have a plan in place already,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   you don't even have to think about it.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   You just do it.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.720]   That's the whole reason you have a plan in the first place.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   - Yeah, I made a note here,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.880]   but it kind of reminds me exactly what you're talking about.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.360]   It reminds me of driving on snow or ice
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.100]   and how where you really get into trouble is snap steering
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.720]   and trying to like over-correct.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   That's what causes wrecks and crashes.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.680]   - The very first time I drove in snow,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.920]   I had a 1989 Honda Accord.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.240]   Tires were basically bald,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.320]   which was great for driving on Northern Michigan.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.620]   And I didn't have anti-lock brakes.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.520]   They didn't exist on that car yet.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.120]   And the first time we had a light dusting,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.320]   I slammed the brakes and went right into a ditch.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.960]   Very first time.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.320]   I was like a block from home.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.920]   - You're basically an F1 driver if you don't have,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.760]   if you don't have anti-lock brakes.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.700]   - Yeah, I'm, yeah.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.720]   All right, next question.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.280]   So yeah, Doug, I don't think you market time.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.000]   I think you made the decision
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   with all the information at the time that you had.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.280]   I'm sure you're kicking yourself off.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   I would've just waited a little longer,
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.920]   but the reason you set an asset allocation
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.360]   in the first place is because you want to stick with it.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.440]   - Yeah, good advice.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.220]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Chris.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.560]   Does rebalancing essentially lock in losses?
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.120]   I have a robo-advised Roth IRA
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.760]   that seemingly rebalances every other day.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   Will I ever get back to break even?
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.580]   And when do I stop buying the stock market on sale?
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.200]   - Rebalancing is actually supposed to be
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.760]   more of a value type of strategy.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.640]   It's like counter-cyclical approach to investing.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.760]   So it's a process of trimming some of your winners
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.260]   to buy some of your losers, right?
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.080]   That's the whole idea.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.160]   So let's look at an example
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.040]   to see how rebalancing works in practice.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.000]   So let's say you took 60% of your money
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.520]   and you put it in stocks in the US stock market,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560]   40% of your money in 10-year treasuries.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.480]   So if we go back,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.200]   if we look over the longterm, the past 95 years,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   1928 to 2022, S&P 500 did 9.6% per year.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.560]   10-year treasuries did 4.6%, right?
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.400]   So if we simply took 60% of the stock market return
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.000]   and 40% of the bond market return,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.800]   we get 7.5% per year roughly, right?
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.120]   Not bad.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.920]   But what if we take the actual returns on an annual basis,
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.760]   not just the average,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.640]   and we rebalance back to 60/40 once a year?
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.960]   Now our annualized return is more like 8.2%.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.600]   So how did we get 70 basis points more of return
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.400]   than what you would expect just based on the averages?
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.720]   Well, it's the rebalancing bonus, right?
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.480]   So over the past 95 years,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.400]   the stock markets outperformed the bond market 60 times
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.240]   on calendar year basis,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.840]   meaning the bond market is outperforming
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.200]   the stock market 35 times.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.720]   So those years when stocks are doing better than bonds,
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.560]   you're trimming your gains,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.440]   which doesn't feel that good
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.920]   if the stock market keeps going up,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.240]   but if it goes down, you're doing great, right?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.920]   And those years when bonds do better than stocks,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.400]   you're redeploying some of that dry powder
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.600]   from bonds into stocks.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.120]   So it's not a perfect strategy by any means,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.960]   but I think it's a way to keep yourself honest
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.280]   and stick with that asset allocation as I talked about.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.240]   Is daily rebalancing an overkill or every other day?
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.880]   That does seem a lot to me.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.480]   And it might not be bad for your portfolio,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   but it might not be good.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.720]   So Vanguard actually looked at the data
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.800]   in a research piece last year.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.640]   John, do a chart on for me.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.040]   Also, I just have to say, keep the chart on.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.800]   I was giving my talk today and I have a chart on sticker
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.640]   that we have.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   I don't know if we sell that one anymore, Duncan,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.760]   but we have a chart on sticker.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.600]   We never did, it's a one of a kind.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   And someone, I can't believe it,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.080]   they were unfamiliar with my work,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.400]   and they said, "Are you a technical analyst?"
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.680]   Because I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.120]   They said, "We have a chart on sticker on your..."
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.360]   - And you just said, "Yes, yes I am."
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.160]   - Yeah, good enough.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.600]   So anyway, Vanguard actually looked
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.100]   at a global 60/40 portfolio and found too frequent
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.680]   or too infrequent is not a good idea.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   So you can see from this chart,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.400]   it says daily is actually the worst.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.880]   Annual is optimal, but then if you never rebalance
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.080]   or wait two and a half years to rebalance,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.320]   then you start losing some positive benefits
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.660]   from rebalancing.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.920]   So daily probably is a little too much
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.400]   because you want to have some drift in your portfolio
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.840]   to allow the assets that are doing well
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.580]   to continue working at least for a time.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.640]   So I think once every six, 12, maybe 18 months at the most,
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.500]   it seems reasonable to me.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.200]   I guess you could also do some sort of threshold
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   where I have a 10% allocation to this asset class,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.600]   but if it goes 20% above or below that, I could rebalance.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.040]   Or you could have periodic, I'm gonna rebalance annually,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   but if I breach those thresholds in the meantime,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.480]   then I'm gonna rebalance.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.400]   That all makes sense to me.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.840]   My view on this is it's horseshoes or hand grenades, right?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.000]   Close enough does the trick.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.600]   Now onto the question about locking in the losses.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.040]   I like the idea behind rebalancing
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.640]   to sell some of your winners, buy some of your losers,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.440]   especially when stocks are down, right?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.000]   And so if you're still making contributions
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.140]   and your portfolio is not fully funded,
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.640]   you want to keep buying stocks on sale.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.020]   So I think as long as you're doing that,
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.080]   you don't want stocks recovering.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.600]   The stock market has recovered quite a bit.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   It's still down.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.900]   I think the S&P is down 10% from all-time highs
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.440]   after being down 20% at one point.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.520]   But if you're still making contributions,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.960]   yeah, you're not locking in losses.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.120]   You're just, you're continuing to buy stocks.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   That, you know, I mean, if you're an individual stock, sure.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.160]   Are some of them never gonna go back?
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.040]   Probably.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.400]   But if you're in an index,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.560]   can I guarantee they'll come back?
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.600]   No, but I can be pretty certain
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.680]   that losses are probably gonna be temporary
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.560]   and that buying into losses,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   especially if you're a younger person,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.920]   you're still making contributions, is a good thing.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.760]   Be thrilled to be buying stocks on sale.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.780]   - Wait, so you're saying my individual stocks
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.640]   aren't all gonna reach their previous highs necessarily?
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.080]   - I mean, I,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.920]   yes. - Holding out.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.320]   - Probably not. - Holding out hope.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.000]   - I, yes, the probabilities are not with you, unfortunately.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.740]   - Okay, well, that's depressing.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.760]   - You know, they say hope is not a strategy in investing,
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.320]   but I think we're all have a little bit of element of hope,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.880]   but you keep buying and hoping, Duncan.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.780]   - Yeah, yeah, I will.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.840]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   Up next, we have a question from Bill,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   a question from Bill for another Bill,
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.440]   which is kind of cool.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   So, "If Bill's suite is going to be on,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.840]   "please ask if he knows of a way
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.260]   "to move some of my assets into my son's names
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.060]   "without tax consequences.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.760]   "I already fully fund Roth accounts
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.820]   "for each of them and their wives."
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.920]   Wow, this is a really nice dad.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.020]   - Yeah, it is, nice parent here.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.880]   We get questions addressed directly to Bill now,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.440]   probably as many as are coming directed to me.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.240]   So let's bring the Roth man on the show.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.200]   Bill, we have a question for you coming in hot
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.160]   because you're now getting questions asked to you.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.000]   Someone asked on our team this morning,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.320]   "How many Ask the Compound shows has Bill appeared on?"
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.160]   What do you think?
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.600]   The numbers surprise me.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.320]   - Wow, that's a-- - Drop numbers in the chat.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   I'm curious to see guesses.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.480]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.560]   So do you want me to answer,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.880]   or are we pulling the audience here?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880]   What are we doing?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.840]   - Yeah, let's pull the audience
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.040]   and we'll answer after this question.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.880]   - Okay, I have a guess.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   I'll write it down.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.360]   What's crazy, too, not to interrupt,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.520]   but there's two Bills, too.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.120]   You've had multiple Bills on the show.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.440]   So this Bill specified Bill's suite out of all the Bills.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.280]   - It's true. - So I'll take it.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.480]   Thank you.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.800]   So this person wants to,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.160]   they don't wanna go around the U.S. government,
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.000]   the IRS, obviously,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.760]   but they wanna figure out how do I leave more money
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.200]   to my heirs before I pass, I guess.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.440]   What are the gifting consequences here
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.520]   from a tax perspective?
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   - Right, so this is, Ben,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.280]   this is a great not to brag question
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.140]   'cause it's kind of subtle and embedded.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.360]   I'm gonna assume that Bill
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.140]   isn't talking about income tax here
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.400]   because, Ben, as you know,
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   and Duncan, I'm sure you know, too,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.160]   there's no income tax consequence for transferring assets.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.680]   As a matter of fact, the cost basis tends to transfer
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.840]   and therefore the tax consequences are the heirs.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.120]   Ben, if you're gonna give away
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.320]   your $179 Apple stock to your kids
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.440]   that you bought for a dollar,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.680]   the income tax is the kid's problem, not yours, right?
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.260]   So I'm assuming they're talking about gift tax,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.500]   which is a totally separate tax regime
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.680]   than income tax entirely.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.920]   We've all kind of heard of it, right?
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.100]   If you're conservative, death tax.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.240]   If not, it's this sort of tax on millionaires.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.640]   And ultimately, the gift tax would only kick in
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.880]   if you're gifting more than $17,000 of assets
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.960]   to any single person in any single year.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.160]   Bill sounds like a great dad,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.140]   so I'm assuming he's talking about limits ahead of this.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.300]   Bill, if you happen to be married,
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.280]   your gift limit if you split gifts with your spouse
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.080]   is actually $34,000.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.320]   - Oh, it's one per person, okay.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.280]   - Per person, correct.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.080]   And Ben, and Bill mentioned in his email
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   that he's been sort of helping his sons
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.120]   and their daughters out with forming a case,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.000]   his daughter's-in-law.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   So ultimately, if it's couple to couple,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.280]   that's all the way at $68,000 per couple per year, right?
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.120]   So you get to stack these-
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960]   - Oh, so that's a pretty high threshold then.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.600]   - Pretty high threshold, no gift tax consequences at all.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   However, it sounds like Bill's trying to think ahead.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.960]   He's maybe thinking about some estate planning.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.720]   If you give anybody in excess of that,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.840]   you need a file form 709, and that's a gift tax return.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.160]   But for the most part, you probably don't need tax.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.200]   Ben, do you have any idea why you would no tax
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.640]   if you're above the exclusion amount?
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.660]   - No, I'm trying to figure out the gift tax stuff here.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.500]   I'm lost, what do you got?
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.320]   - Okay, cool.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.480]   Okay, everyone, you, me, Duncan, John,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   everybody listening on this call today
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.800]   is a $12.92 million lifetime gift and estate exclusion
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.880]   at the federal level.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.440]   And so that means there's no gift tax
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.800]   until you've exhausted that entire limit.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.480]   And that limit does adjust for inflation.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.040]   It does change over time.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.480]   Famously in 2010, the year George Steinbrenner died,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.320]   the gift exemption was unlimited.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.840]   Like there was no gift tax at all.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   So it does kind of move around a bit.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.560]   But ultimately, if we're talking about amounts below that,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.760]   there's not gonna be any gift tax consequences either.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.440]   You just kind of need to do some estate planning.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   And this would really-
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.720]   If Bill has a big amount of money,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.440]   talking to an advisor or estate planner
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.280]   is probably not a bad idea.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.520]   - And that's when you hire an attorney.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.640]   And if you're above that 12 million,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.160]   13 million individual, $26 million for a couple situation,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.120]   again, God bless you, that's a real serious, not to brag.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.960]   That's the type of client you would-
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.780]   - Or start a foundation.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.880]   I have one other suggestion for Bill here.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.800]   Spend some of that money with your kids now.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.280]   Don't just give it all to them.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.920]   Spend some money, take them on a trip,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.600]   maybe an extravagant dinner, instead of leaving it all.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.400]   Like experience, they're gonna appreciate those experiences
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.680]   and memories way more than they are gonna,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.520]   getting a lump sum of the day you buy.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.920]   - And start a family business together with that money.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.880]   - I love it, I dig it.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   Yeah, Ben Duncan, I was gonna go into a Gratz,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.960]   grant a retained annuity trust.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.760]   I was gonna go into family, into partnerships.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.140]   But Ben, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.960]   That experience you have with your children,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.080]   you can't replicate that.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.120]   Young parent here, I'm with you.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.640]   You stole my thunder, man.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.480]   Good job.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.280]   - All right, next question.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.960]   I think we have another one addressed to Bill.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.320]   - Let's reveal the number of times that Bill's been-
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.880]   - Oh yeah, how many times has Bill been on the show?
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.720]   What do you got?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.640]   - I'm gonna guess 15, 15.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.520]   Coming in high.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.360]   - What was it?
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.200]   - 21?
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.720]   - 21 today, today is the 21st.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.600]   - Wow, I can legally buy beer today.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.440]   That's awesome.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.840]   Congratulations, guys.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.120]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   - Yeah, we'll give you something.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.920]   Maybe we'll send you a sticker in the mail, Bill.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.840]   - Great, great show.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.120]   It's my favorite part of my whole week.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.600]   When you guys bring me out of the box.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   - Let's do another one.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.900]   I can get another one addressed right to Bill.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.960]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.440]   - Here we go.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   Okay, up next we have a question from Nicole.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.480]   Not our Nicole though.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.160]   I got excited earlier this year
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.200]   when Bill spoke about the new tax change,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.520]   especially the benefit of 100% contribution to a Roth 401k.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.260]   It made me wonder, what will next year's filing look like
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.720]   after increasing my income?
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.960]   They got a pay raise, congrats.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.640]   And they're doing 100% Roth contribution
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.600]   with no current tax break.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.120]   I'm taking advantage of a Roth
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.840]   as I see the benefit of being taxed on my income now.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.380]   However, I'm a little nervous about my 2023 tax burden.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.760]   - All right, a lot going on here.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.800]   Yeah, good little not to brag,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.760]   but I think a lot of people probably in this
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.000]   because inflation has been so high.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.320]   People are getting raises now, right?
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   Labor market is tight.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.240]   So what's the big worry here, Bill,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.160]   in terms of the pay raise?
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.520]   Just 'cause this seems like we get this question
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.080]   all the time of I'm close to that Roth limit.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.960]   I don't know what it's gonna look like.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.660]   What's the worry here?
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.800]   - Yeah, so the worry is that Nicole's gonna
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.560]   make more income good for Nicole.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.160]   Ben, keep in mind, the tax brackets
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.560]   are adjusting for inflation too.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.000]   So ultimately, if you're just getting
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.120]   an inflation-adjusted raise,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   hopefully you're just keeping pace.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.880]   But the fear is the more that you sort of
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.320]   deposit into that Roth bucket, vice traditional,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.720]   the higher your income tax is in the present, right?
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.240]   And we all know I'm pro-Roth.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.440]   I mean, Sean and Dave in the chat were like,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.600]   "Hey, should I just ever go 100% Roth?"
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.120]   I think maybe my Roth stance
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.820]   has been a little too overstated.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   I do love Roth.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.320]   I think Roths are underutilized,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.160]   but 100% Roth--
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.320]   - Are you saying you never go full Roth?
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.360]   - You never go full Roth.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.680]   That's exactly what I'm trying to say.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   You beat me to the punch.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.480]   And so I wanna quote a couple of things
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.200]   from an academic paper, Edward Ricquari.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.760]   Great, great, great academic paper.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   I shared it there in the chat if you wanna check it out.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.680]   But two quick quotes from when and for whom
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.600]   are Roth conversions most beneficial.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.240]   Quote number one, "In temporal,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.420]   "tax arbitrage proceeds inch by inch.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.300]   "It's a slow process that takes decades to ripen.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.360]   "And furthermore, Roth conversion always pays off
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.000]   "if the time span is long enough."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.640]   Unfortunately, Ben, on a long enough timeline,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.520]   we're all dead, right?
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.880]   So like, really, you get to add 10 years after your passing.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.280]   And I think that kind of nails it.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.000]   So what Nicole is getting at is do I wanna pay tax now?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.280]   So John, can we pull up a chart
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.040]   and maybe take a look at this?
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.080]   So instead of thinking it like Roth, Roth, Roth,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.160]   we want Roth everywhere,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.280]   what I'm showing the listeners on the YouTube channel
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   is the 2013 marginal tax rates.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.840]   And here you can just see,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.160]   if you visualize it, close your eyes,
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.760]   you can see a stair step up.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.360]   And it goes from 10% to 12% to 22%.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.880]   That's the first very big jump.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.800]   And if you look directly in the middle of the chart,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.960]   the 24 to 32% jump is the next big jump.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.440]   And the two big jumps happen
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   at roughly about $58,000 of gross income
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.400]   and about $195,000.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.280]   So Nicole, if you're around there,
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.560]   instead of thinking all Roth or no Roth,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.480]   for me, if you're contributing below that 22% bracket,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.840]   it probably makes sense,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.240]   assuming that you have 30 years of competing ahead of you.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.520]   John, can we flip to the next chart, please?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   To break this into three chunks,
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.140]   my opinion is you wanna Roth that piece
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.600]   if you're in the 10 or 12% tax bracket, right?
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.320]   So again, a single individual of $58,000 or less.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.520]   There's this gray area, Ben, 22, 24%.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.620]   That's probably gonna be the distribution tax rate
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.000]   for most taxpayers, assuming they have social security,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.540]   assuming they have some savings.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.100]   But for me, that 32% jump on the right,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.040]   to your point, Ben, you never go full Roth.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.920]   And I would not be doing Roth 401ks
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.460]   or heavy Roth conversions at 32% or higher.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.980]   So that's generally the general rule of thumb.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.720]   But Ben, as you might know, everything depends.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.900]   State taxes throw a wrench into things, too.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.180]   But I think maybe my stance on Roth IRAs
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.420]   after all this time has been a little overstated.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.160]   You're present for being on the show 21 times
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.360]   as we're gonna get you a tattoo removal
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.380]   and take that Roth tattoo off your back.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.660]   I'll take it, I'll take it.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.200]   'Cause it's time, it's time to get real.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.840]   So unfortunately, guys, with all things, it depends.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.800]   And that's not a fun question for Ask the Compound,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.680]   but it's the real life question.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.280]   I just think Roths are underused.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.720]   And so I encourage you while you're young
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.860]   and you're not making a ton of money,
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.700]   just fill those buckets up.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.120]   Yeah, but maybe if you are getting up there
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.140]   and you're closer to it, then rethink it.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.980]   That makes sense.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.820]   Yep, 100%.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.800]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   Great.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.700]   Cool, okay, up next we have a question from Evelyn.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.060]   I'm 32 years old and hoping to retire.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.400]   They put retire in quotes, so I'm not sure what that means.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.280]   But hoping to retire before 59 and a half.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.160]   I'm planning on using investment accounts
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.000]   to supplement my income until I can withdraw
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.800]   from retirement accounts penalty-free.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.200]   Since capital gains taxes are 15%,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.320]   does it make sense to max out my Roth IRA
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.700]   and assume a 10% penalty on early withdrawals
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.160]   before investing in a traditional brokerage account?
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.640]   Bill, I think I've asked you this before.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.560]   What's the half about?
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.040]   Why do we do the half?
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.020]   The half is nuts to me.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.560]   The only people who will celebrate half birthdays
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.760]   are my six-year-olds.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.780]   Why do we do this?
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.000]   I mean, speak for yourself.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.440]   And the internal revenue service, right?
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.520]   No, it's completely insane.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.760]   Can we just make it 60 or 59 even?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.600]   Right.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.200]   Make the math easy for me when I'm calculating it, yeah.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.980]   So a great question from Evelyn.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.200]   And this gets to me--
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.720]   Hang on, before you answer,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.360]   I'm going to throw out my--
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.720]   Is a taxable account the simple answer here?
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.160]   I mean, yes, it is.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   I think so.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.000]   And ultimately, again,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.760]   you don't want all your assets in one bucket, right?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.360]   You do want diversification.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.800]   But to flip the switch completely on my prior comment,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.600]   one of the benefits of a Roth IRA in retirement
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.120]   is you get this favorable distribution in distributions,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.580]   this favorable taxation.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.360]   You always get your contributions back tax-free.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.480]   And so if you've been funding diligently a Roth IRA
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.860]   for years, for years, for years,
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.200]   and then you begin distributions at 55,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.000]   more than likely, unless you're taking a full distribution,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.960]   the first X amount of earnings that's going to come out
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.320]   is going to be your contributions.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.840]   You're not going to pay any income tax.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.320]   So that to me lends it
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.560]   to this type of early retirement scenario
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.820]   where, okay, I've got a big traditional bucket.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.800]   I've got a Roth bucket, but I'm 57.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.640]   I need money for the next two years.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.080]   Take it from the Roth, right?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.840]   Because you're just going to get your contributions
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.680]   back tax-free.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.040]   So some sort of combination of a Roth
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.940]   and a taxable account gives you pretty good
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.240]   for early retirement to then do the IRAs
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.520]   and 401ks later, the traditional ones.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.320]   - Exactly, and so the new back tattoo
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.960]   is going to be tax diversification with representation
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.080]   or something of that nature.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.200]   Duncan, I need your help to war game this thing
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   before I put you into skin.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.880]   - I used to live in D.C.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.400]   That was basically our license plate.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.240]   - It's great.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.060]   - Taxation without representation.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.900]   - It's very powerful.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.720]   Live free or die, I think Vermont.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.240]   That's news number two.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.720]   - If you go to prison with that tattoo,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.320]   you are immediately Andy Dufresne.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.280]   - A lot of prison talk on the last two
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.600]   Ask the Compound side.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.360]   - I think then you tell people, "EY Roth."
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.160]   You're referring to EY Roth.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.480]   - I mean, this is kind of talking our own book a little bit
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.280]   but it is a lot of these questions remind me
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.960]   that when you get to a certain point
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.220]   and you ask these questions and they are so circumstantial
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.940]   to your point, Bill, that's when it probably makes sense
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.960]   to talk to someone and get more clarity
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.820]   and not try to do anything.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.460]   I actually had a question today, Bill,
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.460]   at the conference, the financial advisors asked me
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.440]   how I manage my own money and I was talking
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.160]   and I said, "We don't have an agreement in place,"
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.680]   but I said, "Bill Sweet is technically my financial advisor.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.180]   "If I have a financial planning question or tax question,
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.520]   "I go to you," and they all kind of said,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.160]   "Oh, that's interesting that you have your own advisor."
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.000]   Sometimes that's, instead of trying to figure it all out
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.520]   yourself and hitting your head against the wall,
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.720]   you go to someone who has expertise and let them help you.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.600]   - And it is an honor and a privilege,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.520]   something I don't take lightly.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.920]   But my question is, Ben, are we even gonna have retirement
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.080]   if this Canadian smoke monster keeps consuming New York City?
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.740]   John, can you share the photos that Duncan took yesterday?
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.860]   This is the view from my office
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.460]   and I don't know what it looks like today
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.840]   because I escaped from New York like Snake Plissken,
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.600]   I got the hell out of there, but that is some wild--
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.320]   - What's the over and under on Blade Runner?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.440]   Blade Runner jokes being made in New York right now.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   - Why are we all in the middle
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.920]   of a Frank Miller Mad Max set all of a sudden?
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.640]   Ben, should we build a border wall
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.040]   to contain this Canadian smoke?
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.320]   You're north of the wall right now.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.160]   What do you think?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.000]   Like giant fans? - I think we're pretty clear
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.600]   up here, I think we need more fans.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.040]   - Is this what the Chinese weather balloon was researching?
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.680]   My question, too, is what is wrong
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.360]   with smoke from American fires?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.000]   Why typical Biden administration policy, Duncan,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.820]   that we're here importing foreign smoke
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.040]   when homegrown Americans small batch smoke
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   made right here in the USA, that's what I'm into.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.760]   - You know, Nicole shared a funny meme
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.160]   or video clip from "Parks and Rec"
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.440]   where Ron Swanson is asking about writing a letter
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.160]   to Canada and he just writes, it's just an expletive,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.040]   it's basically like F you or something, it's pretty funny.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.000]   - So Ben, have you gone to Montreal to save us?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.440]   That's my question.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.080]   - I'm trying to get away from the smoke, I guess.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.340]   Things look beautiful here, I'm fine.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.640]   - They sent all the smoke south, they exported all that.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.600]   - We do have plenty of Canadian viewers
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.800]   of all of our content, which we appreciate.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.880]   - Molson.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.560]   - Yeah, I had a Molson at the bar last night.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.580]   They said it's the real stuff,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.520]   not the kind of stuff you can get in the US.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.760]   - Have you seen a moose anywhere?
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.680]   - A mountie? - No moose in the city.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.520]   - Yeah, no.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.760]   I have a question before we wrap up.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.560]   I have a question that I just asked the chat.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.880]   So you guys talked about an animal spirits bin.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.040]   Is the bear market over?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.880]   Can we celebrate?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.680]   Can we do confetti?
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.360]   - Sure, let's do it.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.280]   Then we'll celebrate again when we hit new highs.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.120]   - Okay.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.000]   - The bear market will end
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.920]   when the smoke over New York City clears.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.380]   - See, I thought you were gonna hedge the ocean.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.220]   - Yeah.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.040]   - I thought you were gonna hedge more,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   so I didn't actually have anything ready.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:08.880]   - I don't.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.020]   It's like with the Pope dying, there's smoke in New York,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.080]   it means the bear market is over.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.920]   When smoke hits Wall Street, it's done.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.980]   - There you go, they've chosen a new president of Canada.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.200]   - If you have a question, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
