[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.760]   It's Friday. On Fridays on Radical Personal Finance, we do live Q&A. I've got the call
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:52.280]   open. Let's see what comes up today.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.660]   Thank you for being with me. This is the show where we work hard on figuring out the strategies
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.040]   and tools to live a rich life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.400]   less. Fridays we do a live Q&A, which is open to patrons of the show. At the moment, I know
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.360]   we're going to talk about buying property in an LLC or an S corporate. We're going to
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   talk about life insurance and disability insurance.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.880]   We'll see if anybody else jumps on the phone while we're in the middle of recording this
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.440]   show. Basically, the way it works is on Fridays I show up to a phone line. I actually record
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.080]   on the day before. On Fridays I show up to a phone line and I open the phone line up
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.720]   and I see who's there and see what we want to talk about and we just hit record and go
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.720]   from there.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.760]   Today, we've got some interesting questions online. If you'd like to join a show like
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.360]   this in the future, this is going to be your best way. If you'd like to talk to me about

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.240]   in California, welcome to the Q&A call. Let me know how I can serve you today.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.000]   Hi, Joshua. Thank you very much for taking my call. In episode 346, you had Jules Hasson,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.080]   a real estate attorney. He spoke about buying property in an S-Corporate LLC. I'm interested
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.240]   in your take on that from not buying rental property or other business property, but rather
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.120]   your own personal household. He mentioned trying to protect yourself from a liability
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.880]   perspective. I'm wondering about buying property in that sort of structure or just on your
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.360]   own as a private person and maybe where liability insurance will come into play with that.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.480]   Okay. It's a good question. My answer will be – I'll tell you what I know about it
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   and what I think about it. The challenge is that this will be heavily state-dependent.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.560]   So let me answer from my perspective first. I know you're in California. It's very
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.280]   different. But here in Florida, we have an unlimited homestead exemption from the claims
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.880]   of creditors. So in Florida, in the state of Florida, if you own your own house that
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.120]   you live in, there's no dollar limit as to how much of that is protected from the
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.440]   claims of creditors for any reason. I could own a $30 million property. I could have no
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.280]   assets whatsoever. Somebody can win a judgment against me, win a lawsuit against me, and
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.600]   they can collect – it's their judgment fair and square. But I can continue to own
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.200]   that $30 million of property without any limits on it from the claims of creditors of liability
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.940]   perspective and also from the perspective of bankruptcy. So this is a really useful
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.880]   thing – feature in the state of Florida.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.720]   Now, I believe that Florida is the only one – only state that has that unlimited exemption
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.760]   where there's no maximum dollar amount. There are about a handful of states that have
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   very high limits. I don't know the states off the top of my head. I know Texas comes
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.760]   to mind. I don't know anything about your California laws. But some of them do have
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.800]   fairly high limits and then the other states kind of filter in. So for me in the state
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.400]   of Florida, I would not put my personal residence into any kind of entity because if I did,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.480]   I would lose that very valuable protection that I've just mentioned. I would always
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.040]   want to make sure that I own my property as a homestead and that I own it in my name.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.200]   I would also want to make sure that if I'm married, I want to make sure that my spouse
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.720]   and I own it in our names together so that we can also get the benefits of a joint tenancy
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.560]   – tenancy by the entirety I believe is the standard in Florida so we can get the benefits
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.160]   of that joint tenancy of ownership.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.360]   That benefit to me in Florida trumps anything else. It is – that's the biggest benefit
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.240]   to owning real property as a personal homestead in the state of Florida. Now, if I were in
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.760]   another state, what I would do is I would need to check what those limits are in that
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.040]   state and you would look and you would see. Most states will protect your personal residence
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.400]   to some degree. Generally, there would be few advantages to putting a personal residence
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.280]   into an entity. So that would be what I would check.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   I don't know about California law. Do you know anything, Jim, before I go on? Do you
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.640]   know anything about California law with regard to the homestead exemptions?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.680]   I don't. I just recently moved here in the last two years when I retired from the military
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   so that's something I need to look into. But I have had rental property in the past
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.840]   in Virginia and one of my neighbors helped me unload something out of a pickup truck
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.960]   one day and came over and said that he hurt his back helping me unload it and he would
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.160]   like to make a claim against my homeowner's policy. I thought the guy was a pretty good
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.440]   guy overall and so that's what prompted me as soon as I had to rent that house out
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   to make sure that I had a liability policy in place just as extra protection because
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.680]   it was no longer my primary residence. It was a rental property. So that's why I've
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.560]   kept that liability policy. Even after getting rid of the rental property, I kept the liability
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.880]   policy just as a general good measure because a million dollars of liability is so cheap
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.240]   to get these days. So I just kept that. But my wife and I are about to buy a house out
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.080]   here in California so I just thought I'd start looking into that. So great answer and
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   I thank you very much.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   A couple quick ideas. I did look into the California number while you were talking and
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.320]   here is the homestead exemption amount for bankruptcy in California. In California, system
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   one, single homeowners who are not disabled may exempt up to $75,000 of the equity in
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.040]   their home or other property covered by the homestead exemption. You may exempt up to
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.360]   $100,000 if you live with a family member, $175,000 if you are 65 or older or physically
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.440]   or mentally disabled, $175,000 if 55 or older, single and earn a gross annual income under
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   $25,000 or are married and earn a gross annual income under $35,000 and creditors seek to
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.600]   force the sale of your home.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.220]   So there we've got that. Now in California, you also need to remember that you are a community
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:31.480]   property state and so you need to – that has a little bit of a unique twist. California
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:39.200]   is a community property state. So that should answer the question there. I generally – beyond
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:48.080]   that, I don't know about liability limits. The challenge – and here's where I could
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.560]   be stepping on thin ice but as I understand the intent of the law and I welcome any of
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.720]   my listeners who are subject matter experts to come by today's show on the blog page
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.120]   and correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.360]   But in general, entity selection will work well for things like rental properties because
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   you're actually operating a business. So if you desire to put a piece of property into
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.880]   a trust, you're operating a business and so you can make the argument that this is
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   a separate entity and it should be treated as a separate entity. But if I'm just simply
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   owning a house and I'm just doing it purely from the – with the idea of a liability
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.160]   protection scheme of some kind, the problem is I don't have a real reason for that entity
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.560]   to exist.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.520]   And so in the legal world, they call it piercing the corporate veil. Just because you have
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.720]   a business that is operating – that has a business name, but it doesn't mean that
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.160]   you're going to be exempt from the claims of creditors. Now, different states have different
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.040]   rules as to when they'll pierce that corporate veil. But they will actually go in and say,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.360]   "Look, you're just simply you. You're operating as you. You're not operating here
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.400]   as a business."
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.480]   And my guess would be that that's the kind of thing that would apply in a personal property
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.880]   situation from the perspective of liability. The simplest thing to do if you wanted to
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   disconnect yourself for some of the reasons of having an easier transfer, the simplest
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.480]   thing to do would be to set up a living trust and consider just simply buying the property
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.200]   within a living trust.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.040]   That way, you get some of the benefits of – you get some of the benefits of easy transfer
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.640]   if you're doing this for planning, which is not just liability concerns, but also for
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.120]   planning and it's a little bit simpler.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.040]   Beyond that, we've reached the limit of my knowledge and I invite any listeners who
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.000]   are more knowledgeable to come by and comment on the question. So, that helpful, Jim? Anything
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   else?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.560]   Yes, very helpful. No, that's it, Joshua. Thank you very much and keep having a great
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560]   podcast.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.040]   Great. Thank you so much. All right, Nick, you're up next. How can I serve you today?
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:57.920]   Hi, Joshua. I got a quote from a Northwest Mutual agent for disability insurance and
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:05.000]   some different options for life insurance. He came over, talked to us, took an accounting
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.200]   of our assets and did, I guess, a needs analysis. The disability insurance I'm looking through
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.640]   and it's fairly straightforward. It'll be on top of whatever I have at work. The whole
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.520]   idea was to get something external to work. But the life insurance part, I'm a little
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.560]   confused about based on some of my previous conversations with you. I understand there's
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:35.640]   needs analysis and we have some money saved up and we're trying to pursue financial independence
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:42.720]   here. But the need that came up was he gave a whole life policy and a level term 20-year
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:49.600]   policy option for both me and my wife, but it was only for $125,000. I remember having
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.840]   a conversation with you at some point where you said, and maybe I'm getting it mixed up,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.480]   but basically that anything under a million dollars isn't really worth talking about or
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.360]   worth pursuing when it came to insurance. So either I'm confusing some things or my
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.040]   needs are much less than it's worth pursuing with insurance or maybe I'm just very confused
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   about the whole thing.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.840]   Yeah. So the way that – and I'm going to steer away from any specific commentary
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.720]   on product selection here just due to the nature that in a context like this, I'm
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.840]   not as a financial advisor. I'm not working as a financial advisor. I'm not licensed
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.080]   as a financial advisor. I'm not licensed to sell insurance. But I can help you with
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.960]   talking about a big picture so that in working with an actual agent that you'll be able
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.160]   to figure out what the right solution is for you.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   The way a needs analysis works, it's the best way to determine life insurance, appropriate
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.640]   life insurance coverage. What you do is you say, "Okay, if I died, what would be the
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.320]   expenses that my family has?" The software that an insurance agent will use, there are
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.240]   various software packages, but the software that the insurance agent will use, they'll
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.720]   go ahead and put in the expenses and those expenses will involve a number of things.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.640]   They'll usually – if you've given an insurance agent the information on any debts
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.600]   that you have. So for example, you have a mortgage. You have a car payment. You have
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.960]   various debts. They'll put that information in there. They'll also put in information
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.320]   of your personal expenses.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.040]   One of the challenges with people who are very focused, very focused on financial independence
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.240]   is that challenges – and I say this is a good thing, but challenges from the perspective
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.160]   of understanding the needs analysis is that generally, the expenses are being held under
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.240]   tight control. So let's pretend. Let's make up some numbers. It wouldn't be unusual
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.600]   to have somebody who's pursuing financial independence, working hard, working diligently.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.360]   It wouldn't be unusual to have somebody who's earning $7,000 a month and spending
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.800]   $3,500 a month.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.920]   Now when you put that into a software package at $3,500 a month, you're going to get a
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.800]   relatively low amount of money that's necessary. Now the next thing that plays into it is that
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.760]   the software packages will usually incorporate Social Security benefits to the maximum level.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.040]   So that will include widow and orphan benefits and it will also include retirement benefits.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.680]   So when you run a needs analysis out using that type of software from age – from age
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.160]   say 35 to age say 90, what you'll see is you'll see a lot of inflow and a lot of
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   income coming in from Social Security both now and in retirement.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   And so with these things, when you take a high income and high income drives a high
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.080]   Social Security payment and you filter in a low expense number into the software and
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.580]   then you filter in any other existing say group insurance, things like that that you
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.360]   already have in force and then you filter in the assets, it's not unusual for somebody
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.120]   who has been working hard and saving and accumulating not to need very much insurance.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   And that's probably what came out in this context. When the life insurance agent did
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.720]   the needs analysis, did they include in their Social Security income, widow and orphan benefits
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.400]   and retirement benefits for you?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.440]   Michael: Yes, I believe so.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.280]   Aaron Ross Powell: Okay. So that's a million-dollar inclusion. And it's absolutely the right
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.880]   thing to do to recognize it. But now you have to look at it and you have to say, "Do I
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.680]   want these benefits to be included for the purposes of my life insurance?"
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:31.320]   Now also, did they run, did you tell the agent that your expenses were a low number? Did
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.360]   you give them your current expenses but as compared to your income, did you give them
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.960]   that lower number of your expenses?
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:44.000]   Michael: Yes, I did. And I did not, I did mention that these were our expenses as I'm
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.720]   currently working and able to work at my current job and that they would go up if we took care
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   of, or they would go up if I, you know, something changed, you know, and we had to pay for healthcare
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.000]   outside of my work. But he was taking the situation as it is now. And the reason I think
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.520]   he didn't factor in the expenses with our mortgage was because part of the plan was
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.520]   paying off the mortgage if I die or my wife dies. So that was already kind of built in
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.320]   there. So I basically gave them just the expenses which were, yes, very low.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   So…
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.360]   Aaron Ross Powell: Correct. So the way those software packages work is when you're doing
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.760]   a needs analysis, you input the amount of the immediate cash flow needed to do something
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.680]   like pay off a mortgage. And then you put in there a cash flow need coming in for a
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:43.000]   certain period of time. So the answer to your question is if you have done a good job, you're
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.320]   aggressively pursuing early retirement, financial independence, and you've done a good job
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:57.120]   saving money, your need for insurance is – for life insurance is relatively low because if
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.920]   you have – let's just make up a number. Let's say you have a million dollars sitting
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.840]   in the bank. A million dollars sitting in the bank spending – you know, having – with
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.120]   a paid off house and putting in say $2,500 a month for expenses plus if you counted or
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.560]   didn't count any income for a working spouse, that's another thing that makes a big difference.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.000]   That goes a long way. So you don't actually need that much life insurance. And so the
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.240]   $125,000 number is accurate based upon the calculations used.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.880]   Now here's what – if I were still an insurance agent, if I were working with you, here's
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:36.760]   what I would do. I would question those assumptions. And if I were coming back to you in – given
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   the circumstances you're describing, I would give you – I would start with the same needs
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.560]   analysis that that agent already discussed with you. But then I would explain to you
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   how the numbers work and I would explain to you that I might want to do something a little
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   bit different. The reality is that term life insurance is very cheap. And so I said, "Let's
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.040]   do this. Let's take out Social Security or at least take out Social Security for retirement."
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.320]   Okay? Because that's a huge deal and Nick, you're pretty young, right? You're in
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.320]   your 30s?
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.960]   Nick Loper: Correct, 36.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.360]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.: Okay. So Social Security will not look – if Social Security
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.280]   exists when you go to collect on it, it will not look the way that it collects now. Okay?
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.000]   So I would pull Social Security retirement benefit out. I wouldn't necessarily pull
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.320]   out a widow and orphan benefit. Although I would adjust those because the widow and orphan
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.040]   benefits are pretty simple and they're based upon your current earnings record. But I would
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.760]   pull the Social Security retirement benefit out of the software and I would explain I'm
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.800]   uncomfortable with this being in here and I'm uncomfortable – I'll mention it
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.120]   again for two reasons actually.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.200]   The first one is I'm uncomfortable about predicting it. At the very least, I would
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.040]   never show somebody in their 30s a Social Security retirement benefit under current
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   assumptions. At the very least, I would drop it to 50% of the current benefit.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.440]   Nick Loper: Yeah. I think we went to 75% of current.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.960]   Aaron Ross Powell, Ph.D.: Good. Good. Okay. So you've got an agent who's doing a
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.120]   good job. This is good news. Okay? They're working on this. Okay? But I would – I personally
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.200]   would go to 50% but now we're hemming and hawing and I can't prove that. It's just
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.120]   – it's your guess against my guess. Who knows how to predict the future?
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.100]   The next thing that I would do, the problem with the Social Security analysis is the computer
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.320]   software in these needs analysis packages are predicting that you're going to work
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.160]   until 65. Was that the assumption that you gave him that, "Hey, if I want to see a
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.280]   retirement scenario showing that I'm going to work until 65," was that accurate?
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.440]   That's the assumption he used but we discussed how that might not be the reality. But he
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.480]   ran with that assumption under – looking more normal. And I was okay with that just
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.040]   to get the first number but we're going to have a discussion actually at 2 o'clock.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.520]   So I want to go over some of this stuff with him and see if we can tailor it a little bit
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.000]   more for the longer needs I might have.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.760]   Okay. So the problem with that assumption is if that's in the software as a retirement
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.960]   package and then now the same software is converting over and looking at your life insurance
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.240]   plan, what it's assuming is that you're going to keep working at your current rate
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:16.400]   of income with an increase based upon an inflation rate, usually 3%. And then it's taking those
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.640]   highest 30 years of earnings and it's using that to drive your primary insurance amount
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.840]   which is then also being used – which is being used throughout.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.220]   So the point is that I think it's a high assumption and so I get a little uncomfortable
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:37.420]   about using the social security. To cut to the chase, if you are well on your way towards
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.080]   financial independence, if you died, you would not leave your spouse destitute. So if I were
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.920]   working as a financial advisor, what I would say is, "Listen, you don't need a lot
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.340]   of life insurance. But I'll tell you what. It's pretty cheap and you might just sleep
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.800]   better knowing that you had an extra million dollars of insurance for the next five to
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.560]   ten years. Your rate is X number of dollars a month. Will you feel better knowing that
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.960]   there's an extra million dollars of life insurance?" And a lot of times when I put
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.880]   it like that, I know it's not so precise. The reality is that that's why you're
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.640]   buying life insurance. You're buying life insurance to feel better that you know that
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.800]   at least if you're going to carry it for the next decade or so, you've got plenty
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.640]   of extra money. Do you technically need it? No. And the needs analysis will demonstrate
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:27.120]   exactly precisely how much you need. That is the trustworthy figure. But it's only
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.480]   as good as the assumptions that you put into it. And so the assumption of saying, "We're
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.220]   always going to live on this lower amount of money," might not be accurate. Maybe
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.220]   in the future you might want to spend more. The assumption about Social Security might
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.480]   or might not be accurate. Maybe in the future it will be less. Maybe it will be more. All
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.600]   these assumptions, the assumption about paying off the mortgage, maybe you go get another
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:51.280]   house and now you'll have another mortgage. All those assumptions play a role. And so
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.800]   I wouldn't personally, if I were an agent, I would say, "This is what the number is.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.000]   Do you want to buy a million bucks? It costs you $40 a month, $50 a month, something like
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.200]   that. Do you want to have a million dollars of insurance?" And I would just let you
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.080]   decide on that basis. Do you want it or not?
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.840]   Yeah. A couple of things. I was balancing the need to tell him, obviously, I want him
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.960]   to have true assumptions with the fact that I didn't want to get insurance on the... I
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.480]   didn't want to lie to him and say, "Oh, I'm going to work my whole life," because
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.680]   I know there's something to be said there about you have to have intent of working to
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.800]   get these kind of... Or maybe that's for the disability insurance or something. I have
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:37.280]   a desk job now. I have no intention of quitting my job, but one day I would like to. But I
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.960]   know I can get a certain rate because I'm a desk job right now. So I think that's why
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:48.120]   I was having trouble balancing how to tell him I might have a shorter than normal or
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.000]   average working cycle.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.960]   And the other thing about the assumptions, when I talked to him, I would like to tell
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:00.400]   him, now that I have a baseline quote here, I can tell him, "Okay, I think if either me
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.720]   or my wife died, either of our lives would become much more typical than they are now
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.560]   because we're leveraging each other to be able to do this kind of extreme saving or
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.000]   somewhat better saving rate than maybe is typical. But I think if either of us died
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.280]   and had to deal with the children and life and working and all that, our needs would
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.720]   start lining up much more typical with an average person's, and the savings rate would
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.280]   obviously go way down. So those are the kind of things I think I need to help him update
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   the assumptions with.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.160]   - Right. So a financial plan or a needs analysis is always just simply a draft document, and
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.060]   you should treat it as such. You should always treat it as a draft document. The difference
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:52.620]   between you, Nick, and most people is in most insurance sales presentations, the needs analysis
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:58.500]   is simply used as a sales tool. It's simply used as a tool to say, "Look, I've done something
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.680]   that looks fancy." Most people don't read them. They don't use them. You give them to
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.800]   them and they just toss it in the corner of the desk and they don't ever look at it again
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:14.640]   because most people, they look at numbers and their eyes glaze over. So that's the actual
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.280]   reality that most insurance agents and most financial advisors get used to is when they're
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.640]   constantly – the stuff is constantly ignored.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.560]   So what a financial advisor learns to do if they want to be effective at sales is they
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.120]   learn to point to the pictures and not to the numbers because the numbers make most
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.600]   people's eyes glaze over and you can see it. When you're in a sales presentation,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.160]   you can see you – you can watch the client or prospective client get lost. So you learn.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.040]   You point to the number. You point to the pictures and you try to skip past all the
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.680]   pages of text. The questions you're asking are all about all the pages of text and that's
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   good.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.760]   So what you need – what I would recommend that you do is articulate the fact to the
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.360]   insurance agent. Articulate to them, "Hey, I'm not just looking at the pictures. I'm
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   looking at the numbers and I want to really understand these assumptions. Let's go over
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.320]   this together and let's just figure out what is the assumption that is correct and
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.760]   what's the assumptions that's not correct." The insurance agent can take that same tool
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:22.360]   that he's using and he can create a very detailed, carefully oriented solution for
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.280]   you based upon your situation.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:32.200]   So if you want to suppress social security, suppress social security. If you want to demonstrate
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.400]   that you're retiring at 35, demonstrate that you're retiring at 35. You can change
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.600]   every one of those assumptions. Just make sure that you go over with them what are the
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.520]   assumptions being used in the plan and then now how do we apply them to my situation.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.560]   The software is good. It helps with the calculations but software is only as good as the data that's
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.440]   input. So spend a lot of time talking to the agent about your actual data that's being
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   input and at the end of the day, you very well might just simply come up like I said
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:07.280]   of, "Hey, how much is it? I know I only need $125 or $300 but let me just go ahead
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.400]   and buy half a million or buy a million."
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.440]   The reason that I said on a previous show of I don't really take it seriously when
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.140]   people say I want to buy a million dollars, I'm not talking about that in the context
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.820]   of somebody who's saved a million dollars. I'm talking about that in the context of
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:26.400]   people who are saying, "Well, I want to – I'm flat broke. I'm making $60,000
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.320]   a year but what I want to do is I just want to provide an extra $2,000 a month for the
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.040]   next three years to help in a transition plan." Okay. You can find that but I never really
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.520]   worked with that type of person who was kind of looking at those lower numbers.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.160]   Term life insurance is so stinking cheap that I just don't see the reason why for young
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.360]   families not to have a lot of it. That's not a mathematical calculation. We can figure
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.640]   out the precise mathematics. I'm just saying if you see it as valuable, you'll feel better
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.240]   having a million dollars than having a hundred thousand.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:05.600]   Yeah, yeah. I understand that. That sounds good and I think I have some good stuff to
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   follow up with him about.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.280]   Great. Well, I encourage you and I'm glad you're taking advantage of opportunities
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.240]   like this Q&A call to talk about it and if you're – it sounds like your advisor has
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   had a good start for you and may they continue to serve you. Any other questions you want
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.120]   to ask Nick before we hang up on you?
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.560]   Is there anybody else who has a question or –
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.800]   Go ahead. You're the last caller on for right now so go ahead.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.320]   I mean I guess this one's going to be kind of tough because I don't think you can answer
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   this kind of stuff directly to my situation but in a theoretical situation like mine,
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.840]   would you tend to gravitate towards term or whole life? I know they have different – they're
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.120]   completely different products with different advantages but like you said, the term is
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:51.800]   so much cheaper. Of course, I'm really minded but I've heard you talk about the advantages
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:58.200]   of whole life insurance in the past and I am trying to kind of rectify that with is
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.160]   that something that would serve me or not as far as a product and I'm really not sure
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.760]   which way I'm leaning right now but I know that gets very specific and I'm not sure
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   if you're able to answer that.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   So let's cover term or whole life right first. So this is the first thing that people
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.640]   often struggle with. Should I buy term life insurance or should I buy whole life insurance?
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:25.520]   The best metaphor to understand this would be the metaphor of how you should operate
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.920]   a car. You can rent a car, a cheap economy car in any city in the world for what? 20
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.480]   bucks a day. Sometimes you can get it on sale and it's cheaper but $20, $30 a day in the
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.640]   US at least. I shouldn't say any city in the world. So it's a lot cheaper for you
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   to go and rent a car for $20 or $30 a day than it is for you to go and pay $30,000 to
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.120]   buy a car, right?
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.400]   Ryan: Right.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.680]   Paul: Okay. Now, you can also lease a car. You can lease a cheap economy car in the United
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.800]   States for $150 to $250 a day. Excuse me, $250 a month depending on what deal. Honda
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.840]   is doing their 000 and you go $199 for a new Honda Civic. Great. That's a lot cheaper
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.520]   to lease a car for $199 a month than it is to go and pay $30,000 for a new car, right?
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   Ryan: Correct.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.800]   Paul: Okay. Now, does that mean that you should always rent cars or lease cars and not buy
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.280]   cars? The answer is obvious. No.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280]   Ryan: No. Right.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.200]   Paul: The question of whether you rent or lease or buy is determined upon how long do
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:33.360]   you need to drive and what are your needs. So in a situation where you're looking at
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.160]   – well, let's see because I know that you are working hard towards early retirement.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.080]   In a situation where you're saying, "Hey, I'm working hard towards early retirement.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.000]   I think I've got – I'm just going to make up a number, 10 years left on this thing.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.880]   In 10 years, I'm going to be in a situation where I'm going to be well-suited to provide
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.240]   for myself for the rest of my life." When you're going to own life insurance for 10
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:07.560]   years, you don't buy a whole life insurance for that. You lease that thing. You buy a
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.040]   term insurance policy.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.200]   Now, whether you buy a 10-year term insurance policy or a 15-year term insurance policy
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.440]   or a 20-year term insurance policy, those are details that you've got to work out
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.640]   with an insurance agent because do I want an extra 10 years? Do I need to have the flexibility?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.760]   What if my plan doesn't work? Is my plan predicated upon stock market returns or is
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.800]   my plan predicated upon me selling a business? Do I want to have the flexibility, etc.? That's
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.600]   where a life insurance agent will work through that.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.960]   But the point is if you're going to own a life insurance policy for 10 years, that's
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.920]   a term insurance policy. That's a perfect fit. Young family, my kids are going to be
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.880]   10 years older. You've got 10 years of expenses in the rearview mirror. Term insurance all
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.000]   the way for any kind of short-term need, term insurance. Just like if you're going to
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.560]   rent a car for a five-day trip, you're going to rent the car. You're not going to buy
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:30:01.760]   it. So term insurance is the perfect solution for any kind of short-term insurance need.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:10.320]   Now is whole life insurance the ideal solution for a short-term insurance need? No. It's
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.600]   a terrible, terrible solution for any kind of short-term insurance need. Just like buying
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.960]   a car generally is going to be a very bad move for any kind of short-term thing because
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.920]   you're going to pay taxes on the purchase. You're going to have transaction costs. You
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.800]   don't buy a car and then sell it. Normal people, non-dealers, you don't buy a car and then
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.240]   try to turn around and sell it in an instant. You buy cars when you're going to own them
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.500]   for a relatively long period of time.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.240]   So if you said to me, "Hey, I've got an insurance need that goes beyond 10 years. I've got an
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.440]   insurance need that goes beyond 20 years," now we start to look in a situation where
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.760]   we're going to start to compare the cost of a whole life insurance policy to the cost
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.840]   of a term life insurance policy. Now, these types of insurance needs are generally going
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.960]   to be smaller. If you're looking at a million dollars term life insurance versus a million
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.120]   dollars of whole life insurance, I mean your premium differential is you're looking at
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.560]   $50 a month for a term life insurance policy and $850 a month for a whole life insurance
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:17.480]   policy. So there'd be no reason for somebody with a young family to try to fund the need
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.280]   of protecting a young family with whole life insurance. That's a bad move.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.680]   But if you were looking at your situation, you said, "You know what? I think I'd always
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.120]   like to have some insurance around forever," whether that's just a burial policy or whether
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.200]   it's just to make sure that I have some liquid cash at the time of my death, then you said,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.540]   "Okay. Well, I'll go ahead and here's a $100,000 policy. Here's a $50,000 policy. I'm only
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.680]   going to have this thing around – this thing is going to be around forever, but this is
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.000]   the type of life insurance policy I'm going to want to carry for decades."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.520]   Well, in that situation, that's not really a term insurance solution. That's a whole
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.000]   life insurance policy. When you're dealing with a normal young family situation like
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.120]   that, if you've got the disposable money and if you would value having a life insurance
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:11.240]   policy that's there forever, then that would be the situation that you would look at that
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.100]   because you can't have term life insurance until you're 100 years old. That's a whole
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.300]   life insurance solution.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.640]   Now, let's talk about capital value. You do not make your decision between term life
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:28.620]   insurance and whole life insurance based upon investment returns. You make them based upon
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.820]   insurance because when you buy an insurance policy, you're buying an insurance policy.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.340]   You're not buying an investment.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.500]   Now, when deciding where to get the money from, you look at and understand with a life
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.300]   insurance agent the specific attributes of a whole life insurance policy or if you're
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.220]   looking at a universal life insurance, here's what it is, how it works, what's it invested
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.740]   in, what's the rate of return, etc. How does it work in my situation? If you desire
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:01.480]   to have any of the benefits of it – so for example, one of the reasons why I own whole
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:08.220]   life insurance, if I desire to have a very steady, stable source of cash that's not
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.860]   going to go up and down but it's going to give me slightly better return than I can
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:18.340]   make in a checking account or in a savings account or in CDs, it's going to give me
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.620]   a little bit better than that. It's going to be primarily a bond return but it's going
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.820]   to be owned within the context of a life insurance policy. So there are some attributes there
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:33.520]   where it's more flexible. If I can design a policy that's flexible and that has good
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.680]   cash accumulation, well, in that situation, it's an okay place for a little bit of my
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:43.200]   money. I wouldn't make that my primary source of my investing but I definitely have valued
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.400]   and appreciated having some very, very stable money that's not in the stock market but
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.420]   that's money that's protected and set aside. It gives me a lot of confidence to
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.760]   know that I can access the money anytime I want to but generally, it's just part of
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.500]   my long-term safe savings. It's not a big component of my financial life though. So
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.840]   if I were talking with somebody and if they were talking about, "I want to put a couple
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.400]   percent of my income into something like that," okay, fine. If someone says, "I'm
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.720]   going to make this my primary investment vehicle," I would be very uncomfortable with that, me
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.360]   personally. So that's how I approach it.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.080]   The trouble with whole life insurance is you've got those two things compounded and people
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.500]   mix up the conversation and that's why it always goes so cattywampus. First, you decide
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.260]   what is the nature of the insurance policy that I want to need. Then, if you're looking
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:41.700]   at it from an investment perspective, then you understand what is the situation, what
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.100]   is the reason why I've done it. When I was an insurance agent, I sold whole life insurance
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:50.180]   policies into both of those situations but the approach is very different. This is where
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.860]   the individual has to make up the difference. If you're just buying a $50,000 policy,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.940]   I'm not going to go on and on and on about the cash value and how investment return
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.380]   and any of those things. It's just a whole life insurance policy. It's going to have
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.460]   some cash value. It's going to have an okay rate of return, probably less than your
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.380]   stocks, probably about equal to your bonds. Maybe it could be a little bit better, a little
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.100]   worse depending on how the company does. But you're just buying a life insurance policy
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.100]   to have forever.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.980]   That's different than some of the situations where – I can think of a couple of situations
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:24.300]   where I was specifically selling it for the benefit of the cash value. In those situations,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.840]   there was one where we're coming in, we're talking, okay, putting hundreds of thousands
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.260]   of dollars of premiums into the policy. Well, there, it's a little bit about the death
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:37.820]   benefit but there, it was primarily about the cash. So you've got to do a rigorous
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.620]   analysis of it and that's how you should look at it in your situation. Why am I buying
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.180]   the policy? You don't buy a million dollars of life insurance early in your life when
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.420]   you don't have a lot of money of whole life insurance just because of the cash value.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.500]   No, you buy term life insurance to protect the needs of your family. If you want a small
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.460]   policy that's going to last forever, that's the best move. It's better to get it when
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.380]   you're younger. But if you're going to look at it from an investment perspective,
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.700]   it's a different conversation and term isn't even in the question there. So disconnect
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   the decisions.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:11.860]   Okay. Yeah, that makes sense and that kind of lines up with what I was kind of feeling
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:19.220]   in my gut even without having done a spreadsheet of all the costs. But like you said, I think
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:24.660]   the need was for term initially. The benefits of the whole life did seem attractive but
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:31.540]   the cost of it far outweighed. I mean, what's the point of having cash flow from a whole
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:39.740]   life insurance later if it means my plan goes from whatever, let's say it goes to plan
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:45.500]   and like I said, it is relying on some fortunes of the market and all that stuff. But if things
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.060]   go well and it goes from, let's say it goes from 10 years to 20 years just because I have
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:56.380]   this now large expense, which would be my second largest expense I think by far after
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:02.340]   my mortgage, it doesn't make sense to add that for the minimal benefit and extending
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.820]   the real goal out almost double. So, and that's just kind of like my gut feeling about how
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.940]   much farther that would extend it out. But yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think I'm,
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:19.660]   I know where to focus my questions now on term and also the assumption of the needs.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.660]   So I appreciate it very much. Thank you.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:28.260]   For sure. Talk to the insurance agent and ask the difficult questions. The only key
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.060]   to remember, they're not the same. They're not the equivalent. You're not trying to decide
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.860]   between a blue car and a red car. You're trying to decide between a pickup truck and a Maserati.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:42.620]   Now, I'm not comparing either. I'm just saying they're very different. So the question is
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:48.060]   not should I pick either or? The question is what's appropriate for my situation and
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.340]   the goals that I have? And if you understand the benefits of each and then ask yourself,
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.420]   do I value these goals? Signing up for a life insurance payment that's going to be a huge
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:04.340]   component of your budget, that can be very, very frustrating to have. And personally,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.740]   if I were an insurance agent, having learned the hard way, I would probably discourage
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.940]   you from that because you would probably bail on the policy in too short of a time. But
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.100]   it doesn't mean, it just means identify the situation. And that's what it is with all
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:24.260]   financial planning. So wish you the best and I hope this information sets you on a good
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.660]   foot for your conversation with your agent.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:32.740]   Yeah, I think it certainly will. I appreciate it. I'll be focusing on disability insurance
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.500]   next week. So in the next few weeks, I'm going to start looking at this stuff. I'm trying
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500]   to take it one bite at a time.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.900]   Great. Awesome. I wish you all the best, Nick. Thank you all so much for listening to these
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:50.820]   Q&A shows. I hope that they're interesting and give you a useful tool in your pocket
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.500]   to think about some of these things. Key piece of advice when you're working with people,
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.540]   with financial people, ask lots and lots and lots of questions. If you ask lots and lots
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.180]   of questions and you're working with an agent or with an advisor of some kind, you will
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:12.540]   start to see and hear the different approaches. People are very leery and very wary of insurance
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:18.300]   agents, financial advisors, etc. And I think it's probably a deserved reputation. But just
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.420]   because you're leery of them doesn't mean that you can't educate yourself. You can't
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:27.940]   take the information and then apply it yourself and make a good decision for yourself. Don't
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.100]   be intimidated by people. Just ask lots of questions and then understand what the benefits
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.260]   are and ask yourself, "Do I value this?" And hopefully you'll be able to make better decisions.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.500]   If you'd like to join a call like this in the future, become a patron of the show, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.620]   If you would like to consult with me individually, I do have that option available for you. You
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.060]   can consult with me individually on your personal situation. If you don't want your financial
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:55.780]   details broadcast like in a show like this, you'll notice a lot of times with callers,
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.700]   I'm intentionally being vague and just trying to give them a little bit of privacy. But
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.500]   if you'd like to talk about personal details with me on something, I'd be happy to consult
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:10.540]   with you. I'm not an insurance agent nor am I a financial advisor, so I can't make any
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   specific recommendations on anything that you should or shouldn't do with an insurance
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.540]   policy and I can't make any specific recommendations on whether you should sell out of the market
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.020]   at the high point or get rid of this stock or things like that. But the good news is
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.980]   the vast – that's the tiny minority of financial decisions. Everything else in your
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.340]   personal situation, I'd be happy to consult with you on. As long as it doesn't involve
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.940]   the sale of security or the sale of insurance product, I'm cool. So if you'd like to
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:43.980]   have information on that, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall and you can book a personal consulting call
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.940]   with me. And in the meantime, I wish you all the best. Have a great week and be back with
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.220]   you soon.
