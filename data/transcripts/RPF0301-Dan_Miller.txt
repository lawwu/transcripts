[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.600]   of 48 Days fame.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:47.440]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.600]   Today I'm sitting here with Dan Miller and he's going to enlighten us
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.360]   on the theme of the show which is how to live a rich life now and how to build a plan for financial
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.920]   freedom in 10 years or less. Drove up to Tennessee sitting here across from him. Sit back, get ready
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:19.120]   to relax and gain some real knowledge. Dan, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. This is the treat to
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.040]   be able to sit across the desk from a guest of the show. Well, thanks. This makes it easy for me when
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.920]   you just show up here in my office. Indeed. So I'd love to first have you just share a little bit of
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280]   your background. Many of my listeners will be familiar. I've recommended your books, your
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.800]   courses to them in the past. But how did you wind up becoming known as the career guru?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   You know, it really wasn't as a strategic career move on my part which may sound kind of
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.040]   counterintuitive because I help people plan out so strategically their careers. But this kind of
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.680]   snuck up on me. I mean, I'm an entrepreneur from the top of my head to the tip of my toes.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   So I was always doing entrepreneurial things. But it was at a time when Joanne, my wife and I,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.160]   were teaching a Sunday school class. We just were serving our community, serving in the church. We
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.960]   were teaching a Sunday school class on career life transitions, these inevitable, relentless
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.880]   kind of changes that show up. And it was like a vacuum. I mean, we started having people come from
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.680]   not only other states, but other churches who had come to that Sunday school class.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.360]   We moved it to a Monday night so it would make it easier for people. But it was a time where we
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   realized this was not an issue that was just confronting the 18-year-old who just lost his
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.920]   job at Burger King. We were having chiropractors and physicians and dentists and attorneys and
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.440]   pastors show up who are saying, "You know, people think I'm doing okay, but I'm not sure I'm on the
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   right track." So it opened this amazing door of opportunity to help people walk through these
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.840]   kind of changes. But it came about in a way that I wasn't prepared for. I wasn't predicting.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.080]   But with that, being a sounding board for people and walking through them with the transitions
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.880]   helped me very quickly to develop materials that people started asking for. And I just opened this
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.680]   very entrepreneurial journey that I love being on anyway in this area, this very area. So now I can
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.520]   teach, coach, speak, write on the very topic that drew me in the door.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.360]   - And the good thing is that your area of expertise is in demand in good times and bad.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.120]   Because in good times, people need to change and in bad times, they need to change.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   - You're exactly right. I was asked, actually in Fox Business News not very long ago about
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.520]   that very thing. How does a recession, how does a slowdown affect my business? And I said, "I'm in
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.800]   a pretty unique business. If things are bad, my business is really good. If things are good,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.000]   my business is really good." For exactly what you just identified, Josh. If things are bad,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.680]   people are saying, "Man, I need some new options." And so they're looking for things
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.840]   like we helped to offer them. If things are really good, they realize they're in the driver's seat.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.880]   Now's the time to take, to put wings on that dream they had back when they were 20 years old.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.800]   - Right. So you just mentioned recession. And there are two themes that I wanted to talk to
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.840]   you about. And of course, we'll see what unfolds during the course of the interview. But the two
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.320]   themes are, number one, what would be some ideas and strategies, useful strategies to prepare for
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   recession? It's my guess, we're recording this in early 2016, my guess that in the next year or two,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.280]   we might very well be back in recession. That's just a personal guess. It's been quite a number
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.960]   of years since we've been in recession and they come around kind of like buses. Every once in a
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.040]   while, there's another one. So I've been trying to help my audience to think contrarian. When times
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.080]   are good, that's the time to prepare for the bad times. And when times are bad, that's the time to
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.440]   make plans for when times are better. And then the second one is I want to talk about entrepreneurship
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.680]   and how to teach that to the younger generation. But let's start with recession. Do you think that
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.600]   it's a valid career strategy to plan for, to make career plans and job plans to prepare for recession?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320]   Is that something you think about and teach about? No.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:16.880]   The short answer, I'm one of these guys, I'm an eternal optimist. If I find horse turds in my
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.040]   mailbox, I'm looking for a pony. I'm not upset at somebody. I know there's something good close by.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.880]   It's just how I'm wired. When I hear people talk about, "You remember that recession we went through
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.160]   back in 2008, 2009, which was probably the last big downturn?" I don't even remember that. I don't
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   remember that as having any impact on me at all. And I don't want to just be some Pollyanna, put my
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.440]   head in the sand. But I think if we've really discovered work that engages the very best of
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.280]   what we have to offer, work that we love, if we're really serving people well, I think there are
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.560]   opportunities for that no matter what the economy is doing. I mean, my success, this is something I
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.400]   talk about frequently, but my success, your success has very little to do with what the economy is
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.560]   doing. It has very little to do with what's happening in the White House. It has a whole
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.320]   lot to do with what's happening in your house. So I'm with you. I remember years ago, I used to
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.120]   love listening to, I spent years listening to Zig Ziglar tapes. And he would always say,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.560]   he's my favorite, one of my favorite jokes is, "Economists have successfully predicted 17 of the
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.680]   last three recessions." And the point is that you can prepare and you can be insulated. But what
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.480]   have you done that allowed you to come through 2008 and 2009 unscathed? Because I'll tell you,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.800]   I was doing financial planning at that point in time, and there were a lot of people impacted by
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   it. What did you do that my clients and friends and acquaintances didn't do?
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:59.040]   Well, part of that, and I know you're a financial guy, and I don't consider that to be one of my
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.160]   areas of expertise. So I don't do the kind of traditional things that people who are in the
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.680]   financial markets do. I mean, and it's not that I don't have a bag of money under my mattress,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.520]   trust me, it's not that. But I don't worry too much about markets because they don't impact the
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   kind of things that I'm doing. I mean, I like real estate, I like cars, I like things I can
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.720]   touch and feel. But even in just the day-to-day things, the reason those trends don't impact me
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.480]   a whole lot is because I'm always looking for what are the current needs of people out here?
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.200]   What are people asking me about? One of the mantras that has served me really well in my
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.040]   business is if three people ask me the same question, I create a product. I mean, that's why
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.960]   we have the events that we do. That's why I write the books that I do. That's why we have the
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.400]   courses that we do. Those have all come directly out of people asking me, how can I do that?
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.160]   I mean, a few years ago, my good friend Dave Ramsey and I started a little group, we called it
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   our little mastermind, and we had guys meeting together. Well, he would mention it, the impact
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.120]   of that on our lives and how it affected the trajectory of our business. He'd have people
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.920]   ask about it, I'd have people ask about it. Well, gee, can we be in that group? No, you can't. I
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.960]   mean, it's a closed group. It changes if there's 200 guys in a room as compared to 12. But my
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.560]   response was, well, just start your own. Well, then the next question, obviously, is how do I do that?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.080]   So I wrote a little ebook on how you start your own mastermind. Well, that did extremely well
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.800]   for us. We started hearing stories from people all over who had done exactly that. I thought,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.240]   man, that's a hot topic. So I pulled it back in. We've made it a little more robust as a course.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.960]   So now the course is available. $48, we've had thousands of people who have purchased that.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.920]   But it's not sophisticated, it's not high technology, it's just paying attention to
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.800]   what are people asking about and then providing help to help them through that. And those
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.440]   opportunities are going to be there no matter what the economy is, no matter who's in political power,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.320]   no matter who's in the White House, no matter where I am in the world, frankly. I mean, I could
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.120]   go anywhere in the world and duplicate what I'm doing. And I don't say that just, you know,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:20.800]   flippantly, because everything requires intensity and intentionality and strategy. But I think we
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.920]   can insulate ourselves from these ups and downs that seemingly affect people so readily and in
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.240]   ways that I really don't understand. - Is the insulation just simply
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   taking the mindset of an entrepreneur? When you hear people complaining about a problem,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   you say, well, how can I fix this? How can I make this problem go away? Is that the
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.920]   primary method or do you have some other ideas that would help my listeners insulate themselves?
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.880]   - Well, that is a lot of it, I'm sure. I mean, I don't get up in the morning worried about,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.320]   is the company going to survive and give me a paycheck on Friday? I've never had a real job.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.360]   I've never done. - Never?
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   - Ever, never, ever. All I've ever done since I was a little kid is just find opportunities and
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   just put legs on, just live it out. So, and I mean, at one point I had a business where we were
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.200]   doing a lot of car customization. We were doing accessories on cars. And it was one of those
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.040]   times, well, this was years ago, but there was a real spike in gas prices. And all of a sudden,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.520]   car sales slowed down and my primary customers were new car dealers. And my mother said, Dan,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.920]   what are you going to do if car sales stop? It'll kill your business. I said, mama,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.760]   I'll be putting pinstripes on buggies because people are going to have transportation. I mean,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.400]   even that didn't scare me because if we resort to another kind of transportation,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.360]   I'll adjust my business to adjust the needs that are there. So I've never been held captive by a
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.960]   particular company or particular industry thinking, well, if this doesn't go really well,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.280]   then I can't make the mortgage payment. I mean, but I'm the kind of guy too. Now, you know, I
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:04.400]   enjoy being an author, speaker, coach, but if something happened tomorrow that I couldn't do
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.320]   that, I guarantee you tomorrow morning, I'm going to have a lawn mowing business, a window washing
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.680]   business, a car detailing business. I don't care. I could take 10 things and be back in business
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.280]   tomorrow and do perfectly fine and just providing good service to people who need it.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.240]   - Why would you go and start all of those businesses instead of going and getting a job?
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:35.120]   - Oh my, well, there's a lot of reasons. I would be an employee, employer's nightmare
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.760]   as an employee. I would suck at being an employee. I just don't think in terms of I have to be
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.280]   somewhere at eight o'clock and be there till five o'clock, sit in a cubicle and produce something
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   where I know they're going to buy me at wholesale and sell me at retail. I want you to think about
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.960]   it. There's gotta be the case. I just am not wired that way. I like the freedom, the independence.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.320]   Now with that, the unpredictability, sign me up. No problem at all. That energizes me, not knowing,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:14.400]   but there's never been times where I was really concerned. Wow, am I going to be able to make it?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.840]   Because if I think that I'm short on making the mortgage payment, by golly, I'll be out here doing
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   something else. And there've been times, I've spent a lot of time in graduate school, getting
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.680]   all those fancy degrees to hang those pieces of paper on my wall that have very little connection
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:36.400]   with what I do perhaps, but I enjoy the process. But to make that possible, I didn't go get student
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   loans, not a chance. I mean, if I'm in graduate school, getting a master's degree in clinical
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.600]   psychology, which I did, during that period of time, we lived in a house where we never paid
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.200]   rent when I was there because I worked it off in doing improvements in the house. The landlord was
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.160]   thrilled having us there at all the things that I did, and we just counted it against the rent.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.960]   So I never paid rent. I did other things. I'd never looked for a job, but I would bid painting
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.480]   houses so I could do it on my own time. If I was doing inside of a house, I could start at nine
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.440]   o'clock at night after all my other duties were finished with school. I could start nine o'clock
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.760]   at night, work till two o'clock. I was paid by the project, never by the hour. I've never bid a job
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.960]   by the hour, always by the project. So there's just opportunities everywhere. So I would,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.720]   there was a time, and I'll tell you a real specific time, Joshua, where one of my business
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   ideas, I jumped in with both feet like I tend to do, burned the bridges, and all of a sudden,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:46.080]   things didn't go well in that particular business. And I had a big downturn financially,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.440]   sold the business at public auction, woke up the next morning, I was about $430,000 in debt.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.160]   A lot of that to the IRS. They don't just walk away from that. They can be pretty nasty,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.240]   which we discovered. But I had a choice. At that point, I did have a graduate degree. I was
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.560]   teaching as an adjunct professor. I could have easily gotten a full-time position there making
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.800]   $60,000, $70,000 a year. But now you do the math on that. I had three kids at home. I owed $430,000.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   I was raised where your word is your bond. So I was not going to file bankruptcy, even though it
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.000]   was a legitimate option. I was not going to do that. But I thought, if I make $60,000, $70,000
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.120]   a year, we're going to barely live on that. I'm not going to be able to work away. I'll never see
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.480]   the light of day again. So what did I do instead of getting a job, which would have been a very
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.440]   responsible thing to do in other people's eyes, not a chance. Jump right back in the entrepreneurial
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.440]   game. Jump right back in. In that period of time, I got a position where it was 100% commissioned
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.240]   sales. So I used somebody's umbrella for business structure, 100% commissioned sales, and very
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.960]   quickly got myself back where I was making $8,000, $10,000 a month to start getting myself out of the
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.520]   hole and immediately started planning what is my next entrepreneurial venture going to be.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.120]   I agree with you from the perspective of entrepreneurship. Let me set this question
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.520]   up, though. I've had a similar experience. I've worked when I was a kid. I worked a lot of hourly
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.760]   jobs and some salary jobs. But my first year out of college, I got a job making, I think I started
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.200]   at $38,000. They gave me a raise to $45,000. When they gave me the raise, it was a good raise,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.400]   but I was just sitting there saying, "$45,000? My goal is to be making $100,000 in two years.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.440]   How on earth am I going to get from $45,000 to $100,000?" I realized that this world of
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.200]   salaried work isn't going to get me there. So I determined to become an entrepreneur. I went
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:48.080]   into commission sales. Since that time, I've had full control over my schedule since that first
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   year out of college. I've told my wife, I said, "Listen, we're not giving this up. I'd rather go
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.560]   and have a hot dog truck or a barbecue truck and do that and still be able to retain control of my
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.080]   lifestyle versus go and have a job where I have to deal with these certain things." So I agree
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:15.280]   with you. However, I have a good amount of self-confidence. I don't know whether I should
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.800]   tell other people that they should do what I've done because they can do it too or whether I
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.480]   should discourage them because I know that I have more confidence than the average person
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.040]   and I have quite a few skills. So here's my question. Do you think everybody should follow
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.200]   that path of entrepreneurship? >> Well, I'll take a rabbi position
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   and ask you a question. >> Deal.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.920]   >> Why are you self-confident? >>
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:46.240]   That's a good question. No one's ever asked me before. I would say probably experience. I've
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.960]   failed, I've succeeded, and I'm not scared of either.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   >> Because you've taken risk and seen that it can lead to success. So if somebody's not confident,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.840]   why would you advise them to just stay there, take the safe path, just don't ever get yourself in
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.640]   trouble? No. If you're ever going to experience something extraordinary, you're going to test the
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.320]   limits of what is normal. You're going to go into that area that most people would see as risk. But
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:19.760]   when we talk about risk, really risk is when you have no control. So if you and I go to Las Vegas
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.600]   and we put the deeds to our houses down on a roll of the dice, that's risky because we can't control
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.520]   it. But that's not what entrepreneurs do. That's not what smart people do. That's not what
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   self-confident people do. They create a clear plan of action and then walk that out.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   So my question is, I mean, there's always going to be people that work in jobs. I'm not saying
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.640]   that's not a good choice, but you ought to look at the whole spectrum of what the opportunities
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.520]   are and then choose what fits you best. But there are a lot of people who feel trapped in jobs
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.960]   unrealistically when the opportunities are there readily for them. They just aren't confident
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:04.480]   enough. And sometimes they aren't willing to have the possibility of failure. And if you don't have
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.840]   the possibility of failure, you'll never experience really big success. You'll stay in that land of
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.440]   mediocrity. And a lot of people just choose to live there. Again, that's fine. That's not where
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:24.560]   I want to be. I would rather have the risk of absolutely burning my behind, but also the
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:31.920]   possibility of just explosive success than to have a guarantee. I mean, if you ask me to wash your car
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:39.760]   and you tell me, you know, you'll give me $5 for that, you'll guarantee me $5 for that, or $8
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.120]   if I really please you. But if I take that option, if I don't please you well, you only pay me $2.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.520]   You know what I'm going to choose every single time. I'll risk only getting $2,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.120]   but with the possibility of getting $8 over the guarantee of getting $5 every time.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.960]   - I learned that lesson in college. My freshman year of college, I paid my way through school
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.160]   and I had gotten some scholarships, but not enough. And so my freshman year, I was determined
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   not to borrow money for school. And I wound up working three jobs concurrently, one of which was
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.160]   riding one of these bicycle taxis around a place in West Palm Beach. It's our city center. It's
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.800]   called City Place, one of these fancy outdoor mall type places. And I would ride the bicycle taxi
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.240]   around. And what I decided to do was not to charge people, because if you charge people,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.120]   then they're less likely to get into your bike taxi. And I looked around and I just see,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.480]   somebody's walking by on a whim. You know they have the money where they could get in the bike
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.520]   taxi, but they don't want to. And you say, "How much?" And you say, "Oh, where do you want to go?
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.000]   Okay, it's going to be $8." And they have a reason to say no. So what I chose to do was I just said,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.160]   "There's no charge. It's just tips only. You pay me what you think the ride is worth." And I tried
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.920]   to lower the fear of them getting in, in the sense of make it an easy entrance. And I never had
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.360]   anybody stiff me, but once they were in my bike taxi, I had the opportunity to do a really good
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.880]   job. I had the opportunity to engage with them, cause them to like me. I had the opportunity to
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.760]   do that. And I got more $20 tips and I'm convinced it was by far the more financially productive way
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:18.400]   to do it. Cause you get the $20 tip instead of the $4 ride. And when someone's paying you
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.440]   a specific set price, it doesn't create a sense of obligation. They feel like they've satisfied
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   their obligation. But if you can offer them a free ride, and I was totally fine. I never was
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.560]   mad at somebody when they didn't pay. I think I had a few people that probably didn't pay. I'm
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.360]   happy to do it. Otherwise I'm just going to be standing here waiting on a ride anyway. So what
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.680]   else do I have to do? But at least then I had the opportunity to earn the business and earn a much
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   higher, much higher. - Man, I love it.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.480]   - So that was my pricing. - There's a shoe shine guy in the airport
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.840]   in Dallas who does that. I love that. I try to find him every time I'm going through there
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.120]   because I love that model. He signed your shoes, does an amazing job. How much? Whatever you think
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.240]   is reasonable. And I'll guarantee that guy makes double what the dude who charges 10 bucks is
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.320]   getting. - I agree. I agree. And the thing I love is
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.480]   I've got aggressive goals and I can't imagine how depressing it would be not to be able to at least
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   see some way, some pathway to where I might be able to hit my goals. And that's the thing I love
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.000]   about entrepreneurship is having, if there's anything I want, whether it's monetary or
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.840]   nominal, I can set that as a clear goal. And then I can say, how can I earn this? How can I make
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.360]   this happen? You can't do that necessarily when you're in a salaried job. - Well, and when you
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.400]   think about the things, the space that we're in, when you think about writing, speaking, now my dad
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.160]   was a farmer. He was bivocationally pastored a tiny little church, but didn't get paid for that.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.800]   So we eked out a living as a farmer and he understood you plant soybeans, you harvest them,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.000]   take them to town, you milk the cows and sell the milk. But this thing about you get paid for
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.800]   speaking, for thinking, for writing, he never could really get his head around that. Anyway,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   what an amazing space that we're in where the profit margins are just obscene, sometimes 100%.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.280]   But in that space where we are doing those kinds of things, this intellectual property space,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.680]   especially, there are no real standards for what the value is. It's not like you're buying an icon
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.400]   camera so you can go to three different stores and they're all gonna be within $20 of each other.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.920]   No, I mean, there are attorneys, of course, that charge $40 for their services and some
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   would charge 400. Well, it's not the ones 10 times smarter, they've just positioned
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.200]   themselves differently. So when we get into this arena and you write a book, and the things that
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.280]   really get my attention are the things, what is it that I can do once and need to get paid 10,000
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:49.840]   times? Where we move from linear income into residual income, that's where it just opens the
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.240]   door to unbelievable kind of opportunities. Now, I don't expect everybody to do that. I mean,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.600]   I like to have people that come and mow my yard and wash our windows and do the things that I
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:08.400]   wanna have and build a patio for me that are more tangible. But I've just discovered this amazing
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   world in this intellectual capital space that provides opportunities that are just endless.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.480]   - Yeah, I'm doing my best to, I've been working hard on it, I'm doing my best to join you in
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.160]   enjoying the fruits of labor. I wanna ask about kids. Are your kids entrepreneurs?
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.000]   - Yes, I spoiled them totally. They would never--
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.960]   - Do you recommend that as a parenting strategy or?
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:42.720]   - Oh, well, I do because I think it opens them up to such a world of opportunity
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.360]   and lifestyle that they would never experience otherwise. I mean, I have a son who lives
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.240]   at 10,000 feet in Woodland Park, Colorado. They have a big house that they built. They have seven
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.520]   kids where the kids can ride their bicycles inside the house. He couldn't do that if he were an
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.720]   employee. He does that because he's an entrepreneur. I have a son who lives in Nosara, Costa Rica,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:13.840]   right down on the Pacific Ocean. I mean, there's hardly anybody within miles of there,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.680]   but he can do it because he's an entrepreneur. My daughter lives here fairly close to us in
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.960]   Franklin, Tennessee, but she and her husband are getting ready to buy an RV and just rent out their
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.920]   house and just travel for six months or so because they can do that as an entrepreneur.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.160]   When Ashley, our daughter, got married at that time, her husband, fresh out of college,
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.840]   had gotten a position as a banker. He was very respected and moving up quickly in managerial
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.360]   programs and all that. Well, it'd be a Thursday afternoon. He'd run home for lunch, a pretty day
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.800]   outside, and he'd say, "Well, geez, honey, I need to get back to work." And she's like, "Well,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.840]   what do you mean? Can't we go to the park?" She had never experienced the man in the house
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   being confined by the realities of a job.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.560]   What a story.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.200]   We grew up like that. My oldest son got into bicycle motocross racing. We'd leave on Thursdays
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:17.840]   a lot of time, go race somewhere, come back on Mondays. I'd do my work, but we had total
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.120]   flexibility to go to the park, travel, do the kind of things that the kids want to do. I mean,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.840]   the compromises that some people think you have to make to be an entrepreneur are totally
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:38.400]   unrealistic. Compromises in being a daddy or being a husband are so much greater in having
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.080]   that traditional job. Now, you didn't set this up to be an entrepreneurial show, but you asked me
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.000]   about raising kids. Oh my gosh. Here's another example, Joshua. My granddaughter, who you just
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.360]   met a few minutes ago, she's eight years old. She and her yaya, my wife, her grandma, just wrote a
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.960]   book together. What if it were possible is the title of the book. They had a school that just
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.320]   asked if they would come and speak about the process of writing a children's book. And Joanne
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.720]   says, sure. Well, and they came back and said, well, what is your fee to come speak to our school?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.000]   Well, Joanne would do it for nothing. I mean, she doesn't care. And I said, no, no, no, wait a
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   minute. I said, you tell them $50. So she did. She told them $50. So, and they said, oh, that's
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.720]   fine. You know, and they got that scheduled. So then we went to our granddaughter, called her
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.880]   in the phone, in the car the other night and said, you and yaya are going to speak at this school on
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:38.000]   this date and you're going to get $50 together. So half of that will be years, $25. That's her
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.840]   first speaking gig. That's fantastic. At eight years old. I called her mother right after that.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:51.280]   And I said, you know that I'm totally ruining your children to ever have a normal career path
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.520]   because we show them opportunities. When we have events here, my grandchildren set up booths here.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.680]   They sell poppy seed muffins. They sell their own artwork. They sell cards. They do all kinds
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:09.120]   of creative things because they see the connection immediately between working,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.040]   serving something well, doing something of value and getting money in return.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   Do you think it's possible for parents who aren't entrepreneurs to train their children
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:24.240]   to be entrepreneurs? Oh yeah, absolutely. There are a lot of parents who recognize
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:32.720]   the vulnerability of the traditional workplace, the volatility there. There are people who just
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.400]   south of us here, there was a Saturn plant and I had the privilege of speaking to the leaders there
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.480]   as they were closing that down. 3,200 people put out of work. A lot of those people had never had
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.840]   another job. They had always worked for General Motors their entire working career. They were
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:59.120]   terrified. What are they going to do? Well, what a horrible position to be in to feel that vulnerable
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.280]   that a company that has been giving you a paycheck, a reasonable trade-off, you agreed to
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.920]   work for them. They gave you a paycheck. If that relationship comes to an end, don't fall to company
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.160]   if things happen and they do things change, but you ought to be so clear in what your marketable
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.880]   skills are that you can go somewhere else. Well, a lot of parents realize, they walk in to a place
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.800]   where they've been for 23 years and then they're told you have an hour to clean out your desk. We
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:30.480]   don't need you anymore. What they thought was security was nothing but an illusion. It wasn't
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.160]   security. Security is your ability to produce, to understand clearly what value you have to deliver.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.440]   And aside from that, you're very vulnerable. And a lot of parents are saying, please don't set
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.320]   yourself up for the same kind of path that I chose. That's what happened to me. That job,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:52.400]   I said the one year salary job, I got laid off from the job and I couldn't believe it. I had just
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.480]   gotten a pay raise. I had glowing reports. I was very confident that I was doing a good job. I have
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.240]   all these ideas. And then one random afternoon, they call me in for a meeting. I didn't suspect
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.320]   a thing. And all of a sudden, about five minutes into the meeting, I realized they're laying me
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:15.520]   off. And I was like, what? And I know it's not correct, but I tell you, I certainly have that
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.880]   perception that anybody who gets laid off from a job, that it's always their fault. And I know
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.600]   that's not correct. And I, but I, cause here, cause well, maybe I just, maybe it's confirmation
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.120]   bias. I want to believe it's not correct because I got laid off and I want to believe there's
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.880]   nothing wrong with me. No, but when I was sitting there and I was just thinking, like everything
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.600]   just disappeared. Like all of my plans. Thankfully I had done good financial preparation. It didn't
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:47.520]   wipe me out. I had, you know, emergency funds I had, I was okay, but still it was just such a
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.400]   total sense of vulnerability. And I was single at the time. I had no one to support. And that's
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.920]   one of the reasons why at this point, I like, I think back on it and I don't want to be in a
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.520]   position to where I might have an unknown risk. Someone just walk in and because they're changing
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.800]   the direction of the company, which is why I was laid off. They wanted, they were removing all the
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.400]   middle tier and, and had decided to change the whole, the whole structure. I don't want to be
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.160]   subject to their whims. I'd rather have a hundred customers and have, you know, five of them be
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.000]   angry with me so I can know, okay, I know, I know I'm losing those five. And you have a little bit
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.800]   of a little bit of preview. But it, it, it, it rocked me emotionally. And do you see in the
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   future? I think in the future, more and more work is going to be freelance entrepreneur,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.120]   micro enterprise type work. Do you agree? You is that, am I right? Am I wrong?
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.800]   Totally. We we've seen such a pendulum swing as we've seen the implosion of these big,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:48.480]   major companies like, you know, Enron world commons. It's an unrealistic model to have
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.200]   that many people where you're guaranteeing them a salary. I mean, ultimately it needs to go. And
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.240]   so what we've seen is a correction, just like we see real estate correct every once in a while,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.560]   you know, banking or whatever, you know, we see corrections. Well, that's what we're seeing where
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.640]   that is an unrealistic business model. When Henry Ford started guaranteeing, paying people $5 a day
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.560]   for coming in, we saw the beginning of this assembly line work where people would do work.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:24.720]   That was repetitive, boring, repetitious, but they would do it if you guaranteed him so much a day,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.560]   that's a totally unrealistic business model. So then we have people that are making $30 an hour
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:37.120]   under that model and they're throwing a hammer down in the assembly line. So it stops for 30
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:44.880]   minutes so they can take a nap or they throw the keys to the tow truck over the fence. So it stops
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.320]   things because they're going to be paid the same, no matter what it works against everybody's best
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.560]   interest. So we're seeing a correction going back to where people are just simply paid on results.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.880]   I mean, if you came to me a hundred years ago, Joshua, and said, I want you to build me a wagon,
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:06.480]   we wouldn't have guaranteed me $15 an hour or 35,000 or your $45,000 a year. We would have
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.720]   simply said, when you deliver the wagon, it's $200. That's a true business model. So going
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:19.120]   back to that and what we're doing now is a healthy correction. We're seeing companies that are saying,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.640]   we don't really care if you come into the office or not, because here's the job we want you to do.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.840]   We're going to pay you X number of dollars when that's completed. So it frees everybody up from
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:35.520]   the artificial work environment that we've seen only in the last 150 years or so. And yeah,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.840]   I think it's healthy. So free agents, entrepreneurs, whatever you want to call them,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.000]   is a healthy move back to a more realistic work model.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.320]   So I'm going to pump you for some parental coaching. I have a two and a half year old son
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   and a seven month old daughter. And I have the virtue and the benefit of being an entrepreneur.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.600]   So I can get my work done around those schedules. And we often do. If my wife's having a tough day,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.000]   I can set aside my work. Or if it's beautiful outside, we go to the park. Or I take a book
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.440]   and go to the park. And when I'm preparing for a show for Radical Personal Finance,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.240]   I can hang out with my son while he's on the playground. But here's my question.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.160]   What are some specific strategies and tools or tactics, tips, techniques, ideas would you
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.800]   share with someone like me who desires their kids develop that entrepreneurial
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:32.240]   mentality to implement? Sure. When my oldest son, Kevin, who now hosts the Zig Ziglar podcast.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.600]   Really? Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. I used to. That was Zig Ziglar podcast was the very first
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.480]   podcast I ever listened to. Really? Yep. And it was hosted by a guy. I forget his name.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.200]   He hosted it for a long time. He was blind. And he hosted it. Blake Blake,
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.240]   Lindsay, I think something like that. But the Zig Ziglar podcast was how I found podcasting
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.280]   was based upon finding the Zig Ziglar podcast. So tell your son that he's doing a great job.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.240]   And that was what introduced me now a podcaster with an established brand that it's the Zig Ziglar
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.760]   podcast that I haven't listened to New York. I have to go start listening. Oh my. Yeah. I bought
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.880]   every tape and CD that Zig Zig sold. So I just, my theory was always just buy the whole collection
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.400]   and listen to it all. So I probably heard the audio. Can't go wrong. Well, he's interviewing
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.560]   people. He just interviewed Seth Godin. He just interviewed Michael Hyatt. But yeah, what a great
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.600]   position. But, you know, he went with me when he was a little kid to hear Zig Ziglar. Come over on
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.720]   the side of the stage, get down on one knee like he would do and talk to this little kid. And he
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:43.680]   signed a gold leaf, gold planner for my son when he was about 12 years old. Anyway, it's funny how
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:49.600]   the full circle comes around. But when Kevin was 10 years old, BMX racing, bicycle motocross racing
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.760]   became popular. Well, the kid who lived right across the street from us, his name was Jeff.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.080]   His daddy got him a bike. And I thought, hey, that's cool. And Kevin says, I want one of those
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.640]   red line bikes to race BMX. And I said, well, that's the great, you know, how much are they?
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:10.000]   Well, $400. I said, okay, how are you going to get one? Let's go down to the store. You can write a
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.960]   check. I said, well, that's not the way it works in our family. That may be the way it works in
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.320]   Jeff's family, but not ours. I said, I think that's great. Let's figure out a way to get that.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:26.720]   So I bought a motorcycle. I had an auto accessories business at the time. So I was
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   connected with all the auto dealers and they'd take things in on trade. So I bought a motorcycle
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:36.560]   from one of them. It was kind of in poor repair. Now keep in mind, Kevin was 10 years old.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.840]   We worked on that for two months, every day. We took it apart. We repaired things. We got things
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   chromed. We put it back together carefully, you know, got new leather in the seat. I put a little
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.520]   pin striping on after we hand painted everything, got it already, put it out in our yard. The very
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:59.440]   first person that came by bought it. I took all my costs out. We kept track from day one, dollar one,
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.840]   what I paid for it. Every improvement we made on, I kept track of my money that I put in as his dad.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:13.360]   I took all my money back out. We had $410 left over. I said, that's your money that you earned
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   it. What do you want to do with that? I want to go get that bike. So we did, but that bike didn't
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.840]   stay out in the front yard, you know, in the ditch over the weekend, like the neighbor's bike did.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.480]   It was in his bedroom, immaculate. He took care of it because he had skin in the game. So that's
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.880]   an example, but I've always done that with our kids. You want something? Let's figure out how
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.160]   you can get it. Absolutely. I want you to have that. Let's figure out how you can get it. So
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.240]   just showing them a connection between work and getting the things that they want. You know,
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.320]   with your son, you could have him be a guest in your podcast and pay him $10 as a guest,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.920]   and then have him three envelopes, you know, giving, saving, investing, split your money
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.200]   three ways or however you want to divide it and start showing him how quickly you can accumulate
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   in those worthy envelopes, those piles. So you can decide you give, you don't have to strain
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.160]   yourself to give because you plan in advance that you're going to give a portion of what you have.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.320]   You're going to spend, you're going to invest. Sure. But you can start teaching them very,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:26.240]   very young. Our granddaughter who you just met here wanted her own computer. What was like $250?
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.360]   Her parents did exactly the same thing. They said, okay, how are you going to get that?
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:39.520]   Well, she's one who then she and her grandma made poppy seed muffins and she made a whole bunch of
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:45.120]   them. And she set up her little stand. She dressed up like in a Victorian era and had her little
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.720]   basket. She'd work the crowd. Believe me, she'd go in and work the crowd.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.520]   She was incredibly outgoing. And so it's good sales skills that she's been learning. I was
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.320]   impressed with her.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.200]   Teach new sales skills and teach new the connection. You want a $250 computer?
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   That's fantastic. Eight years old. Let's figure out a way to get it. So she comes up with different
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.760]   things that she can do where it's not just, gee, mom and dad giving her an allowance.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.680]   No, teach him very early, the connection. And once they see that connection,
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:20.400]   they're going to recognize opportunities at every corner. They're not going to be
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.640]   vulnerable. Gee, I got a degree in English lit. Who's going to give me a job?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.120]   Right.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.280]   It just doesn't compute. They see opportunities that they can act on.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.440]   Even if nobody's hiring, the economy is bad. It doesn't matter.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.800]   Well, and the benefit of it, what I want to touch on, I'll tell you just because I think
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.880]   it's important for the audience to recognize. So you and your wife were on a conference call
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.640]   when I came in. So I was waiting in the other room and I went over and just said hello to her.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:51.200]   And unlike, she didn't act shy. She didn't turn her face and run like so many young women would
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.240]   do it. She's eight, right?
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.800]   She's eight.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:58.080]   Yeah, eight. I asked her, what are you working on? She starts showing me her pictures, tells me
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.800]   about the kids book that she's publishing. Said I had to redo this illustration for the kids book.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.920]   I asked her about her other artwork. She's showing me all her artwork. She's doing a
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.800]   sales job on me. By the time I get two minutes later, I'm ready. If she had the book printed,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.840]   I would have pulled out my wallet and bought the book. And when you compare that to the
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:24.880]   relational handicap that so many people have, so many young girls her age would have,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.680]   it's just night and day. And so these entrepreneurial activities help to build
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.200]   that healthy self-image, that self-confidence, which can be the foundation of, it's a foundation
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.960]   of job skills, of business skills, of life skills, of relationship skills. That's what helps her to
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.840]   have enough confidence in herself to wait on an appropriate husband instead of throwing herself
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.000]   at the first person. That's what allows her to have the confidence in herself to be able to
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.080]   wait for the job offer that's a fair offer or to charge what she's worth. And so, I mean,
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.760]   I can see the benefit even in a 10 minute interaction waiting in the other room.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:04.560]   - That's awesome. Well, you also described there what true pure selling is. A lot of people are
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.160]   intimidated about the idea of selling. Well, gee, I'm not a salesman, so I have to just go get a
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.440]   job. That means somebody else is responsible for selling. Well, that's a tough position because
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.760]   you have to recognize you're selling your skills every single day you show up. But pure salesmanship
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.000]   is simply sharing enthusiasm. And that's exactly what you experienced with Clara.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.960]   She believes in what she's doing. She knows she's good. She is excited about it. And her excitement
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.040]   has an impact on you very quickly when you're reaching for your wallet.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.000]   - If it were ready, I would be walking out of here with a book.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.040]   - That's great.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.240]   - You touched on financial strategies. And as we start to wind down here, I want to ask you,
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.000]   I always loved, Jim Rohn always said he teaches kids to have two bicycles, one to ride and one
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.960]   to rent. So I always loved that turn of phrase. And I've thought about how to implement that with
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.440]   my own kids. How can I teach them these ideas? And you mentioned a few, but specifically with
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.720]   money management, did you use the give, save, spend? What did you do with your kids? How did
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.200]   you teach them about handling money? - We did exactly that.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.800]   - Okay, the give, save, spend. - Yes, yeah.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   - Did you apply percentages or teach them a specific percentage that was appropriate?
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.720]   - In the early years, we just simply made those a third, third, third. So they were all equal.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Just to give them exposure to the model. Now, as they got older and wanted to adjust that,
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:41.280]   but our kids are generous, generous givers. I don't have to beg them or try to teach them the
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.840]   biblical principle of the tithe. They could care less about that because they give generously
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.920]   where there are needs. They aren't concerned about, as Joanne and I are as well, they saw us
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:02.800]   model this. I really don't care about things that the IRS would deem deductible. If a young lady is
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.480]   in an apartment, newly out of prison, trying to make a life for herself,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:15.840]   and she's really going to be in a hard spot if she doesn't pay the rent by Tuesday,
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.360]   can we pay that? Absolutely. Is that deductible? No.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.160]   - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.520]   If we really consider that we're stewards of everything that we have, which Joanne and I do,
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:34.640]   then those lines can be blurred. So it's not a legalistic kind of thing at all.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:44.560]   But money flows through you. And even when you get to a point where you aren't concerned about
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.320]   paying the mortgage or aren't concerned about having groceries on the table,
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:54.720]   it doesn't mean that we then just unplug. That goes into a whole other area that we probably
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.320]   need to spend more time on. And that's this idea of retirement. I cringe when I hear that word.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.480]   - I see on my page here, of possible questions, I said, "Tuck, I just did a show called
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.200]   'Why It's Pointless to Focus on Retiring Comfortably if You Haven't First
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.360]   Focused on Working Comfortably.'" So it's on my list. We can go as long as you want.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:20.320]   - Well, here's the deal. Here's the irony with that. Retirement implies, as soon as I get enough
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.400]   money to take care of my own needs, then I'm gonna unplug from this stupid job that I have
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.120]   and just spend the rest of the time doing what I love doing. Well, what a novel concept. I mean,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.200]   if you found out how to do what you love doing and had an economic model for doing that,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.080]   the appeal of retirement dissipates immediately. It doesn't have any appeal.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.480]   - Amen.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.600]   - That's why we have people who are in their 80s who are working, not because they have to get a
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.560]   paycheck, but because they're doing something that they know has value and they just enjoy
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.040]   doing that. And what a wonderful position to be in where, I mean, I've got some really aggressive
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:05.280]   goals for this year with things that we're launching right now. Do I need a house that's
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.440]   four times bigger than what we have? No. Do I need a car that's faster than the one I drive? No.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:19.120]   I simply enjoy the process. I enjoy the hunt. And if that taps us into resources that we can
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:25.360]   share generously with other people, I still enjoy the process of earning it as we go.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:31.040]   Not so I can hoard more and accumulate more at all. It has nothing to do with that. But to simply
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:39.200]   be a vessel. And if God has given me the ability to generate money, I think there's a stewardship
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.600]   issue that requires me to continue doing that. I don't have the option to just say, "Okay,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.080]   I'm going to stop because I have enough for myself." Ooh, that makes me cringe to think about
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:48.160]   it.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.880]   - Final question. Do you have any counsel for
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:02.480]   how to manage your focus and intensity as time goes on? So at this stage of my
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.040]   entrepreneurial journey, I'm very focused on building. This is the building stage.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.600]   And there are some little things. I really like to buy some standup paddleboards. And I've been
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.080]   waiting and waiting and waiting to buy the standup paddleboards. But it's hard for me to...
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.560]   But I look and I'm like, "When should I go? I have the money. I could go do it." But I don't
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:26.240]   want to burn my capital. That's my capital, which is the foundation of my business pursuits. And I
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.400]   don't want to be in a situation where I've consumed my capital. Do you have any wisdom for how to know
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:39.760]   when to start enjoying some of the fruits of your work with consumption items instead of focusing on
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.720]   always reinvesting and building bigger and bigger?
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:49.360]   - Yeah. And most of my ideas are pretty contrarian and pretty personal. Not that I
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.400]   mind sharing at all, but I'm not sure they're a model for other people to emulate. One of those,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.800]   and you'll find this really revolutionary probably in your financial models.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.800]   I could never convince myself that I was going to save my way to wealth. It was always,
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.760]   "How can I earn my way to wealth?" If I owed the IRS another $25,000, it wasn't like, "Oh, gee,
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.880]   if we cut out going out to eat twice a week and don't go to the movies and don't go on vacation
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.920]   this year." No, it's like, "All right, what do I need to do to make another $25,000?" That's how I
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:34.080]   always have approached it. So when do you enjoy things? From day one. I've never been one to put
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.840]   life on hold thinking that there's some kind of magic number that I get to. So where are the
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   things we enjoyed more simple? 30 years ago? Perhaps. Yeah. Were our vacations a little less
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:57.040]   expensive? Yeah, perhaps. But we never deprived ourselves, even from day one, from enjoying fully
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.720]   the things we were doing. Now, part of your question though is, when do you get finished
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.440]   with the building phase and just going into the maintaining phase where things are really rolling
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.200]   well? I've got some things in place that would continue if I disappeared for six months.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.720]   And I'm really grateful for that. I don't take that for granted. I don't take that casually,
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.640]   but I'm really grateful to have those things in place. But I am not looking for a business that
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:34.400]   simply maintains itself. I'm a terrible maintainer. I have a history of if something becomes predictable,
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.800]   even if it's very successful, I'm going to start sabotaging it because the sameness,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:47.680]   the predictability bores me very quickly. Joanne still calls me a three-year man. She knows I'm
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.520]   good for about three years and I'm going to be bringing new things in or I'll burn out.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.320]   I've got a very fluid model to my business even today, where I have seven different components,
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.080]   but that means there's a lot of moving pieces at any given time. At any given time, something's on
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.960]   the bubble. It's going to be deep sexed. It's going to be taken off, but I'm going to be adding
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.480]   something new every year when I'm making my goals. I'm going to look for what is the 15% that I've
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.760]   been doing now that I'm going to eliminate because I don't want to just keep growing broader and
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.080]   bigger. That's not my goal. I want to stay very streamlined, very entrepreneurial, but the only
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.120]   way I can bring in new exciting things is to eliminate something so I make room for it. 15%
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.080]   is going to leave. That opens the door for something 15 new. Of course, in a compounding
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.840]   world, we understand that essentially that means every four years I've got a brand new business.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:39.680]   There'll be some components that come forward, but that's the way that I operate. I'm not interested
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:46.240]   in maintaining. I'm interested in the new, unpredictable challenges that are available to us.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.480]   - Yeah, and that's what's so exciting about entrepreneurship. I think about that as far
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.080]   as the life cycle that I see of my business. The cool thing about entrepreneurship is you're never
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.600]   stuck. If you start to get bored, you can change, and it's better to do it intentionally.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:57.840]   - Totally.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   - And what's the old saw? The only way to predict the future is to create it?
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.280]   - Yes. Yes.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.600]   - So, Dan, tell us about your books. Your website is 48days.com. Tell us about
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.800]   all the products, or some of the products. You've got too many to list. Tell us about
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.760]   where people can find you and search more of your resources.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.880]   - Those products are what make it easy for me to travel and drop out of sight for weeks at a time
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.440]   because they're so predictable and just continuing. The 40 Days to the Work You Love is kind of my
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.600]   core message. We just did the 10th anniversary edition, the hardback version of that.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.560]   We're introducing a brand new seminar that goes with that. We're bringing on a thousand new
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.120]   business partners that'll help facilitate that. That's part of where my financial goals are.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.680]   For right now. But then books like No More Dreaded Mondays, Rutter of the Day, Wisdom
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:50.240]   Meets Passion. But a lot of things happening. Of course, 48days.com. 48days.net is that group of
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   now over 15,000 people who are saying, "I want to do something significant. I've got a dream I want
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.400]   to put legs on." Those people share ideas and resources readily. No cost to be involved in
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.120]   that group there, and it's a way to have other people who really help elevate your success.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.240]   That kind of use the principle there, a rising tide raises all ships. So those are some of the
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.480]   ways that people can connect. We love to encourage people any way that they can.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.280]   And also, I just mentioned your podcast. You have a great podcast, 48 Days Podcast, and it's
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.640]   really a great source of inspiration for people. Entrepreneurship can be lonely,
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.680]   and it can be tough, but it's nice to have a voice like yours there with us.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.120]   So thank you for coming on the show today.
