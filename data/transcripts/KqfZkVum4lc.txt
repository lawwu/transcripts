[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.000]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6 and the first portion of the 17th verse.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.960]   The first portion of the 17th verse in the 6th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.120]   and take the helmet of salvation.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.480]   And take the helmet of salvation.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.320]   Now those who meet here regularly will know that we are engaged at the moment in studying
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.560]   the description which the Apostle gives us in this section at the end of this great epistle
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.360]   of what he calls the great armour, the whole armour of God.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.880]   He is writing a final word to these people and he reminds them that though they are Christians,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.800]   and indeed in a sense because they are Christians, they will find themselves engaged in a mighty
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.080]   battle, in a mighty warfare.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.240]   They are confronted, he tells them, by the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.840]   They are wrestling not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.520]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   places.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.560]   And there is only one way, he says, to deal with such an enemy, and that is they must
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and they must take unto them and
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.680]   put on the whole armour of God.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.280]   Nothing else will suffice, and any Christian who does not realize that he is in such a
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   battle and that this is the only way in which to wage it is already defeated and badly defeated.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.640]   Well now we are engaged, I say, in examining the various parts and portions of this whole
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   armour of God, and we have seen that the apostle divides it up into two main groups.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   There are certain parts that are fixed to the body.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.400]   There is a girdle about the lines, and that's truth.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.720]   There's a breastplate of righteousness.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.160]   Our feet have got to be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.760]   Now there are three parts of the armour that have to be fixed to the body, so that they
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.640]   move with the body, always fixed in position.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120]   But then he comes to the second group.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.920]   And here you notice he changes his word, whereas he has been using the word "having", having
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.240]   your lines girt about, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and having your feet shod
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.300]   with the preparation of the gospel of peace, he now changes his word and says, above all,
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.080]   taking the shield of faith.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.200]   See this isn't attached to the body.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.560]   You just pick it up when the battle is about to be engaged, you take hold of your shield.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.640]   And we have considered that.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.080]   The shield, as we saw, is the shield of faith.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.480]   And now he comes on to this second portion of the armour, which is again not fixed or
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.520]   attached to the body, but which one takes up and puts on, and here he is dealing with
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   the helmet.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   So he reminds us that we are to take and to put on the helmet of salvation.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.320]   Now we needn't take any time in pointing out the importance of this particular portion.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.560]   When you look at this matter from the natural standpoint, the apostle was using undoubtedly
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.740]   the figure of a typical Roman soldier of his own day, his own time, and he noticed that
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.720]   the soldier always had this kind of helmet which he put on.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   The helmet is essential.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.800]   Every part of the body has to be protected and has to be covered.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.320]   And as this is true in the natural sense in ordinary warfare, it is equally true when
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   you come to the spiritual application.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.320]   Now I would remind you, as we look at this new piece, that that is the principle of interpretation
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   here.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   The apostle is taking up a familiar picture, something with which all people living in
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   the Roman Empire at that time were very familiar with, and he uses it.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.640]   We mustn't overpress it, we mustn't overpress the details, but he is concerned to have us
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.440]   realize that each one of these pieces represents a particular aspect of this great spiritual
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.280]   truth that he is here inculcating.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.120]   So very well, we come to look at the helmet.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:12.840]   Now the helmet as worn by the Roman soldier was a kind of cap, which was made of leather.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.400]   But this leather had been strengthened and ornamented also, as a matter of fact, with
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.680]   certain plates of metal, or bosses of metal, in order, of course, to make it stronger and
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.080]   to give it protection.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.920]   So you had your fundamental piece of leather fitted to fit the shape of the head, and then
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.400]   on this leather you put these pieces of metal, metal plates, or bosses, as it were.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.000]   And this served the dual function of ornamentation and also of protection.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.080]   And then, generally surmounting all this, there was a kind of crest or plume, again
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.920]   mainly for the purpose of ornamentation.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.240]   Well now, that was the kind of helmet which the Roman soldier wore, so that when he knew
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   the enemy was coming, he had already got on his girdle and his breastplate and his sandals.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.360]   He now rushes and takes hold of his protection in the form of his shield, and then he takes
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.960]   this cap, helmet, and puts it on, and takes hold of his sword, and he rushes into the
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   battle.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.320]   That's the kind of picture which the apostle puts before us at this point.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.600]   Well now, what's the spiritual application of this?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.360]   What in particular is the apostle putting before us by this picture of the helmet?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.160]   Well, it's obvious, isn't it, that he is here drawing attention to the head, to the
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.080]   mind, the brain, the understanding, the thinking of the Christian.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.360]   We've already dealt with the feelings and the sensibilities, the emotions, the desires,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.040]   and so on, and how the enemy tends to attack us at that point and at those various points.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:18.920]   But now we've got to direct our attention to this particular aspect, where we are engaged
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.960]   with the consideration of the mind and the understanding, this intellectual part, if
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.480]   you like, of our whole position as Christians.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.600]   Now, again, I would remind you that we mustn't make too much of these divisions and distinctions,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.960]   and yet they're here, and we must pay attention to them, because when you're dealing with
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   the heart, you're also including the mind, because we saw that the devil contempted us
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   with doubts and so on, even in that realm.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.840]   Well, then, what in particular, you may ask, is the apostle teaching us by means of this
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.360]   particular picture?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:04.800]   Well, I suggest that it's something like this, that he is concerned here not so much with
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:12.040]   our acceptance and the understanding of the faith that we've already dealt with in doing
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.400]   the breastplate of righteousness, but he is here dealing with something that is even more
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.040]   general than that.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:30.160]   Here, we are concerned not so much with our understanding of particular doctrines as with
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.440]   our whole attitude towards the faith.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.680]   Now, I say we've already dealt with the trouble about particular doctrines, justification
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.200]   by faith and so on, that's where you put on, you see, the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.600]   But now, here, we've got something that is even more general than that.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.280]   Let me put it like this.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.600]   In military terms, you can divide up the business into strategy and tactics.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.540]   What that means is, your view of the campaign as a whole, and your view of particular incidents
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.960]   and events in the campaign, well, it's a very vital distinction.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.280]   There have been some great generals and captains of war who've been experts at strategy, they
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.000]   could take a very good overall view, but they were not always so good at the particular
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.980]   local skirmishes, the tactics, and vice versa.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:35.480]   Well, now, we've spent a great deal of our time in looking at the tactics, but this morning
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:42.160]   we are engaged in looking at the whole element of the strategy.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.880]   We are looking at the whole campaign.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.320]   And the particular matter that the apostle, therefore, is suggesting is this.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.400]   That the enemy sometimes deals with us at this level, and tries, as it were, to defeat
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:10.200]   us in the whole matter of the entire battle, the whole strategy of the entire campaign.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   How does he do this?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.920]   Well, this is the matter which is dealt with so often in the scriptures, and as we've already
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.800]   seen in our hymns this morning, in our hymns.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:32.960]   It's this whole problem of weariness, or of tiredness, the kind of condition into which
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.160]   the Christian gets at times that he feels like giving up the whole thing.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.000]   Now, you see the difference between that and what I've called the tactics.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.480]   Christian people are sometimes in difficulties and in trouble about particular doctrines,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.360]   particular aspects of the faith.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.680]   There's no question of going out of the whole of Christianity, but they're just in trouble
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.800]   on these local matters, and we are told how they're put right.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.960]   But here is something bigger and, in a sense, even more serious.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.400]   It's that one tends to become weary and tired, and to feel hopeless about the whole campaign
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   itself.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.040]   Now then, this is obviously a very important matter.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.880]   Let me convey it to you like this.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:24.680]   It's the kind of problem that is dealt with in that well-known poem of Arthur Hugh Clough.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:32.080]   You remember it, "Say not the struggle nought availeth, the labour and the wounds are vain,
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.960]   the enemy faints not, nor fainteth, and as things have been, they remain."
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:45.280]   Now, the whole point of that poem is to deal with that condition, the condition in which
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.600]   a man begins to feel that the fight is in vain, the struggle nought availeth, the labour
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   and the wounds are vain.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.400]   Here's a poor fellow saying, "I've been in this campaign now a long time.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   I've been wounded.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.440]   I'm striving and struggling, but what's the point of it all?
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.720]   The enemy faints not, nor fainteth.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.400]   I'm the one who's tending to faint.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.520]   And as things have been, they remain.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.240]   Have I gained an inch of ground?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.800]   Have I done anything at all?"
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.960]   Now, that's the kind of condition, I believe, with which the apostle is dealing.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.040]   You get him putting it in writing to the Galatians in these words, "Be not weary in well-doing."
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.360]   Now, that's the state.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:37.960]   One can become weary in well-doing simply through feeling the heat and the burden of
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.800]   the day.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:48.560]   The campaign is so long drawn out, the warfare is constant, and one begins to feel utterly
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.160]   hopeless about the entire thing.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:58.760]   Now, this can afflict us in a personal sense, or it can afflict us in a more general sense.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:06.560]   It often comes to a man individually in his own personal problems and battles.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.800]   And he sometimes turns to himself and he says in those words of Rustom in Sorob and Rustom,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.160]   "For now in blood and battle was my youth, and still in blood and battle is my age, and
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.640]   I shall never end this life of blood.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.680]   Here I am, I've been fighting ever since I've become a Christian, I'm still fighting.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.960]   Is there no end to it?"
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.560]   You see, it's the devil attacking, trying to get us to feel that the whole thing is
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   vain and useless.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.760]   And one can feel the same thing about the whole condition of the church.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.160]   One looks out at the Christian church today, here's an institution that's been going for
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.640]   nearly two thousand years, but what's her position in the world today?
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.240]   Look at the church in this country, with all the confusion and the muddle and the uncertainty,
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.040]   the church counting for so little, and the devil comes and suggests to us there's nothing
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.080]   in it.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.680]   If there were, things wouldn't be like this, after two thousand years, surely.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.520]   Things are as they always have been, and there's the enemy, strong and powerful.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.200]   It's you who are weak and fainting.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.520]   Is there anything in it?
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.200]   Is there any point in going on with it?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.120]   And there are undoubtedly many people who were once attached to the Christian church,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.440]   who have gone out to the Christian church, feeling that there's nothing in it all, that
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.000]   the whole thing is just vain.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.280]   So this can come to a man, I say, about his own individual and personal problems, or it
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:42.560]   can afflict him with regard to the whole state and condition of the church.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.040]   Now perhaps the best way of looking at this is to look at it in terms of the teaching
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.120]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, because that, after all, is the classical statement of this
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   matter.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.880]   Indeed, I would put it to you that the epistle to the Hebrews is nothing in a sense but an
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.840]   extended commentary on this phrase that we are looking at together this morning.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.760]   "Take unto you the helmet of salvation."
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.800]   That's the whole message of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.600]   Now what was the matter with those people?
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.280]   Well, you see, their trouble was this.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:26.600]   Here they were, they'd been brought up in the Jews' religion, and they had heard the
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:32.040]   Christian faith, and they'd believed it, and they'd become members of the Christian
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   church.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.280]   Now, for a while, everything seemed to be all right, and they were quite happy in their
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.160]   new faith.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.280]   But the years were passing, and they found that they were persecuted.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.920]   They were persecuted by their own fellow countrymen, the Jews, who regarded them as traitors to
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.100]   their long history.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.240]   They were persecuted by Gentiles.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.880]   We read that they had been robbed of their goods.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.600]   And in addition to all of this, they had been told in the preaching and the teaching that
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.000]   the Lord would come back again and receive his own unto himself, and set up his kingdom.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.880]   But there was no sign of his coming.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.960]   And the result was that these Hebrew Christians had become utterly discouraged.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.680]   Indeed, we are told that they'd become discouraged to this point, that some of them were beginning
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.400]   to look back to their old religion.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.520]   They were wondering whether they hadn't been a little bit precipitated in leaving it so
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.920]   quickly and taking up this new belief.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.000]   That's the whole problem.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.120]   That's the background to the epistle to the Hebrews, discouraged Christians.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.000]   People were beginning to think and to wonder whether they are engaged in the right thing
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.640]   after all.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.480]   People were beginning to look back and are tending to go back.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.520]   In other words, it isn't a question of tactics here, it's a question of giving up the whole
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   campaign.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.800]   They're weary, they're tired, they're persecuted, they're tempted, everything seems to be against
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.360]   them.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.760]   And they've got into a condition in which they're utterly hopeless, and are tempted
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:18.280]   by the devil to quit, to give it all up, to back out of the whole campaign and to return
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.600]   to their former position.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.680]   Now there it is, that's the classical illustration of it.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.080]   You've got another illustration of it in the third chapter of the second epistle of Peter.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   The apostle there says, "These people come to you and they say, 'Where is the promise
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.520]   of his coming?'"
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   They say, "You Christians have said that the Lord is going to come back and conquer his
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.040]   enemies and set up his kingdom, but where is the promise of his coming?
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.120]   Everything remains as it has been since the foundation of the world.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.600]   These enemies said to the Christians, 'You've made a mistake, you've believed a lie, your
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.680]   doctrine isn't true, might as well give it up, let's let you down.'"
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.760]   Now that's exactly the condition which we are looking at here.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.160]   The enemy comes, you see, and he attacks our mind, our whole outlook in this way.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.960]   He says, "There's nothing in Christianity.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.640]   It makes wonderful offers, but what does it give you?"
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.080]   He comes and he says, "No, that evangelist that you listened to, he said, 'You've become
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.740]   a Christian, you'll never have any troubles anymore, you'll walk down the road with a
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.040]   light step, you'll be in a new world, everything will be absolutely perfect.'"
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.400]   But has it turned out to be like that?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.840]   Aren't you encompassed by trials and troubles and problems?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.360]   Aren't you finding yourself in a very weary, tiring campaign?
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.800]   Indeed, don't things seem to be worse, even than they were before you became a Christian?
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   Isn't the fight hotter?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.760]   Don't you see that you're being attacked as you've never been attacked before?
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.480]   Why, what is this Christianity of yours?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.560]   It offered you so much, what's it really given you in practice?
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.320]   Now then, there's the condition.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.200]   It's a very old condition, God's people have always been tried like this.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.540]   The classical example of it all in the Old Testament, of course, is the 73rd Psalm.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.560]   There's that good man, you see, full of troubles and trials, everything going against him,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.400]   and then he looks at the others, the irreligious, the godless.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.780]   He says, "There are no bands in their death, their eyes stand out with fatness.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.780]   Nothing goes wrong with them.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.960]   Verily," he's on the verge of saying, "I've washed my hands in vain.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.480]   I'm trying to live a godly life and to please God.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.900]   Everything goes wrong with me.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.820]   Those other people defy God in rebellion.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.680]   Look what a wonderful time they're having."
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.760]   And the temptation was to back out of it and to say, "There's nothing in it.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   I've washed my hands in vain.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.760]   I'm trying to live the righteous life to no purpose.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.760]   I might as well give up.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.000]   I might as well give in."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.960]   That's the temptation.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.320]   That's the very temptation with which the Apostle is dealing as he talks here about
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.600]   our putting on this helmet of salvation.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.440]   Well, now then, we have to be clear about this thing.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.720]   You see, what it means is this.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.520]   That the devil succeeds in persuading us to become so preoccupied with the details of
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.320]   life that we forget the whole thing.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.380]   That's one of the greatest difficulties in life.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.120]   We are so concerned about the trees that we miss the wood.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.540]   We are so immersed in the local tactics that we forget the great campaign.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.240]   The world is too much with us.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.560]   We are so aware of the heat and the burden of the day that we forget who we are.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.760]   We forget what we are destined for.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.360]   That's the condition.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.240]   And the result of all this, of course, is that we begin to feel that we cannot go on,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.960]   that it's too much, the struggle not available.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   Our wounds are all in vain and all our labor is in vain.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.840]   The devil, we feel, is too strong, he's too much for us, he's sure to defeat us.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   Now that's the position.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.040]   Our Lord deals with it, you remember, when he says that men should always pray and not
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.120]   faint.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.560]   The danger is to faint, the difficulty in life is to keep standing and not to be overwhelmed
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.440]   by all these things that come upon us from all directions and tell us, "Oh, there's
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.360]   nothing in it, let yourself go, go back into the world, have your enjoyment, drown your
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.640]   sorrows, what's the point of struggling like this, what are you getting out of it?
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.000]   Give up the whole thing."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.640]   That's the temptation.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:48.400]   And of course you see at once that it is in an entirely different category from the various
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:54.720]   detailed problems with which we've been dealing in our study of this section up until
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   this point.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:01.560]   This is something, I say, which therefore obviously merits careful treatment and an
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   entire section on its own.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.240]   Well now then, how do we deal with this?
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.600]   Well again, I say, what we've got here in just this phrase of the Apostle is something
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:22.680]   that you find dealt with extensively in many parts of the Scripture.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.120]   Let me give you just one other picture in order that this thing may be quite clear to
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   us.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.440]   This, again, was the peculiar trouble with a man like Timothy.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.720]   Timothy always had the feeling that everything was on top of him.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   How to go on, that was the question, because his old friend and teacher, the Apostle in
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.680]   prison, likely to be put to death at any moment, and all these cares and burdens and problems
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.360]   and oppositions, oh, how can one go on with it?
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.400]   And the Apostle has to write to him and say, "God hath not given us the spirit of fear,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.240]   but of power and of love and of a sound mind, discipline, helmet of salvation."
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.320]   Same thing exactly.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.080]   Now then, how is this to be dealt with?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.720]   Well the Apostle says there's only one thing to do, take hold of that helmet of salvation
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.120]   and put it on your head.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.580]   But what does it mean?
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.400]   What does salvation mean in this connection?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   And here I think it's very important that we should have the right interpretation.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.200]   And I'm particularly sorry at this point that I have to disagree with the great Charles
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   Hodge.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:37.280]   Hodge tells us that salvation here means our awareness of the fact that we are saved, that
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.500]   we are Christians.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.800]   He says it means the present enjoyment of our salvation.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.880]   That is what he says is meant by the helmet of salvation.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.840]   But I want to try to show you that that's inadequate.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.980]   I think that's included, of course it's included.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.440]   And I think it misses the real thrust at this point.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.720]   What then does it mean?
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:08.640]   Well, I'm quite satisfied myself that the selfsame Apostle Paul leads us to the right
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.200]   answer in what he says in his first epistle to the Thessalonians in chapter 5 and verse
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:22.040]   8, where you read this, "But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.480]   of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation."
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.320]   That's it, the hope of salvation.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.400]   So that I would interpret this as meaning not so much the realization of our salvation
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:45.880]   at the present time, but the hope of salvation.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.520]   Now what does that mean?
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.600]   Well it means, I think again, and you see the way to interpret Scripture is to look
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.920]   at Scripture.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   Scripture interprets Scripture.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   The same thing is taught everywhere.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.860]   Do you remember how the Apostle in writing to the Romans in chapter 13 uses expressions
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.280]   like these?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:15.320]   He says, "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:22.360]   And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep, for now,"
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.740]   he says, "is our salvation nearer than when we believed."
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.740]   That's it.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.560]   Our salvation, he says, is nearer now than when we believed.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.320]   When we believed we were back there.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   We are now here.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.160]   Our salvation is nearer.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   What is salvation?
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.240]   Well, it isn't so much something I'm enjoying at the moment, it's something to which I'm
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.600]   going, something which is coming to me.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:51.320]   Our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.120]   In other words, I'm suggesting here that what the Apostle means by salvation is the
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:03.400]   Christian hope, or what he calls elsewhere the hope of glory.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.240]   And that the protection therefore which we put upon our heads to counter this particular
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.720]   assault and attack is the hope of glory, the Christian's hope.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.200]   What is this?
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:20.900]   Well, here again is something that we can deal with by simply showing you the answers
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.280]   that are given in the Scripture itself.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:30.360]   Our Lord himself in his teaching dealt with it just at the very end of his life.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   Take for instance great chapters like the 24th of Matthew, or the same thing in the
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.080]   13th of Mark, and the same thing in the 21st chapter of Luke.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.200]   What's he doing there?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.920]   Well, you see what he's doing is this.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.400]   He's taking a preview of history.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.920]   And he warns his followers that they're going to have great trials, they've got to endure
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.040]   great tribulations, there are going to be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.160]   He says get rid of the notion that Christianity is something magical that comes in and you
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.960]   enter into a magic circle and you never get any more problems.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.680]   It isn't going to be like that, he says.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.080]   He says it's going to be a life of trial, and trouble and temptation.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.840]   He that endureth to the end, that's the man that's going to be saved, that's his picture.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.860]   And so he envisages all these problems arising.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:26.180]   He doesn't say my teaching is going to make the world better and better and better, my
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.240]   teaching is a kind of political reform, it's going to banish war, there'll be no troubles,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.480]   the nations will all embrace one another, and you'll be at the head of it all in wonderful
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.040]   bliss and enjoyment.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.280]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.840]   Well then does he give them any hope?
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.140]   Of course he does.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.720]   He says these things have got to be.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.560]   These things must happen before the end comes.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.440]   But then he tells them about the end, how when they think that everything is finished
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.480]   and hopeless and they're about to give in and give way in despair, suddenly they shall
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.280]   see the son of man coming, riding upon the clouds of heaven, king of kings, lord of lords.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   Isn't that his teaching?
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.840]   Well now that's exactly what is meant here, the helmet of salvation.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.640]   When the enemy tells you to give up and to give in, that you're hopeless, that you're
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.600]   losing, here's your answer, the hope, the hope of glory, the hope of his coming, everything
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.400]   that is contained in that kind of teaching.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.740]   Well now there it is in our Lord's own teaching.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:34.840]   But let me show it to you in the teaching of the Apostle Paul in his writing, for instance,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.480]   to the Corinthians in the first epistle.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:47.040]   "But of him," he says, "are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.640]   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.920]   That's it, redemption.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.800]   That's the meaning of salvation here.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:04.160]   You see the Christian man is already justified, made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.740]   and redemption.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:12.060]   Some people think that that word redemption coming there at the end is a kind of tautology,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060]   but it isn't.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:20.020]   He means by redemption there the ultimate, completed, final, full deliverance, the complete
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020]   thing itself.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.060]   That's the thing that we've already got in Christ by faith—salvation.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.180]   All right, let's look at another.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:37.240]   This of course is the great theme of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.820]   What is he concerned about in that great chapter on the resurrection?
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:46.300]   Well, isn't it just this?
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   He says, you know, that resurrection and the assurance that he's risen, and that we are
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.700]   going to be raised also, and that this corruptible shall put on incorruption and so on, he says
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.580]   that's the thing that keeps me going.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.420]   He puts it like this, for instance, in the 32nd verse, "If after the manner of men I
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.740]   have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it me if the dead rise not?
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.540]   Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.580]   He says, you know, I wouldn't go on with this fight were it not that I knew about that
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   which is coming.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.900]   What's the point of fighting with these beasts at Ephesus?
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:31.200]   The only thing that keeps me going in the fight, he says, is that I know that this redemption,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.100]   this salvation, this ultimate victory is coming, and it's sure.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.940]   Otherwise, he says, let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.700]   We go back, we go out of it all.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.500]   This is the one motive that keeps us going.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.380]   He's always saying this.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.700]   Listen to him saying it in the second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 4.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:56.860]   Here he is, you've seen the sixth saying, "God, who commended the light to shine out
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:02.780]   of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.300]   of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   Marvelous, wonderful.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.060]   The man who says that is a man who never has any troubles, obviously.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.380]   He's seen the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:28.100]   But listen, immediately he adds, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.500]   the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us."
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:37.380]   And then that means this, you see, we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:44.500]   We are perplexed, but not in despair, persecuted, but not forsaken, cast down, but not destroyed,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.620]   always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.900]   might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.260]   So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.580]   We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, "I believed and therefore
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:04.820]   have I spoken," we also believe and therefore speak, knowing, this is the secret, that he
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.300]   which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   with you.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.700]   That's the only way to do it, he says.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:18.060]   And for this cause we faint not, were it not for this we would faint.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.420]   The fight would get us down, we'd give up, we'd give in, but for this cause we faint
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.420]   not.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   Though our outward men perish, the inward men is being renewed day by day.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.820]   And then this mighty word at the end, "For our light affliction which is but for a moment,"
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:41.060]   that's the light affliction, all those things that are happening to him, trials, troubles,
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.020]   tribulations, our light affliction, yes he can say it's only for a moment, he sees beyond
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:52.620]   it, "worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.940]   at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.420]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.900]   Put on the helmet of salvation, the hope, the blessed hope, keep your eye on that, set
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.100]   your affections and things above, it's always the same teaching."
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.980]   Now these are but variants of this command that we are looking at together this morning.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.620]   But this teaching is not confined to the Apostle Paul.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:25.580]   As I've already hinted, it's the great theme of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:31.980]   Did you notice it in the reading at the beginning in chapter 6, in verses 11 and 12, "We desire,"
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:41.220]   says this man, "that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:48.300]   hope to the end, that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who, through faith and
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.420]   patience, inherit the promises."
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.420]   What does he mean?
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.900]   What he means is this, he's already said to them, "Beloved, we are persuaded better things
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.660]   of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.300]   He's been talking about the people who deny the faith, having once said that they believed
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   it.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.380]   The terrible passage at the beginning of the sixth chapter, he says, "Beloved, I'm persuaded
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.380]   that this isn't true of you."
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.380]   Why?
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.380]   "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.620]   toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:29.620]   Now then, he says, "Put the same diligence as you put into that work of ministering to
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:35.860]   the saints, put the same diligence into making sure of this full assurance of hope unto the
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.860]   end."
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.900]   Don't listen to the devil, in other words.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.380]   Use the same energy that you do in practical matters in this matter of fighting the enemy
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.260]   when he tries to discourage you.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:52.620]   And then he goes on, you see, to that great statement about God having pledged himself
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:59.820]   with an oath, so that by two immutable things, we might have a strong consolation who have
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:05.180]   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:10.540]   And we've got an anchor even within the veil, Jesus the forerunner has gone there for us.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.060]   Hold on to that, he says.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.540]   Put the diligence into that.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.380]   Now, that's another way of putting on the helmet of salvation.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:27.380]   Indeed, it's something that he teaches us right through the whole of that great epistle.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:33.380]   He's already said this in the second chapter in verse five, "For not unto the angels hath
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.220]   he put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.060]   He says, "What are the angels?
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:45.820]   They are but ministering spirits; send forth a minister to them, who shall be heirs of
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.820]   salvation."
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.740]   That's it, always the same.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.660]   And so, this world to come is not being prepared for angels, it's being prepared for us, those
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.500]   who believe in Christ.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.740]   And on he goes with his same exhortation.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.020]   Chapter four, you remember, he uses likeness.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.980]   He says, "Don't be like those children of Israel.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.500]   They got discouraged in the wilderness.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.780]   They listened to the devil, who told them, 'You'll never arrive in the land of promise,
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.160]   the land of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.060]   You might as well turn against God now.'
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.740]   So they rebelled in the wilderness, and they never entered in.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.460]   Don't be like that, he says.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.700]   Hold on to the hope, hold on to the salvation that's coming."
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.900]   You see, it's his great message.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.460]   But listen to Peter saying the same thing, "But the God of all grace," he says in the
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.300]   first epistle, chapter five, verse ten, "But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:53.060]   his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.780]   steadily strengthen, settle you."
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.780]   That's it.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.060]   It's always the same.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:04.820]   John says the same thing, "He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   he is pure.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.140]   Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.220]   We know not yet what we shall be, but we do know that when he appears we shall see him
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.660]   as he is, and we shall be like him.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.500]   Every man that hath this hope," that's it, hope of salvation, helmet of salvation.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.820]   It's the whole teaching everywhere.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:30.780]   And for me to conclude this bit of purely scriptural exposition, it is the one message
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:37.660]   of the last book of the Bible, that is the only message of the book of Revelation.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.780]   The book of Revelation was written, the vision was given to John in order that he might prepare
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:47.580]   the Christians of that time and the Christians of every subsequent age for the kind of treatment
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.860]   they must expect in this world.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:56.100]   The beasts will arise, military power, political power, false power in the church.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.940]   They'll attack the saints and the saints will all must be exterminated, it's all right.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   He's coming, the rider on the white horse, with a sword in his mouth, conquering and
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.980]   to conquer.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.580]   That's the whole message of the book.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:19.780]   It's a book that was designed, I say, to give God's people comfort, to enable them to repulse
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:24.260]   the enemy when he attacks them in the realm of the mind about the whole campaign.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.220]   We're not dealing with particular doctrines here.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.500]   It's the whole of Christianity that's involved.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.900]   And this is the only way in which we can succeed.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.300]   So as I conclude, let me put it to you like this.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.620]   Nothing is more important for us than for us to learn what we may call the tenses of
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.860]   salvation, the tenses.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.740]   People may say to me, "Aren't you trying to tell us now then that a man can never know
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.380]   that he's saved, you're representing salvation as something entirely in the future."
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:02.260]   My dear friend, there are tenses in salvation, past, present, future.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.820]   The Christian is a man who has been saved, that's justification by faith.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:13.100]   He is no longer under the law, we saw that under the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.860]   The Christian is already saved in the sense that he'll never come to condemnation.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.100]   He's delivered from the law, he's delivered from the dominion of Satan, he's already free
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.500]   in that sense.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.940]   He has been saved.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.860]   But then the Christian is a man who is being saved.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.980]   He is not perfect.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.620]   There is work going on in him.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.500]   The present tense of salvation is this continuous process.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.620]   But then there's a future to salvation.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.100]   There is a day coming when the Christian shall be absolutely perfect.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.740]   Now then, you bear that in mind, you see the meaning of this word salvation.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:58.900]   Obviously in this connection it means the hope of salvation.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:06.860]   So you can put the tenses like this, the past is justification, the present is sanctification,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.380]   the future is glorification.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:16.100]   Redemption, glorification, the ultimate, the final, the absolute.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.460]   What does he mean then by putting on the helmet of salvation?
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.220]   It means this, get this idea clearly into your mind.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:27.300]   Here you are, attacked, besieged, tried, tempted, everything against you, and the devil says
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.940]   there's nothing in it, you might as well go out of it.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.060]   Christianity makes false promises, it doesn't fulfill them, give up, answer him by saying
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.540]   no, no, I've never been led astray by this teaching.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.940]   I've always known that there are steps and stages in salvation.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.660]   I know that I am saved, I know that I'm being saved, I know that I shall be ultimately completely
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.900]   saved.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.900]   That's the answer.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:41:01.660]   In other words, we've got to realize what this hope actually means.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.260]   And there is no difficulty about our doing that.
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.180]   This apostle has already told us what that is in the fifth chapter of this epistle to
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.180]   the Ephesians.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.980]   He says here, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:24.100]   himself for it, that," here's the object, "that he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:30.940]   the washing of water by the word, to this end, that he might present it to himself a
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:39.180]   glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it shall be holy
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.260]   and without blemish."
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.260]   That's the ultimate.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.260]   That's what he means by salvation.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.040]   We are going to be like that.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.440]   We are going to be absolutely perfect, free from sin, free from all vestiges of evil,
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.080]   without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.480]   We shall be glorified.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.960]   We shall be like Christ.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.160]   We shall see him as he is and be like him.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.400]   Our bodies shall be changed.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:11.240]   We'll be completely glorified, saved entirely, body, soul, and spirit, with nothing lacking.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.200]   That's the hope.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.560]   And putting on the helmet of salvation means realizing that that is coming.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:25.480]   Secondly, it means this, that we are certainly assured that that is going to happen to us
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.800]   individually.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:36.900]   The knowledge that we are predestined to that, "Moreover, whom he predestinated, them he
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:43.020]   also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and them whom he justified,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:49.880]   he hath also glorified," knowing that you are involved in that, knowing that you are
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.320]   no longer in the world, knowing that you have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ,
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.960]   and that having been justified, you can rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   It means that.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:11.640]   And thirdly, it means this, that he having ever set his love and his affection upon us
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:20.280]   and ever having called us, will never let us go.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:26.160]   That whatever the strength and the power of the enemy, his power is greater.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.640]   Listen to our Lord saying it in John 10, 28, 29, "And I give unto them eternal life, and
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.120]   they shall never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.840]   My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.520]   of my Father's hand."
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.980]   That's it, helmet of salvation.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.560]   No man shall ever be able to pluck us out of his hand, the hand of the Son, the hand
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   of the Father.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.120]   He'll keep us.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.640]   Or listen to Paul saying it, "What shall we then say to these things?
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.600]   If God be for us, who can be against us?"
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.640]   That's the helmet of salvation.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.700]   When you see the enemy coming in droves and all his power and might, put on your helmet
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.700]   of salvation.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.720]   "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.320]   You've already defeated him.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:28.240]   "For I am persuaded that though we are led as sheep to the slaughter day after day and
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.580]   everything's against us, I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.960]   nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.480]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.560]   Let the enemy do his worst, he'll never separate us."
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:56.000]   That's the helmet of salvation, the certain hope.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.880]   In other words, you see, it all comes to this, doesn't it?
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:08.760]   Look at our blessed Lord himself, Son of God, here incarnate in this sinful, evil world
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   with the devil attacking and all the powers of hell let loose against him.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.400]   He went through with it, he knew what it would mean, he knew the cross and the separation
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.520]   from the Father, but he went on.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.680]   What enabled him to do it?
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:32.880]   Here's the answer given in Hebrews 12, 2, "Oh, for the joy that was set before him endured
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:39.560]   the cross, despising the shame, the joy that was set before him."
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.840]   That was the secret.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:48.280]   He kept his eye on that and therefore he was able to conquer his enemies for the joy that
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:56.820]   was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:02.160]   Very well, let's look unto Jesus, let's follow his example as the enemy comes and attacks
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.000]   the mind and the understanding in this way, let's answer him, the hope, the certainty
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.280]   of it, the glory of it, and that we're in his power and that he'll never leave us nor
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.240]   forsake us.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.440]   So you see the writers of our hymns have been quite right.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:24.200]   They've got hold of it, they've put it like this, "Mid toil and tribulation and tumult
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:33.560]   of her war," this is the church, "she waits the consummation of peace forevermore, till
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:41.120]   with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blessed, and the great church victorious
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.080]   shall be the church at rest."
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.760]   Listen to another putting it, he exhorts us, "Stand up," he says, "Stand up for Jesus,
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:58.680]   the strife will not be long, this day the noise of battle," and it's awful, isn't it?
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   He's attacking us individually, he's attacking the whole church, communism and otherisms
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.560]   seem to be defeating Christianity, is it all in vain, might we as well quit and give up?
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.040]   "Stand up for Jesus, the strife will not be long, this day the noise of battle," the next,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:17.880]   the victor's song, "to him that overcometh a crown of life shall be, he with the king
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.560]   of glory shall reign eternally."
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   Then let's come and be a little more subjective, Christian, just now hear them, how they speak
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:38.680]   within, always fast and vigil, always watch and prayer, Christian, answer boldly, "While
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:47.840]   I breathe, I pray, peace shall follow battle, night shall end in day."
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.880]   "Well, I know thy trouble," says our blessed Saviour to you, hard-pressed Christian this
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:48:02.800]   morning, "Well, I know thy trouble, O my servant, true, thou art very weary, I was weary too.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.760]   I've been in that old world of yours, I've had to fight against it all in a way that
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:16.600]   you'll never know, I was weary too, but that toil shall make thee someday all mine own,
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:25.280]   and the end of sorrow shall be near my throne, put on the helmet of salvation, let me end
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:37.600]   with John Bunyan, hobgoblin or foul fiend, can ne'er daunt his spirit, he knows he at
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:49.200]   the end shall life inherit, then fancies fly away, he'll fear not what men say, he'll labor
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:57.520]   night and day to be a pilgrim, he's seen it, he's got the hope, he knows about this ultimate
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.880]   redemption, this final glorification, this completed salvation, he knows it, he's put
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.760]   on the helmet of salvation, hobgoblin or foul fiend, let them come, let all the forces of
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:16.240]   the enemy attack together, it doesn't matter, can never daunt his spirit, he knows he at
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:22.320]   the end shall life inherit."
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:29.160]   Now my friends, that's the only way in which this battle can be fought.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.000]   Has he tempted you to give up?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.120]   Has he tempted you to give up the church and your Christian profession and join the world
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.760]   and its supposed pleasures?
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:48.080]   Can't you see the subtlety of it all, but can't you see the folly of listening to him?
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   We've never been offered an easy time in this world, Christianity is too honest to do that,
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:00.200]   it's the politicians who offer that kind of thing and the philosophers, Christ has warned
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:06.720]   us "He that endureth to the end shall be saved, there shall be wars and rumors of wars, everything
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:13.600]   will be against you, you'll think you're finally lost and defeated, lift up your heads."
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:27.360]   The coming of the Son of Man draweth nigh, put on the helmet of salvation, Amen.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
