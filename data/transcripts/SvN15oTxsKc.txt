[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, how did God bring me to himself?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   How did he call you to himself?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And what happened in that sovereign act of his?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's a question Pastor John addressed in a 2010 sermon on 1 Corinthians
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   chapter 1, verses 26-31, and it's a clip sent in to us from a listener
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   named Sue, who never forgot it. She loves this clip. She wanted to share
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   it with us. It's a good one. Here now is Pastor John.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Both Jews and Greeks, Christ
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   the power of God and the wisdom of God. So when the called
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   look at Christ crucified, they don't see stumbling block. They don't
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   see folly. They see power. So there are three
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   groups, right? Three groups in those verses. Number one, Jews. Number two,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Gentiles. Number three, called. That's not quite accurate, is it? Let me say
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   it a little more carefully. There are Jews who are not
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   called, Gentiles who are not called, and Jews
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   and Gentiles who are called. Those are the three groups.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Are you with me? We're considering our calling. We're obeying
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   verse 26. There are Jews
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   not called, Gentiles not called, Jews and Gentiles,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   some of whom are called. And then he describes the response
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   of each to the cross. Jews, yeah, stumbling block.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Crucified Messiah, never heard of such a thing. Gentiles, foolishness.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   A dying God, silly, mythological. Called, power,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   my God. What kind of call is that?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'll tell you what kind of call it is.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's the kind of call that creates what it commands.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The call gives light.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The call creates sight.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   The call raises the dead.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Lazarus, come forth. He didn't
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   decide to. The call raised him from the dead.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Let me give you an analogy that could be misleading. It helps me.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Just to get your handle on it, because lots of you have never been
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   taught about the call of God. The mighty, effectual, irresistible,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   powerful, saving, awakening, life-giving call of God
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   that saved you. You've never been taught about this. So you need a little
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   analogy to help you. What is he talking about? I've never heard
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   anything like this. I thought I just believed in Jesus.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Suppose somebody is asleep and you want
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to wake them up. What do you do?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well, you bend over. They're sound asleep. You bend over them and you say,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   "Wake up!"
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And they bolt right upright.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, what are the dynamics of that moment?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   They were sound asleep and bang, they were awake.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Did they hear the call and say, "I'll think about
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   that before I wake up. And then I'll
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   decide if I want to wake up."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   This is a good analogy. When God issues
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   a call to your dead heart and says, "Wake up!"
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You wake up. You did not make yourself a Christian. Just face it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You didn't make yourself a Christian, which is why you should feel
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   so incredibly loved. In fact, if you need a text to say that,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   just go to Ephesians 2, verse 4, where Paul
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   says just as clearly as can be, "Because of his great
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   love," it's the only place he uses that phrase in all the New Testament, "Because of his
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   great love, he made you alive when you were
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   dead." So if you have any spiritual life in you at all,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   you have been greatly loved. It's called regeneration.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's called calling. You have been
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   called and you are greatly loved in this
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   calling. God loved you by putting you in
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Christ. Verse 30,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "And because of him you are
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   in Christ Jesus."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's pretty clear. In the original, very, very literally,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   it would go, "From him are
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   you in Christ Jesus." Or, "Of him are you
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   in Christ Jesus." "Because" is probably a pretty good translation.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "Because of his doing, because of his work, you are
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in Christ Jesus." So he chose you
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   before the foundation of the world. He, through Billy Graham
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   or a preacher or your mom's testimony or reading the Bible or hearing a
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   worship song or however he wanted to do it as far as human agency goes, he
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   spoke the word, "Wake up!" or, "Come!" or,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   "Live!" And you suddenly stopped seeing
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the cross as folly. You stopped seeing the cross as
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   boring. You stopped seeing the cross as mythological.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   You stopped seeing the cross as a stumbling block. And suddenly
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   it was what you needed
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and true. And you embraced it. You embraced
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   it. Because God woke you up,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   changed your heart. And when in that
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   time you were united
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   to Christ. Back in when we were talking about
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   the doctrine of regeneration or
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   the new birth, I tried to explain how
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   calling, regeneration,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   faith, union with Christ are simultaneous.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   There are causal connections here, but there aren't
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   temporal gaps. In an instant,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   in an instant, he wakened you from the dead.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Your eyes now went, "Tch!" And what you saw was a glorious
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Christ. And in seeing him as
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   glorious, you were a believer. You were. That's what
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   believer means. He's glorious. He's Savior. He's Lord. He's
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   mine. That's what it is to see him for what he really is.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And in that moment, you were united to Jesus. Which means
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   God loved you by making
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Christ your wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and redemption. Verse 30, "And because
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   of him you are in Christ Jesus." So God awakened you,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   united you to Christ so that you have a vital union
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   with Jesus. You're connected with him maybe like a vine and a branch.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Who, that is Christ, became
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   to us, are you with me in verse 30? Who became
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   to us wisdom from God,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   righteousness, and sanctification, and
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   redemption. So when you
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   unite with Christ, all that he is now,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you are without making you God.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   All the benefits that are in him, all the inheritance that is in him, all that
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   he ever purchased, all the obedience he ever performed,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   all the forgiveness he ever purchased, you now have by virtue of
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   union with him which you feel by faith and God worked sovereignly.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He has become through God's
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   loving you this way, everything for you. Which is why when I walked in
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   tonight and heard the worship team rehearsing,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I said, "Hallelujah, all I have is Christ."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I said to Chuck, "Okay, I'm doing an audible here. I had a hymn picked out for the end.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Bang, we're going to do that." All I have is Christ,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   verse 30, right? If I need wisdom, he's my wisdom.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   If I need righteousness, he's my righteousness. If I need sanctification,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   redemption, you are loved, Bethlehem.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   You are loved, sons and daughters of God, because
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   God chose you for himself.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Secondly, you are loved because he called you to
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   himself. Number three, you are loved
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   because he united you to Christ.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And four, by making you one with Christ,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Christ becomes everything you need.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's a sermon clip from Pastor John's sermon, "Consider Your Calling,"
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   preached on April 25, 2010 at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and sent to us by a listener named Sue, who says, "My husband and I had the privilege of
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   attending Bethlehem Baptist Church from 2002 to 2015
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   when we lived in Minneapolis. We now live in North Carolina."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Thank you, Sue, for the clip. I suspect you first heard it live, and
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I appreciate you sending it in. No matter how you find them, send us your
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   favorite sermon clips of Pastor John. Give me the title of the sermon and the time stamp
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   from the audio of when the clip begins and ends. Tell me why it's impacted you. Give me your
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   name, closest city, and email me all those details.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. Put the word "clip" in the subject line, please, if you would.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And who knows, maybe we can share it here on the podcast.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Next up, how do we raise kids in this world who are not naive and who are not
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   cynical? Not naive, not cynical. It's a fantastic
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   charity question from a dad, a listener to the podcast named Rick in Fort Worth, Texas. That's up next
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   time on Friday. I'm Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   [end]
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   [music]
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Thank you.
