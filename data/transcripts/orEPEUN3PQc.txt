[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340]   the Citi Custom Cash card.
[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.600]   On the surface, this card looks amazing
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140]   because you get 5% back on whatever category
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.600]   you spend the most in.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.520]   And the categories are really wide ranging.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.980]   Restaurants, gas, grocery, travel, transit,
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.060]   streaming, drugstores, home improvement,
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.000]   fitness clubs, and live entertainment.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   And home improvement is probably the most notable one
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.680]   in here for me because I'm not aware of any other card
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.700]   that has a elevated earnings potential for that category.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.780]   However, you're capped at only earning that 5% back
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.040]   on up to $500 per billing cycle,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.440]   which means that you're only getting it on $6,000 a year.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.180]   And so if you look at earning 5% on $6,000
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.460]   or earning 5% on a 2X Unlimited card,
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.580]   you're just getting a bonus of 3%.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.120]   And so that's really just a max of $180 a year.
