[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   This is Psalm 1 from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.600]   How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.040]   way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.000]   But his delight is in the law of Yahweh, and in his law he meditates day and night.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.640]   And he will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.720]   in its season, and its leaf does not wither, and in whatever he does he prospers.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.600]   The wicked are not so, but they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920]   Therefore the wicked will not rise in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.600]   of the righteous.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.080]   For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
