[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Are you someone that believes that we'll see AGI in our lifetime? Do you think the singularity is
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   coming? I don't know about that. However, if we reframe the problem, if we reframe the question
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.320]   just slightly and say, "Will AI be able to do things that are much, much better than humans can?"
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.680]   You and I both know that, in fact, if you reframe the question that way, AI in many,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.600]   many fields are already superhuman. I think the number of superhuman skills
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:46.640]   that AI will learn over the course of the next decade is quite extraordinary.
