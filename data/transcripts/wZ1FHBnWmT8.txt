[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, we talk a lot about joy in God in this podcast.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   We love talking about joy in God.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.200]   It's at the very core, at the very heart of what we do at Desiring God.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000]   So it raises the question, how closely connected is the full experience of our joy in God to
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.800]   the charisma, the gifts of the spirit outlined by Paul in the epistles of the New Testament?
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.040]   Like in 1 Corinthians 14, for example, where he talks about the gifts of tongues and of
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   prophecy.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.800]   It's a question from a listener named Matthew.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.600]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.360]   I appreciate Tony's continued invitation for listeners to send in questions that get to
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.600]   the very foundations of what this podcast represents.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   Amen.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   Keep them coming.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   So here's mine.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.280]   How essential is continuationist theology for experiencing the fullest expression of Christian
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.520]   hedonism?
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   In other words, if I am a cessationist, will my joy be incomplete?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.760]   Let's begin with three definitions so that we know what we're talking about.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.360]   First, I assume that when Matthew asks about continuationist theology, he's referring to
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.520]   the view that the spiritual gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 to 14 are still available
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.600]   and operative in some measure today.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.960]   Second, I assume he means by cessationism the view that the extraordinary supernatural
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.560]   gifts like speaking in tongues, prophecy, healing, discerning of spirits, and so on,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.080]   are no longer given by the spirit and should not be pursued today.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.680]   That's cessationism.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.440]   And third, by Christian hedonism, I take him to mean my view that God is most glorified
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.920]   in us when we are most satisfied in him, and that therefore it is our duty to pursue maximum
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.680]   satisfaction in God so that he might be maximally glorified in us.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.960]   Those are my three definitions.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:15.000]   And the question that is being asked is whether the denial of the presence of spiritual gifts
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.320]   will limit the goal of Christian hedonism, namely the maximum joy in God for the sake
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.600]   of maximum glorification of God, and two, to put it positively, would the pursuit of
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   spiritual gifts enlarge the outcome of our pursuit of joy in God for the sake of his
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.400]   glory?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   Now there are several things that I need to clarify here before I give a specific answer
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.680]   to that question.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:54.400]   The first important clarification to give is that any given cessationist may have greater
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.480]   joy in God than any given continuationist, and vice versa.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.940]   In other words, nothing in continuationism guarantees that the Christ-exalting joy of
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.000]   every continuationist will be greater than the Christ-exalting joy of every cessationist.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's not true.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   There are too many other factors involved to make that judgment.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.120]   That's the first thing that really needs to be kept in mind.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.480]   Here's the second one.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.320]   Spiritual gifts are only spiritual in the fullest biblical senseâ€”that is, made holy
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   and beautiful and Christ-exalting by the shaping power of the Holy Spirit in them.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.880]   They are only spiritual in that fullest biblical sense when the Holy Spirit makes them so,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:55.280]   which means that in and of themselves they may not be a sign that a person is spiritual
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.240]   or even born again.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   Now I know that sounds strange to some people, that an unregenerate, unchristian person could
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.480]   speak in tongues or perform healing, but that's true.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   The devil himself is going to produce deceptive signs and wonders at the close of the age
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.520]   (2 Thessalonians 2:9), and Paul says amazingly in the first three verses of 1 Corinthians
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.320]   13 that we can speak in tongues, we can have all knowledge of mysteries, we can move mountains.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   And yet if we don't have love, the premier grace of the Holy Spirit, if we don't have
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.800]   love, we're a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal, and we morally, spiritually amount to nothing,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   he says.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   That's damning for those who have spiritual gifts, but don't have love.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.620]   In other words, speaking in tongues, prophesying, moving mountains may not be spiritual in that
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.560]   fullest sense.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.840]   And what this means is that spiritual gifts are, in an important sense, like other natural
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   gifts, like food, sunsets, friends, children, music.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:26.400]   All of those things can become means by which we know God and taste God more fully and thus
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.720]   enjoy him more fully and glorify him more fully, or they can become replacements for
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.400]   God and actually detract us from the enjoyment of God himself.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.340]   That's true for natural gifts in nature.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's true for spiritual gifts that are not infused by the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.520]   So with those clarifications, my answer to the question is, all other things being equal,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.400]   a person who pursues spiritual gifts can experience the goal of Christian hedonism more fully
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.320]   than a person who doesn't.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   All other things being equal.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:21.320]   That's because God has given spiritual gifts as a means of ministry to his people, and
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.200]   these gifts are points of supernatural encounter with the living God in which he shows more
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.360]   of his power, more of his wisdom, more of his love to his people, and whenever God is
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   showing more of himself, there is the possibility of our having more joy in him and seeing more
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.520]   of him and being more deeply satisfied in him and thus glorifying him more.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:57.680]   So I think Paul's three commands to earnestly desire spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.720]   and 14 are in fact given both for the upbuilding of the body of Christ and for the increase
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   of our joy in him.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.720]   He says, "Earnestly desire the higher gifts," 1 Corinthians 12, 31.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:20.280]   He says in 14.1, "Pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.960]   you may prophesy."
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   And in 14.39, "Earnestly desire that you may prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues."
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:38.200]   So Paul is not, when he says that, he's not seeking the diminishment of our delight in
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.520]   God when he makes these commands.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.360]   He's seeking the increase of our joy in God as we see him show his power and show his
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.520]   love to his people through us.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:02.840]   So yes, I think all other things being equal, a person who pursues spiritual gifts can experience
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.280]   the goal of Christian hedonism more fully than a person who doesn't.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.720]   That's good, and worth thinking about very carefully.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.880]   Pastor John, thank you for maintaining this priority on joy and the earnest pursuit of
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.040]   the Holy Spirit over the years.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.480]   I really appreciate that.

[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.880]   Well what does the Apostle Paul mean when he says we are to judge angels in 1 Corinthians
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.960]   6 verse 3?
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.640]   It's an incredible text.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.720]   But what exactly does it mean?
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.200]   That is how we will begin the week together.
