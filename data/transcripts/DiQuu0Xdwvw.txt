[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   If I criticize you publicly, you're likely to go into fight or flight mode and then you
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.080]   physically cannot hear what I'm saying.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.160]   So once again, I'm wasting my breath.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.760]   And so don't do that.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.520]   And also use core with criticism, context, observation, result, next step.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.040]   There's a world of difference between saying, "Oh Kim, you're just too stupid to do this
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   job."
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.360]   Like that would be awful.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.560]   Maybe it's better to say, you know, something else, say, you know, you lost credibility.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.040]   In my case, that was the word that really got my attention.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   And my boss knew me well enough to know that that was the okay word to use with me, that
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   it wasn't going to crush me, but it was going to get my attention.
