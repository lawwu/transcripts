[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Will you open your Bible to Hebrews chapter 13?
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.840]   Continue to explore the theme of truth and triumph in Hebrews 13 verses 7 through 17
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.440]   is my chosen text.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.080]   Begin by reading it to you.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:41.060]   Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you, and considering the result
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.660]   of their conduct, imitate their faith.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.560]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.180]   Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.940]   be strengthened by grace, not by foods through which those who were so occupied were not
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.380]   benefited.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.660]   We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.420]   For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.740]   priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:45.340]   Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.020]   outside the gate.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:58.140]   So let us go out to him, outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.860]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.820]   Through him, then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God that is the
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.680]   fruit of lips that give thanks to his name.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.980]   And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.860]   Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.420]   will give an account.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.820]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.620]   This is the word of the living God.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.100]   Father, would you instruct your servants by word and spirit to accomplish all your purposes
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.020]   in the hearts of these brothers?
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.340]   May they be encouraged to follow Jesus more faithfully as a result of your word, even
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.940]   in this hour.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.980]   In the matchless name of Christ, amen.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.500]   The Roman Empire made the church look like a tiny speck.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.900]   In the first century, it had to be the least of Rome's concerns.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:42.140]   Visigoths, sustaining a high Greek-centered culture, competitors for Caesar's authority,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.540]   squabbling within the Senate.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.140]   Those are things that Rome was concerned about in the first century, and Christianity may
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.420]   be one of the things that the Roman Empire would deal with on their agenda and some of
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.700]   the threats it may have posed in some out-of-the-way places in the Roman Empire.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.540]   The church was, though, in perspective, tiny.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.740]   A tiny little ship on a massive sea that was Rome, and every Christian knew it.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:21.580]   Judaism was big, propertied, historic, ancient.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.900]   The Roman Empire was powerful, massive, and global.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.500]   The church was infinitesimally small.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.520]   And to this group of former Jewish members of followers of a cult that was perceived
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.780]   to be this new upspring form of Judaism that was kind of monotheistic by outside perspectives,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.220]   that was confusing to outsiders, people who followed after a crucified Messiah, claiming
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.900]   He was resurrected, and now trying to incorporate Gentiles into their mix, monotheists in a
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.620]   world of polytheism, sort of Jews, sort of not, hard to understand.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620]   It would seem quite easy to stomp out.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.260]   The church knew its place in this massive world as far as politics went.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.100]   They had nothing as far as influence went.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.560]   They had nothing as far as resources went.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.640]   The church was quite poor.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.060]   And for the recipients of the letter to the Hebrews, these believers were becoming poorer.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.820]   They were being thrown into prison, being threatened with death.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.420]   Some of their leaders had already gone from their midst to heaven.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.060]   Increasing persecution, increasing societal ostracization, the little tiny church floating
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:57.740]   on the sea of the Roman Empire receives a letter from a pastor knowing that their greatest
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:06.860]   struggle is not being squished by Rome, but that they were on a real place of spiritual
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.860]   danger.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.380]   They were on the brink of recapitulation.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.440]   They were thinking about going back to their former manner of life.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.660]   They felt their smallness, and he concludes his letter by telling them that the greatest
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.520]   threat to their existence is not Rome, and it is not the machinations of the Jewish political
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   powers.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.300]   The greatest threat to their existence is within their own community.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.360]   And so after presenting a picture, a portrait of the greatness and beauty and matchlessness
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.480]   and superiority and supremacy of Jesus Christ for 12 chapters, and showing them that God's
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:48.680]   plan from the very start was to bring through His people Israel glory to His Son, Messiah,
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.380]   and to have His Son be the substance of all the shadows that the Old Testament had within
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.960]   it, that Jesus is the culmination, the final word from God, the ultimate mediator, the
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.480]   ultimate prophet, the ultimate priest, the high priest of all that the high priest represented
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.020]   before, that Jesus is God, a very God, and His revelation is the final one and that His
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:19.680]   city is the one that will stand and all that was left for these people was to follow Him.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.480]   He tells them if they're going to receive the salvation that they had tasted, the final
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.440]   perseverance into glory, if they were going to be perfected in the end, they must not
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.640]   give up.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.720]   That the threat of apostasy was real.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   They should not quit.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   They should not walk away.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   They should finish the Christian race.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   And the great threat was not the juggernaut that was Rome and persecution, though it was
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.440]   on the increase.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.040]   The danger was within their own hearts.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   And so the epistle to the Hebrews is a call for perseverant faith, and it finds great
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.520]   focus at the end of this letter in chapter 13.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.920]   And when anyone's writing a letter to someone they love, they cram in so many important
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.400]   things they want to mention at the end, and this author, this pastor is no different.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.960]   He's spoken to them in the opening of chapter 13 about the necessity of love continuing
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.020]   and to continue to pour out their lives in hospitality to strangers and to remember those
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.900]   believers who were locked up and imprisoned and ill-treated and to sympathize with them
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.920]   and to not abandon God's plan of marriage, even in a society where their very lives were
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   in danger.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   But this was indeed the way God perpetuated the human race and preserved the truth and
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   the family.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.840]   And he talks to them about marriage and what most people take to be assorted commands.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.520]   He continues all the way through the end of the chapter with various things that sound
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:11.160]   like the epistle to Hebrews but are maybe unclear with how they're linked.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:19.840]   But I think that this final section, as the author brings his epistolary homily to a close,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:27.280]   is right in tune with exactly what we've been talking about all week long, the triumph of
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.440]   truth.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:38.800]   The triumph of truth is certain, and what truth is triumphing through in Hebrews 13:7-17
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:45.860]   is it triumphs through something seemingly unremarkable.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.960]   Truth triumphs through pastoring.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.160]   Pastoring.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.600]   That's what's being described in verse 7 and verse 17.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   Pastoring is the antidote to final apostasy, and pastoring is what will bring these people
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.740]   to final salvation.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.080]   The fruit of their worship of Christ will be evident in their lives in all the categories
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   listed in verses 1 through 6 as they receive this final portrait of their leaders and the
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:36.160]   importance of their leaders, especially as their leaders follow Jesus faithfully.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:43.040]   That seems to be what links together what William Lane sees as a chiasm in Hebrews 13
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:51.320]   or multiple chiasms as there's a verse about spiritual leaders in verse 7 and a word, a
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:59.080]   command, an imperative about spiritual leaders in verse 17, and then seemingly very epistle
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.640]   of Hebrews kind of language about the sacrifice of Christ, about legalistic teachings about
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.720]   food in verse 9, the familiar verse 8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.080]   in treaty for them to go outside of the camp in verses 12 and 13, and then a word about
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   a city that is to come and sacrifice of praise.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.320]   What is it that links all of this together?
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:38.400]   I think it's a portrait of triumph through pastoring, a passage that shows us what is
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:48.480]   our work summarized, that we teach and obey the Word of God.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:58.200]   We provide for God's flock in our teaching and with our lives a careful example of what
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   it looks like to follow Jesus no matter what the cost.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:17.400]   It's an incredible passage that challenges us and reminds us that being a pastor is not
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:26.680]   being a visionary, innovative, entrepreneurial leader, but being a pastor is someone who
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:35.080]   has the conviction and the desire and the will to follow Jesus faithfully no matter
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.160]   where he leads.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.920]   It's an incredible passage for us as men who want to humbly follow Jesus and whose role
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   is to teach the people the Word of Christ and invite the people to walk with us as we
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.200]   follow Him.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.640]   And so this tiny boat on that massive sea of opposition is so similar to where we find
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.500]   ourselves today, a world moving away from anything resembling Christian ethics, a worldview
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:14.120]   contrary to our own with lightning speed, it seems to be unraveling.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:20.720]   And here we are with our singular insistence that Jesus is the only way of salvation and
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:32.480]   that Christian ethics are non-negotiable in the face of a world that has moved on.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:41.160]   It also serves as a reminder that the greatest danger we face is not an unbelieving world
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.560]   or un-Christian ethics.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:51.360]   The greatest danger we face is a neglect of one another, of neglecting our soul's closeness
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.240]   to Jesus.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.620]   The message here is simple, beginning with reminding them in verse 7 to remember their
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.320]   leaders who first told them the gospel and then concluding the thought in verse 17, a
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.660]   final word, not just about the leaders who first heard them, some of whom were gone and
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.980]   died and gone to heaven, some of whom were the apostolic witness.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.200]   Some of them knew Jesus personally, those earliest leaders had passed away, but he's
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.180]   reminding them they're still leaders they needed to follow, they're still a part of
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.460]   this Christian community, they need this accountability, they need these leaders, they need this discipleship,
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.740]   their souls need to be clinging to other souls so that they can never give up meeting together,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.980]   that they would not turn back to their former manner of life, that they would not estimate
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.300]   the cost of following Jesus to be too high for them.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.480]   And so his final words for them are to follow leaders who follow Jesus and to find his grace
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.920]   satisfying and to be willing to bear the reproach that Jesus bore and to further follow not
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:15:01.220]   just the leaders that are gone, but to follow leaders today, leaders like us who are imperfect,
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.060]   but we need each other and we need to stay close to Jesus if our witness and our perseverance
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.220]   is to remain intact.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:22.300]   It's his grace that will motivate and sustain and uphold every faithful pastor.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:29.420]   The best way to look at this is in five points because Steve Lawson requires all of us to
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:39.940]   use only five points, never more, never less.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.920]   And so how do we triumph through pastoring of all things?
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:52.780]   On verses 7 through 8, first thing we see is that we must be steadfast in faith, steadfast
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.780]   in faith.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:16:04.820]   Look at verse 7, "Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you, and considering
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.100]   the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:21.420]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:27.940]   We all understand that pastors are a result of other pastors, right?
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.580]   The reason that you're a spiritual leader in your church today is because other spiritual
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:39.460]   leaders taught you, discipled you, invested in you, and that is exactly what the author
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:46.960]   of Hebrews has in mind as he instructs these struggling Christians on the brink of considering
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.540]   a return to their former manner of life, that they need to remember the faithful witness
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:59.580]   of those Christians who led them, who spoke the word of God to them, and to consider the
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.220]   result of their conduct and to imitate their faith.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:10.900]   And so the recollection is to those leaders, and the tense of the verbs makes us think
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.020]   these are the leaders who are no longer with them.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.420]   They would be the immediate leaders who shared the gospel, who planted these churches, who
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:26.580]   ministered directly to these people, those closest to the apostles and to those who followed
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.580]   the apostles.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.380]   That's who's being brought to mind.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.460]   In the context of the epistle to Hebrews, it's undoubtedly inclusive of the triumphant
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.780]   faith on display in Hebrews chapter 11, the hall of witnesses.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:48.140]   And so the Christian being spurred towards steadfastness in their faith is taught first
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:54.060]   to look at good examples that have gone before them, those who have taught the word of God
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:00.620]   to them and, as importantly, modeled what they taught, and to remind them that those
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.260]   are the people who are worth remembering and worth imitating, especially due to the reality
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.180]   that many of them have finished the race.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:19.060]   And so my mind goes to pastors, famous and not famous, who poured into my life when I
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.140]   was an 18-year-old youth pastor.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:30.020]   There's nothing worse than having an 18-year-old youth pastor.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:37.580]   But the glory of a young man is his strength, so we lock in 30-hour famine, whole deal.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.300]   And patient pastors poured into my life.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.660]   And that's continued through the years, and every one of us can think of the name of our
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.860]   pastors who loved us and corrected us and taught us and showed us how to live and gave
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.100]   us that faithful example of perseverant faith.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:06.420]   It's a beautiful reminder that is in accordance with everything we read in the Bible about
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.020]   the relationship of our teaching and our living.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:18.500]   Paul tells Timothy to watch his life and his doctrine, for by it he'll save himself and
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.860]   those who hear him.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:28.680]   And so this is another reminder that steadfastness in faith needs to be dependent on the example
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.460]   of others who are steadfast in their faith, right?
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.020]   And so I'm grateful to brothers that I can see with my eyes right now and that I can't
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.080]   see with my eyes right now, who have gone to heaven, who invested in me when I was at
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.940]   my dumbest.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:53.100]   You think back to the Sunday school teacher who shared the gospel with you or to faithful
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:20:01.120]   grandparents or a mom and dad who kept dragging you to church.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.440]   They taught the Word of God to you, they led you, and they showed you what it meant to
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.600]   live out the faith.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:16.940]   Faith being one of the great themes of the book of Hebrews, it's faith, truly faith that's
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   on display throughout this entire book.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:29.780]   It begins in Hebrews 4, and he says it was faith that caused the first generation who
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:36.340]   rebelled against God in the wilderness, it was their lack of faith that caused them to
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.480]   have hard hearts.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:46.180]   In Hebrews 6, it's a reminder that the foundation of repentance is faith towards God, it's the
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.460]   starting point of the Christian religion.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.940]   Hebrews 6 tells us that they ought not to be sluggish, but imitators of those who through
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.100]   faith and patience inherit the promises.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.780]   Hebrews 10 says draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.500]   And then Hebrews 11 says faith dozens of times.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:13.780]   A reminder to our ears of the centrality of faith that is believed and entrusted and passed
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:24.660]   on from generation to generation, and just as important as being taught, being lived.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:31.880]   And so to remember those faithful examples that went before them in steadfastness.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.500]   And then we hit verse 8.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.460]   And verse 8 is great.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.620]   People love verse 8.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:45.860]   They pull it right out of here, and it never gets to see this spot again.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:50.620]   It lives on a magnet on your fridge.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.760]   Grandma going to crochet that.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.100]   Crochet is not the right word, but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.500]   Maybe she's really good at crocheting.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:07.220]   That verse lives in systematic theology as the doctrine of immutability, and we're grateful
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.020]   for that reality.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:15.740]   But in this context, it has an even greater significance.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:21.420]   You see, the people in verse 7 are not around anymore.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.260]   The earlier disciples, the earlier evangelists, some of them have passed away, or they're
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.260]   no longer in this community, and they need an ongoing example.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.220]   They need someone with constancy, someone who will be there for them, someone who they
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.820]   can't hang on to for only a moment when they were converted, and then that person moves
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   on, a missionary to a different place, whatever.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.220]   They need something ongoing that's going to give them that, and in verse 17, they'll be
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.780]   reminded of their present leaders, not to be simply and purely nostalgic about leaders
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.060]   in the past, but to look to their current spiritual leaders and follow them as they
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.260]   follow Jesus.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.860]   But there's a greater constancy behind every spiritual leader that's drawn out in Hebrews
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.460]   13, verse 8, and it isn't - the argument of Hebrews 13, 8 isn't, "Well, they spoke in
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.820]   tongues in the book of Acts, that's why we speak in tongues today.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.580]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.620]   That's a wonky argument.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.660]   It's out of the context.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:29.140]   The context is saying that the constancy of Jesus Christ is not first and foremost the
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:34.340]   doctrine of immutability, or just a verse that brings comfort, that Jesus is the same
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.700]   as Jesus always was.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.600]   It's a reminder that the constancy of Jesus today and yesterday and forever has everything
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:49.580]   to do with us being sustained in our pursuit of sanctification and glorification, our following
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.340]   of leaders who follow Jesus.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:58.060]   And so we remember that the person who invested in us and discipled us and evangelized us
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:04.880]   represented someone who will never change and never falter and never drift and always
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.360]   provide leaders as a gift to His church.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:18.340]   What is behind every true God-honoring, Bible-preaching, faith-exhibiting, and holiness-pursuing pastor
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.660]   is the chief shepherd himself.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.900]   It's Jesus Christ, the one who's the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:35.620]   And that's helpful because we all have leaders in our life who have failed us in this age
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.260]   of apostasy and deconstruction.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:45.100]   Some of the finest and most effective disciples in some of your lives that brought you to
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.900]   places of greater maturity and introduced you to ministry or baptized you or confronted
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:58.180]   your sin no longer walk with Jesus, and that is a heartbreaking experience.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.740]   So what are we supposed to do?
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.460]   Quit like they did?
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:09.740]   Or remember that for a time they helped us because though they could not remain constant
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.540]   and though they were fallen and frail and imperfect, and some of them maybe not even
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:20.460]   genuine followers of Jesus, they pointed us to the one who would always be there for us,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.080]   who would always teach us, who would always model for us, always provide for us ongoing
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.980]   leadership in our lives through real people who are shepherding us on behalf of the chief
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.800]   shepherd.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.820]   This isn't some abstract theological concept coming out in verse 8.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.940]   This is a reminder that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.940]   Chapter 5, verse 7, "In the days of His flesh, when Jesus was on earth, He offered up prayers
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:54.620]   and supplications with loud crying and tears to the one who was to save Him from death.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.300]   He was heard because of His piety."
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.740]   What's that a description of?
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.980]   Jesus' earthly life.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:05.860]   What He's done in the past is of significance by way of imitation and by way of faithfulness.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.260]   Jesus' present ministry has already been featured extensively in this book.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.260]   What about today?
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:22.660]   Hebrews 4, verse 15, "We don't have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.980]   but one who's been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:32.900]   Therefore let us currently, right now, draw near with confidence to the throne of grace
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:39.240]   so that we might receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need."
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   That's what I need today.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.780]   Isn't that what you need?
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.780]   Help from Jesus?
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.840]   Well, He's the same Jesus as yesterday.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.960]   And today He provides help, and His throne of grace is available and accessible.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.100]   What about tomorrow, Jesus?
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:01.380]   Well, He's not just a historical figure, and He's not just elevated to the place of
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.520]   current help, but we can be confident that currently He is our mediator and our sympathetic
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:15.580]   high priest, but we can be ensured that forever, Hebrews 7, 25, He is able to save forever
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:21.980]   those who draw near to God through Him since He always lives to make intercession for us.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.460]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.140]   And so what does that have in common with verse 7?
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.500]   The imitation and influence of those who are faithful are always reflecting the constancy
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.260]   of Jesus in your life.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.360]   You see, Jesus in your life is never going to be the only leadership that's seen in your
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   life.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.520]   He's never going to be just you and Jesus because Jesus is the constant one, but because
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.560]   Jesus is the one who is only and truly faithful, He will always have other imperfect leaders
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:57.600]   in your life who are faithfully trying to follow Jesus, the chief shepherd, under shepherds
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   who serve you and feed you and lead you.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.080]   That's who we, brothers, are called to be, faithful leaders who follow Jesus so that
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.680]   we can, like Paul, say, "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:22.320]   Faithful, influential, imitatable.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.760]   All of us under King Jesus is a perfect example of steadfastness as He remains the same and
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.880]   is always available for His people.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.520]   He always has been and He always will be.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.960]   Remember your leaders, their words, verbal, exemplary, the consequences of their lives
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.360]   before all of us following.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   These leaders worship Jesus and when they're dead and gone, Christians will still worship
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:53.080]   Jesus and He tells them because Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:03.520]   There's a second way that pastor triumph occurs, that triumph exists in pastoral ministry and
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.040]   it's in verses 9 and 10.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:11.320]   Not only are we to be steadfast in faith, but we're to be strengthened by grace.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.880]   So 7 and 8 are steadfast in faith, 9 and 10 are strengthened by grace.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.920]   He calls them to be strengthened by grace.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.880]   Look at what it says, "Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings, for it is
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.200]   good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods through which those who were
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.680]   so occupied were not benefited.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:39.360]   We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat."
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.680]   Now that is some very epistles to the Hebrew language.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.540]   And no wonder many commentators find this to be assorted commands.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:59.120]   And though it is dangerous to talk about food at 1146, "You've been overfed, you'll be fine."
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:10.980]   I'm sorry, we've been overfed.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:19.300]   This mention of food is helping us see what it means to be strengthened, an important
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:25.960]   concept in this book, by grace.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:33.220]   This original audience was currently struggling with understanding the superiority of the
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:40.680]   New Covenant over the old, whether it was rituals or temple worship or holy days or
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.040]   regulations about food, kosher kind of stuff.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.620]   They had, like so many of their contemporaries, confused the relationship between the dietary
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.680]   laws and the grace of God.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.400]   And I know this doesn't sound very relevant to you unless you came out of first century
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   Judaism.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.480]   There are some of you that are old, but not that old.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:12.080]   But it's a reminder that false teaching about grace is still as prevalent today as ever.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.600]   We've been warned about it repeatedly in this conference.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.440]   Dr. MacArthur spoke of the dangers of antinomianism.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:28.960]   We've been warned about the threat of legalism and externalism if we don't guard our hearts
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.800]   rightly, and we're aware of all the false religions that surround and threaten our people.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.420]   And so verse 9 and 10 reads a lot like the book of Galatians.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:43.760]   It reminds us not to fall back into the kind of legalism that their contemporaries knew
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.400]   all too well, and to keep at the forefront of our mind the advantage of grace.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.760]   Because there is a greater advantage of grace over ceremonial foods.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.980]   You see, it was a big deal for them about what they ate and what they couldn't eat
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:04.240]   and what day of the week it was and what rituals and what matters of religion were happening.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:11.080]   Ten thousand ordinances and dietary restrictions and laws and weights and measures and tithes
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.640]   and Sabbaths and festivals and everything else.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:23.560]   And none of those things in the old covenant were ever intended to be the focus.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.220]   They were intended to point to the God who gave them to them to cause His people to be
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:36.480]   aware of their sinfulness, dependent on Him, and aware of His grace as they were to be
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.680]   separate from the world.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.800]   Every single law and regulation not only served to condemn the people to show and highlight
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:52.360]   their sinfulness, it sought to show and highlight to the people that they belonged to God and
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.320]   that He was a God who operated on the basis of grace.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.620]   That's the message of the Old Testament.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:05.880]   It is not exclusively - grace is not exclusively the message of the new covenant.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   And so, this pastor wants these believers to understand something that we need to understand
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:20.240]   in our own battle against antinomianism or legalism, and it is that the nutritional value
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.840]   of legalism is zero.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.440]   He wants them to know that those who try to make Christianity externally focused are doing
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.800]   it completely wrong.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.280]   And I think that's what we face today.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:44.440]   Not dietary restrictions, but just a million made-up rules that can come under the cover
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:50.900]   of a cult or under the cover of someone who thinks that you earn Jesus' favor by something
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.440]   that you do.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.000]   The word here is the word that means kidnapped, stolen, robbed.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.820]   Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:08.580]   This is anything that takes out of God's plan of salvation and the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.520]   Christ - the centrality of grace.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:21.280]   That salvation is only and solely and exclusively the result of God's mercy.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.840]   Not good parenting.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.000]   Not fastidiousness.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.640]   You don't have God's favor because you have separated from the world.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.980]   You don't have God's favor because you vote right.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.840]   You don't have God's favor because you're such a good pastor.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.960]   You have God's favor because you don't deserve God's favor.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.440]   That's how grace works.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:58.840]   And so he reminds them of that in their context, saying it's good for the heart to be strengthened
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:08.920]   not by foods, but by grace, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:17.960]   The only benefit we'll find in our obedience to God is the obedience that flows from a
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:24.320]   heart that's been captured by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, His undeserved mercy
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.920]   that He took our sins on Himself and died in our place, and we have right standing with
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.440]   God and access to that throne of grace because of what Jesus has done.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.740]   Grace flows and grows from the fountain of grace.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.460]   It wasn't their diet that ever made them God's people.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.120]   It was God who made them God's people.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.640]   Everything else was conforming in signs and symbols and shadows of something greater to
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   come.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.040]   Their sanctification had now become holistic.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.880]   It was accomplished by the blood of Jesus in making them holy.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.720]   And so he introduces to them this idea of two altars, verse 10.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.160]   We have an altar.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.400]   And that had to be mind-blowing words to these Hebrew listeners because they weren't allowed
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.060]   to go to the altar anymore.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:20.120]   It was obviously blasphemous for them to go back to the temple and offer an offering of
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.440]   any kind in light of what Jesus had done.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.440]   And so for him to say, "We have an altar," now they very well didn't have an altar.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   They knew that.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:40.240]   I mean, bronze lever, altar, sprinkled blood, ephod, priests, veils, walls, temple, Herod
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.920]   court, that's where the altar was.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   And these Christians, like these Christians, rent a middle school gym.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:57.680]   Context, right?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   Where's the pomp?
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.840]   I mean, this is a beautiful building, but it's just a bunch of bricks and stuff.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.440]   This doesn't look like the temple.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:16.400]   Where's the altar that this author is speaking of, and what does it have to do with being
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.000]   strengthened by grace?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.120]   Well moving them away from these external regulations and these dietary laws that were
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.720]   never effectual, he's showing them that Jesus accomplished something, and he's been teaching
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.880]   them through this entire letter, that he appeared as the high priest of good things to come.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.040]   He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with his hands, not of
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.800]   his creation, and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.560]   He entered the holy place once and for all, having established eternal redemption.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:57.520]   And so he's teaching them, do not choose external regulations over the internal and eternal
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.000]   realities that Jesus has accomplished.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.240]   Look, brother pastors, we obey Jesus with our bodies.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.460]   We still follow many commands that God has given to us.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:15.240]   We want to, with all our hearts, avoid sexual immorality like the Bible tells us to do.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:21.640]   But that prohibition and every other prohibition is based and rooted and grounded in the reality
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.560]   that is internally motivated, and has very little to do with what's on the outside of
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.560]   you.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.120]   It has everything to do with what God is doing by grace on the inside of you.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.660]   That's the direction that he's reorienting their obedience towards.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:42.600]   He's pointing them towards an altar, not one that the priest had to hose off after every
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:49.280]   Yom Kippur and have to reload and every atonement and every offering, he's pointing towards
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:57.520]   an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle, that's the priestly class, have no right to
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.560]   eat.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.480]   Do you understand what incredible access we have to the very presence of God?
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:11.000]   Because the Holy of Holies, I mean, that was just like a tented room.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.160]   It was sacred, but it was only symbolic.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:24.040]   What Jesus accomplished on this altar is what takes you, a sinner by nature and choice,
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.960]   and transforms you to a trophy of God's grace.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.520]   The cross of Christ, that's the altar he's referring to, that altar on that cursed hill,
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.800]   Gethsemane, where Jesus shed his blood, we have an altar that they cannot access, and
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.920]   the reason they cannot access that altar is because they do not have faith, and the reason
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:52.360]   they do not have faith is they have not become the recipients of the grace of God.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.920]   Ultimately, it all comes down to that.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.840]   And so, he's showing them that the way they'll be strengthened for final perseverance is
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.080]   by the grace of God.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.920]   And he continues his thought on the two altars and teaches us a third reality for triumph
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:21.560]   in pastoral ministry, and it's this, they must be separated unto Jesus, verses 11-14.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.060]   It says, "For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.040]   by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.880]   Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.800]   outside the gate.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:42.900]   So let us go out to him, outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.480]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city of God which is to
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.880]   come."
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:56.140]   No more physical altar because Jesus died on the cross, and this had to be a struggle
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.200]   for them to overcome.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:09.280]   The rituals were now replaced by reality, but they're taking part of Christ himself.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:16.960]   And the author's trying to contrast two altars, and he's showing them by interweaving in this
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.280]   example of steadfastness of their former leaders and the strength that God's grace provides
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:28.320]   to his people, the necessity of them being separated with Jesus, and they knew exactly
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.040]   what separation looked like.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:37.680]   Separation to them looked like every aspect of their life being devoted to God in a thousand
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.320]   particular ways.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:47.500]   And now, it wasn't going to be their clothing and their diet and their festivals.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:57.040]   It was to be association with the sacrifice and communion and table of the Lord.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   That's how they were going to be separated with Jesus.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.240]   For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.640]   priest, this is one of the reasons I think the temple was still standing at the time
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.200]   of the writing of the book of Hebrews.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.440]   He's talking about it as something happening right now, probably in Jerusalem, not far
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.920]   from where they are.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.800]   He's referring to it, the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.720]   place by the high priest as a sacrifice for sins are burned outside the camp.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   What's he talking about?
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.600]   Well, he's contrasting the sacrifice of two altars, the first in offering from Leviticus
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.960]   16.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.320]   The people would bring their animals.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.920]   The priest would take the perfect animal to the altar, kill the animal on the altar just
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.680]   outside the holy place, and then enter into the holy place.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.840]   It would sprinkle blood from the offering unto the holy of holies, all part of the atonement
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.280]   ritual involving the blood of spotless animals.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.960]   For centuries, God's people did it to remind themselves of the consequences of their sin.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   Hebrews 9 describes it, but look at what he says beyond verse 11.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.840]   After saying that they would dispose of those offerings, the animals' corpses would be taken
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.000]   outside of the temple grounds and actually outside of all the camp of Israel, and the
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.360]   regulation was they needed to be consumed with fire, burned completely.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.520]   All that was left over from the sacrificial offering was to be burned outside the camp
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.360]   because it was no longer clean.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.920]   The blood had been offered, the animal had been dealt with, now it needs to be burned
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:29.240]   outside of the presence of the people, otherwise the people would be defiled.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:36.280]   But then he gives us another altar to compare and contrast in verse 12.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.200]   The altar where Jesus sanctified the people through his own blood and suffered outside
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   the gate.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.560]   "Therefore, let us go outside the camp and bear reproach that he endured no lasting city."
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.620]   There's a lot going on here.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.880]   What do we do with it?
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.920]   Well, the contrast that follows verse 11, he says there's something similar about these
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.780]   two sacrifices.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:01.220]   The old sacrificial system and the sacrifice that Jesus made of his own body on the cross.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.560]   So what was similar?
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   Well he says in verses 11 and 12, they were both destroyed outside the camp.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.320]   In what way was Jesus' body drug outside the camp?
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:17.320]   Well in a very literal way, according to John 19 verses 17 through 20, Jesus suffered outside
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.760]   the city walls, no longer in the temple complex, no longer in the confines of the holy city
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.680]   because that's what Jews did.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.880]   Jews crucified their blasphemous criminals on a hill outside of Jerusalem.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.840]   It's where Jesus walked at spear point, forced by the Roman soldier to carry his cross until
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:44.260]   Simon intervened to assist, but to walk and be scorned and whipped and to suffer alongside
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:50.200]   of other criminals, and they did it out there because it was the right way to do that kind
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.320]   of dirty work outside.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   It was defiling.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.820]   It was unacceptable.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:02.800]   And so to put the criminals out there is where they sent Jesus out of our holy city, Jesus.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.200]   This is our city, Jesus, not your city.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:13.040]   You go and die outside of these walls on that forsaken hill outside of the holy city because
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.920]   that's what they were saying, He deserves to die.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.160]   Jesus is unclean, Jesus is accursed is what the religious leaders of the day were saying.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:27.760]   And so suddenly Jesus had something in common with the corpse of a bull or goat that their
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:34.000]   forefathers had sacrificed uncountable times as they drug those bodies of those animals
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.120]   outside of the city and burned them completely because they wouldn't dare be defiled by that
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.840]   deadness.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.880]   And Jesus suffered out there.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.400]   That's what was similar.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.360]   They were both destroyed outside the camp.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.480]   But what was different?
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.560]   Look again at verse 12.
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:05.920]   So Jesus also suffered outside the gate, here's the difference, in order to sanctify the people,
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.320]   to make the people holy through His own blood.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.480]   The difference between that sacrifice and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross is that
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.760]   Jesus' sacrifice was once for all, that it accomplished something that all those other
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.860]   sacrifices merely prefigured, merely foreshadowed.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.360]   No sin was truly atoned for by the blood of bulls and goats.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.720]   That was only a cry to God for mercy.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.820]   And God heard that cry fully and finally when His own Son shed His own blood on that cross,
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:41.680]   you see the difference between the old sacrifice and the old system, and these people were
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:49.400]   so accustomed to worshiping with all that ritual and all that blood and all the sacrifice
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.560]   of animals and everything that attended to it.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.520]   And they had to wonder, what about the ritual?
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   What about the beauty?
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.080]   What about the animal selection?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.600]   What about the costliness?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.760]   What about the incense and priestly garb?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.460]   It was all gone and it was hard for them.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:13.980]   But this pastor is pleading with them to remind them that none of that stuff could do what
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:20.260]   the sacrifice of Jesus did, that none of that stuff could make you holy.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:26.460]   And in a moment, the sacrifice of Jesus accomplished it all.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:31.960]   So it's truly a better sacrifice as He's been teaching them all along in the parallel passages
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.920]   - Jesus sanctified the people.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.580]   He said this in chapter 10, verse 29, Jesus' blood truly cleanses us, sanctifies us, makes
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.740]   us holy.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:45.980]   Not the way the prefigured sacrifices did, but in reality, the blood of Jesus makes us
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   holy.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.620]   And when you think of the cross of Christ, you must think of the holiness that He accomplished
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.920]   for us there.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.660]   He bore our sin.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:01.300]   He granted us His righteousness so that we could be accepted by God.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:06.320]   True cleansing, not of animal sacrifices, but through the Son of God, pouring out His
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.840]   life for us.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.920]   And in verse 13, we're supposed to do something with that.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:19.000]   Look at what it says, "Therefore, let us go to Him, Jesus, outside the camp, and bear
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.640]   the reproach He endured."
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.620]   Others struggle with this line because it's either telling these people that symbolically
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.040]   they need to go outside the camp.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:33.280]   Remember the camp in Leviticus, a dozen times or so means unholy, unclean, secular, not
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.900]   sacred, dirty, defiled.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.120]   Outside the camp was to be punished, was to be put out of the people of God.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.240]   What was outside was dirty, what was inside was clean, inside was sanctified, outside
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   was defiled.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.520]   And He told them, all these Jewish background believers, that they should go to Jesus outside
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.560]   the camp and bear their reproach He endured.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.240]   So we might be saying to them that Jesus suffered and died and was treated unclean by the world,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.400]   and so they need to be not attached to the world.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.640]   They need to be separated from the world.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.040]   And that may be part of the argument.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.920]   Others say that this author has given them permission to fully and finally walk out of
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.240]   Jerusalem.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   Stop waiting here.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   Go fulfill the great commission.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.880]   This city has nothing for you anymore.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.360]   And that may be an implication of this verse, but I don't think that's exactly what he's
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.360]   saying.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.200]   I think what he's saying in verse 12 and 13, when he tells them, "Therefore, let us go
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:23.420]   outside the camp and bear the reproach He endured," is simply a reminder that ultimately
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.440]   these people need to remember what is clean and what is not clean.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   That security and safety and identity and holiness will not be found anywhere outside
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.640]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:45.140]   That security and safety and identity is not in who they used to be or in some kind of
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.000]   false teaching or ritualism.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.960]   This is such a good word to young seminary brothers who are maybe tempted by Eastern
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.600]   Orthodox ritualism or who have looked at Rome and thought, "Look, it's big and fancy.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:06.560]   It's got junk and - sorry, Luther word - rituals and smoke and saints and junk."
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   I went to the Vatican last year in full protest.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.080]   Just I'd never seen it before.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:22.440]   And we had a really sweet Roman Catholic tour guide lady, and I had a hard time controlling
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   myself.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.240]   So we went through the Vatican with all the people, looking at all what Luther called
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   the Pope's secondhand junk, pillaged from all over the world, right?
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.720]   And she kept saying things like, "The Holy Father is going to be here tomorrow and talk
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:47.280]   to 150,000 people," and the only thing that I kept saying during the tour was, "I'm sorry
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   to hear that."
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:07.160]   This author is trying to get their eyes, the eyes of their heart, their faith, Hebrews
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:14.360]   chapter 12, fixed and focused on Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:19.200]   They won't find security, safety and identity anywhere else.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.560]   And Jesus walked out the walls of the holy city and He died and was cursed of God and
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.720]   shunned by the people He came to save, and they too ought to follow Jesus in bearing
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:34.920]   His reproach, in being called and seen as unclean and despicable and cut off from God,
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.560]   no longer following His rituals, no longer being called God's covenant people.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.880]   They need to bear that reproach because that's the reproach that Jesus bore.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   What is He saying?
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.800]   Simply, He's saying, "Follow Jesus.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   Follow Jesus."
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   F.F.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:56.000]   Bruce says it this way, "They had been accustomed to think of the camp and all that was inside
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.600]   as sacred, while everything outside was profane and unclean.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:06.360]   Were they to leave its sacred precincts and venture on to unhallowed ground?"
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:13.980]   Yes, yes, because in Jesus, the old values had been reversed.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:22.340]   What was formerly sacred was now unhallowed because Jesus had been expelled from it.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:28.200]   You see, if Jesus isn't in your church, if Jesus isn't in your Christianity, if it is
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:35.800]   not cruciform in its direction and shape and worship, if it's purpose-driven instead of
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:48.120]   Jesus-driven, then you've kicked Him out of His rightful place just like they did in this
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.280]   ugly scene.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.720]   You see, if Jesus isn't in it, it's not of God.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.840]   It's not blessed of God.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   It's not holy.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   It's not hallowed.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   It's not sacred.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.480]   And once Jesus was kicked out of His nation and out of His people and out of the temple,
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.720]   and when He was hung on that cross, accomplishing the salvation of all who He would wash with
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:13.340]   His blood, that which was formerly unhallowed was now sacred because Jesus was there.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:18.720]   He's telling these believers and He's telling you that all that's left for us is not ritual,
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.740]   no further sacrifices to be rendered.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:27.000]   It is simply to follow Jesus, follow Jesus, bear reproach with Jesus, take on suffering
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.540]   with Jesus, go where Jesus went, follow Him until the day you die.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:36.160]   You will not find security and safety and identity anywhere else that will bring you
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.840]   final salvation and persevering grace except in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.140]   In Him is our security.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.820]   He is the one who will hold us fast.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.460]   In Him is your safety.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.140]   He is the one who will watch over you and protect you.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.080]   In Him is your identity.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.800]   You are now the one that Jesus loves and that should define you.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:05.700]   You who were formerly blasphemers, unclean, Gentiles, are now holy because Jesus has washed
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.540]   us with His blood.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:13.840]   And so the word is, follow Jesus and bear His reproach.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:20.000]   Verse 14 is the answer, "We here do not have a lasting city, but we're seeking the city
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   which is to come."
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:32.400]   Friend, what a word that is today to my post-meal Christian nationalist brothers with your strong
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:43.000]   families and your desire to rock the vote and invest in beard oil companies.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Remember, here we have no lasting city.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.080]   My kingdom is not of this world, Jesus said, and He's right.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.400]   We're seeking the city which is to come.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.240]   All the things that we cherish and value in this world and even in our own fair city are
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.440]   not going to last forever, and so this author is pointing us towards a city whose foundation
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.280]   cannot be shaken.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.000]   Since chapter 11, he's been telling us not to stay, be like Moses who wouldn't stay in
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.080]   Egypt but went on.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.680]   So he's urging them to go with Jesus and go where Jesus went, and the end of their life
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:32.260]   needs to be aimed at the new city of Jerusalem, at the heavenly version, not the earthly one,
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.000]   that it needs to be the city of God and not the city of man, the city of the world to
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.800]   come and not the city of this world, and there to tremble at the sight of that city and long
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.860]   at the sight of that city because that's the city that Jesus inhabits and promises and
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:52.320]   prepares a place for us, and we come with empty hands and no sacrifices and no animals
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:59.120]   and no grain offerings, but we still have, point four, a sacrifice of praise.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.120]   What's our sacrifice?
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.560]   Verse 15 and 16, "Through Him let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God that
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.760]   is the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name and not neglect doing good or sharing
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.160]   for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:22.280]   We don't bring critters to sacrifice.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.780]   We bring something else.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:30.240]   We bring our worship of Jesus and our work among others.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.240]   We do good because we follow Jesus in good doing.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.980]   We don't grow weary of good doing because Jesus is our example of doing good, and we
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.100]   share with others because who cares?
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.100]   This isn't our stuff.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.300]   This isn't our city.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   It's not going to last.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.080]   This whole place is going down.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.440]   Our city is to come, and so we give our lives away for the needs of others.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:57:01.520]   That's what's being described in these verses, and we bring a sacrifice of praise.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:09.680]   And then finally, we have before us submission to shepherds, point five, verse 17, a familiar
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   verse.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.320]   I don't need to overwork it for you.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.400]   We're to live in submission to shepherds, all of us.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.680]   Pastors submitting to pastors because it's obey your leaders, a very general word for
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:28.920]   spiritual leadership in the New Testament, but pluralized intentionally.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:35.640]   No rock star, one-man show, pastoral ministry, but shepherds plural.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:41.400]   Not one guy with a personality, but godly men who follow Jesus and teach the Word of
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:51.840]   Jesus, whose authority, they're very mindful, is not their own but belongs to Jesus himself.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:59.500]   You're following and you're leading people, pastor, you're leading people who are called
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:05.400]   to submit to you, and you should hold that with a very careful grip.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.840]   My friend Mark Devers says authority is like soap.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.920]   The more you have, the more you use, the less you have, right?
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.400]   That's how soap works.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:22.040]   Hence, I remember right here in a Q&A on a Sunday night, not too long ago, a lady asked
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:27.880]   John MacArthur, he was standing right here, and she said, "John MacArthur, how much authority
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.600]   do you have?"
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.920]   And all the associate pastors went, "Ee, ee."
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   No, we didn't.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.680]   I don't know what made her ask that, but she did.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:44.560]   And he said, "None but this."
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.020]   Pastors don't need to be bossy pants.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.840]   They need to be heralds of the Word of God.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.760]   I'm not going to boss you on the 10,000 issues of liberty in your Christian life.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.640]   You have soul competency, spirit lives in you.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:03.900]   Bossy pastors, heavy-handed pastors are the worst.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:10.520]   And when they dictate outside of what God requires of His people, they stand on very
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   dangerous ground, and so this word about submission is chiastically bookended around the whole
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.460]   point of spiritual leadership, which is, it's not about us.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.760]   It's not about our authority.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:30.840]   It's not about our word or our great ability to preach or our ability to do dynamic programs
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.520]   in the church.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:43.840]   Pastors, the triumph of pastoral ministry exists as leaders, pastors follow Jesus faithfully
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:52.080]   and invite their people to walk alongside of them all the way to where Jesus is.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.300]   That's our calling.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:59.060]   We can do nothing else of value.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:04.440]   As gospel preachers, we speak authoritatively from the Word of God when we call men and
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.800]   women to repent of their sins and turn and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.680]   That's the authority of our message, and as we walk faithfully with Jesus, we show them
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:20.100]   what it means to truly follow Him, no matter what the cost.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:25.100]   And our message is the message of the chief shepherd, the one who went outside the camp
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:31.820]   and the one who's awaiting them, and at the right hand of God praying for them at that
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:36.460]   eschatological finish line.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:45.100]   Spurgeon's autobiography, he closes it channeling his best bunion.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:53.900]   He's thinking thoroughly influenced by the pilgrim's progress, and he describes the pastor's
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:01.140]   triumph in very similar language.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:11.340]   Listen to what he says, "I am occupied in my small way as Mr. Great Heart was employed
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.580]   in Bunion's day.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:20.660]   I do not compare myself with that champion, but I am in the same line of business."
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.860]   Spurgeon's description of a pastor, what he's supposed to do.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:33.820]   "I am engaged in personally conducted tours to heaven, and I have with me at the present
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.660]   time dear old Father Honest.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.460]   I'm glad he's still alive and active.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.020]   And there is Christina and there are her children, and it's my business as best I can to kill
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:49.700]   dragons and cut off giants' heads and lead on the timid and trembling, and I'm often
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.780]   afraid of losing some of the weaklings.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:58.140]   I have the heartache for them, but by God's grace and your kind and generous help in looking
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:05.780]   after one another, I hope we shall all travel safely to the river's edge.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:11.300]   And how many have I had to part with there?
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:17.820]   I've stood on the brink, I've heard them singing in the midst of the stream, and I've almost
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:24.700]   seen the shining ones leading them up the hill and through the gates into the celestial
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.460]   city."
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:36.340]   Father, help us to be faithful in our pastoral ministry, to pay attention to our life and
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:46.540]   teaching, and to exclusively and wholeheartedly and devotively follow Jesus.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:52.380]   To bring all your precious people along with us, steadfast in faith, strengthened by your
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:03:01.500]   grace, separated unto Jesus, even under reproach, bringing that sacrifice of praise, submitting
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.980]   to leaders because we know we can't do this alone.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.900]   Father, thank you for your Word and the reminder to us.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.580]   Thank you for the leadership of Jesus in our lives.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:16.820]   Help us to follow the one who entered that unhallowed ground, knowing that he defines
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:22.460]   what is sacred and holy, and it's by his blood he makes us acceptable to you.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:29.180]   May we follow Jesus without hesitation or reservation, wherever he leads, amen.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.180]   Amen.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   Amen.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   Amen.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.240]   you
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.300]   you
