[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Income tax especially, I feel, is a gateway drug to the surveillance state.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.320]   One of the advantages of land value tax is you don't even care necessarily who owns the land.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.800]   You're just like, hey, 4732 Apple Street, make sure the check shows up in the mail.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.920]   I don't care how many shell companies in the Bahamas you've obscured your identity with,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.840]   just put the check in the mail, Mr. Address.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.480]   Whereas the income tax needs to do this full anal probe on everyone in the country
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   and then audits the poor at a higher rate than the rich.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.960]   And it's just this horrible burden we have.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   And then it gives the government this kind of presumed right to know
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.480]   what you're doing about everything you're doing, this massive invasion of privacy.
