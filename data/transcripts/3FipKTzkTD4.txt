[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Before we get to the questions though, I want to do a deep dive.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   The big question I want to address in today's deep dive is the following.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.900]   How does Cal organize his life?
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.100]   I've talked about this before, but I'm going to get granular today.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200]   And let me tell you why.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.100]   Because of a recent experience I had just a couple days before
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.900]   recording this episode.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.700]   I got very stressed/anxious to the point where I actually lost a lot of sleep.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.300]   So yesterday I was very tired.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600]   I was having a hard time sleeping because once my mind got fired up,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.700]   I had a hard time falling asleep.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000]   Here was the thing that was making me stressed and anxious.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.800]   The fall semester is beginning.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.600]   I usually go a little bit lax.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.300]   We'll talk about this.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.600]   I go a little bit lax on my systems in the summer.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.900]   I'm a professor/writer.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900]   So in the summer, I have very little to do but write.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.000]   I lean into that.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.000]   I take the foot off the gas, put a little bit of my organizational systems.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And then I have to get things locked back in for the fall because things get more busy.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Well, in the summer, I had accreted all of these ancillary new or miscellaneous
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   disciplines and systems and ideas and projects that I wanted to tackle.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And I had these notes about all these different things I was working on
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   spread out over many different digital media and many different notebooks.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.100]   And a couple days ago, I was like, okay, I have to actually get this stuff all wrangled
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.900]   and get my systems all ready for the fall.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.700]   And I couldn't make it work.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.700]   Some of them were redundant with other things.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.400]   Some things didn't quite make sense.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   Some things seemed like it was just too much.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I was asking myself, there's too many initiatives I was trying to get going.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.300]   And it really stressed me out to the point where I had a hard time sleeping.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.200]   And yesterday morning, I had an epiphany.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.300]   And I'm going to put quotation marks around epiphany here because it is the exact
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.900]   same epiphany I have every single fall.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.900]   Which is that the planning system that I have been perfecting over a decade,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.300]   I've been using this for a decade, is what works for me.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.400]   And every time I try to reinvent the wheel or add new components onto this,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500]   I get stressed out.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.100]   And so I said, you know, I need to do forget this like I do every fall,
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.500]   go back to my standard planning system,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   get all of the pieces of that standard system up and running, and I feel much better.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.300]   I feel much better.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.200]   This happens to me every summer.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.300]   I think I'm going to come up with some new exciting thing that's going to really
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900]   jumpstart some sort of ambition of mine.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.600]   And I always go back to my same old tried and true three-part planning system
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.700]   that has performed.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.400]   Everything I have done as a professional in the last decade,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.900]   which is most of my books, most of my academic work,
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.800]   happens because of this planning system.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900]   So in honor of it, and in honor of it being the fall and back to school,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.200]   and work ramping up again for a lot of people,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   I thought I would go through briefly,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   but clearly through the planning system I do to organize the stuff in my life
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.500]   and figure out what to do with my time.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.000]   So I have a document.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300]   I call this the root document of the core document,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.900]   where I just describe the system.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.700]   This, I think, is an important place to start.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.200]   I call this rooted productivity, where you have somewhere a core document
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.900]   from which everything you do actually comes out of it.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   Because to me, it's important that everything is written down,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.700]   you know where to find it.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.900]   So I like to have one core document that just summarizes,
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.300]   here's the pieces of your system.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.500]   So I just have that somewhere.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's not floating in my head.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.100]   So the start, I actually had Jesse load up here the actual document I use.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.800]   This is the actual document I use that just summarizes
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.300]   the high level of my planning system.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   The exact wording I use, you'll notice as we go through this here,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.700]   it's not perfectly written.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.100]   It's not perfectly clear.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.200]   It's for me, but I will go through it.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   All right, so let's start with this.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.800]   All right, for those of you who are watching on the YouTube channel,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.500]   you can see this.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.300]   For those who are listening, I'll narrate it.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.700]   At the top of this document is a title core systems.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.300]   Here's what I say.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.000]   Below are summaries of the three main categories
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   that contain the elements of my core systems.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Core documents, productivity, and discipline.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.100]   So I've broken this document into those three sections.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.200]   Everything related to my core planning system
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.500]   falls under one of those three categories.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.900]   All right, so we start with category number one, core documents.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.100]   There's two.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.000]   Two types of core documents I maintain for my system.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.400]   One is values, a document that, as I say here,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.300]   describes my roles and values by which I try to live.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.900]   And you'll see, like, if you're looking at this online,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.900]   it's important, the wording's kind of weird.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.900]   Because again, it's for me.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.200]   It's not like an essay I'm publishing.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.800]   It's not polished. It doesn't have to be polished.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.400]   I know what it means.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.500]   All right, the other type of documents I keep are my career
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.200]   and personal strategic plans.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.000]   This is me reading the words here.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I have one plan for each of these two parts of my life
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   that lays out my current thoughts, experimental systems,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.100]   and plans for living true to my values.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.300]   So what I'm trying to say there, again,
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.500]   because the writing's not perfect here,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.100]   is like, just what's my plan for pursuing those parts of my life
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.800]   in a way that is true to my values?
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   I then have a note that says,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.900]   sometimes I'll have extended plans
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.400]   that I'll link to from those documents.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.800]   So if there's a particular big project or initiative
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   I'm working on, I might describe that in its own document
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.600]   and link to it from, let's say, the professional strategic plan.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.100]   All right, so those are the three documents
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.100]   at the core of my system.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.200]   My values, here are my values, the roles of my life,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.900]   the values by which I live those roles,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.000]   and then my career and non-career strategic plans.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   I have this subcategory here called maintenance,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.700]   and it talks about how I update these documents.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.600]   And there's three things here,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.400]   and I'll just summarize this at the high level.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   Once a week, I look at my values
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.900]   and create what I call a values plan.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.300]   This is where I emphasize particular values
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.100]   I maybe need to be focusing on or I've fallen off of them.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.800]   Sometimes I'll have some habits in mind
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.100]   to help emphasize a particular value.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.400]   Community connection is important.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.900]   Maybe I need to try for this week
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.100]   calling someone every day, that type of thing.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.900]   So I put this into a kind of a separate,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.100]   what I call a value plan.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.600]   So it's sort of clarifying and calling out
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   what's important in my values for that week.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.800]   I've noted on here that I also include in my value plan
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.700]   best practices for mental health.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.300]   So what am I doing to help keep my mind sharp
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.000]   and healthy and away from anxiety?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.400]   I like to think through my practices,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   have those written down.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.900]   So I try to about once a week to update this values plan.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.700]   All right, for my strategic plans,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.100]   how do I maintain those?
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.000]   Well, once a week, I review them.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.100]   We'll get into that more.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.400]   And then I say here, I can tweak them
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.100]   or change them at any time,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.400]   but I wanna make sure at the very least
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.700]   at the beginning of each new semester, I overhaul it.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.200]   So they're written for a semester at a time,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.500]   but I can tweak them at any time I feel like I should.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.600]   And then finally, I talk about my idea notebook
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.700]   or digital idea storage system.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.500]   So I use Obsidian as well as Moleskine.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.600]   And I keep ideas in there.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   And at the very least, when I do my semester plans
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.200]   or the updates to the strategic plans,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.800]   I'll go through and check those ideas
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.000]   and see if I need to act on any of them.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.900]   All right, so that is the core documents
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.700]   and how I maintain them.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.000]   So quick summary of a document of my values.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.300]   I have a career and personal strategic plan.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.700]   I look at the values once a week
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.200]   and pull out this values plan
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.000]   to just to help keep that at the center of my life.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And I update those strategic plans
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.500]   usually about once a semester.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.900]   All right, the next category for my core systems
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.200]   is productivity.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   So how do I actually organize my time
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.700]   in a way where I am happy with what I'm producing?
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.300]   I break this down into weekly and daily planning.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.500]   So weekly, each week, I build a weekly plan
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.200]   based on a review of my strategic plans,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.900]   my calendar, my task list, and my value plan.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.800]   So I do a weekly plan.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.700]   You've heard me talk about this.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.800]   I don't get into detail here
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.100]   about what goes into the weekly plan
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.800]   because I play it by ear.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.100]   I'm flexible.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.500]   A very complicated week
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.700]   in the middle of an academic semester
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.400]   might have an intricate Jenga game
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.100]   of how I'm gonna make the whole week work.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.300]   A week in July in the middle of the summer
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.000]   might say, "Write!"
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.600]   And that's it.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.100]   So I don't have a set format for that.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.900]   But it's how I make sense of,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.800]   what am I working on this week?
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.100]   What do I need to keep in mind?
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.600]   Are there any habits or heuristics
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.900]   I wanna have on top of mind?
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.200]   Is there any particular things
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.400]   I need to get done this week?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.200]   I need to remember to get it done.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.300]   How am I even just attacking this week?
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.800]   All that's in the weekly plan.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.600]   All right, then each day,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.200]   I review my weekly plan.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.300]   I review my value plan.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.600]   I look at my calendar.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.800]   And if it's a weekday, I make a time block plan.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   So my weekly plan, I check it every day.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.400]   The calendar I check every day.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.200]   Look at my value plan.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.700]   I gotta remember, what am I focusing on?
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.800]   What's important in my values?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.600]   And then I make my time block plan for the day.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.000]   If it's not a weekday, then I do something looser.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.300]   I don't time block plan weekends,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.200]   but you might sketch a quick plan.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Hey, what am I working on today?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.500]   What do I need to remember?
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.000]   That's how my planning works.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.600]   So you see how these things start to connect together.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.200]   The strategic plan influences the weekly plan.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.300]   You look at that weekly plan
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.600]   when you're making your daily plan.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.000]   Your daily plan figures out what you're doing right now.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.600]   So what you're doing right now
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.700]   in this particular system
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.500]   is influenced by your big picture strategic plans,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   but you don't have to think
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.600]   about your big picture strategic plans right now.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.800]   It comes down through these different levels.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.300]   All right, two other pieces to my productivity system.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.400]   Clear work shutdowns with a shutdown complete ritual.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.800]   So you gotta have a clear separation
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.300]   between work and non-work.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.800]   Make a rough but intentional plan
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   for what you wanna do with the rest of your day
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.220]   when you shut down.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.800]   That's my shutdown routine.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.200]   And then full capture.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.000]   David Allen right here.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.600]   Full capture of tasks.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.100]   Make sure at the very least at the shutdown each day,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100]   you process all the tasks that you've captured
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.700]   into the appropriate systems.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.100]   Again, this is all about for me, stress management.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.300]   I don't want open loops.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.000]   I wanna trust if I write something down,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.500]   it will get seen, it will get processed.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.700]   It'll get put on the calendar
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.400]   if it's an appointment or reminder.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.700]   It'll get put on my task list if it's a task.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.400]   It will update my weekly plan
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.000]   if it's a thought about what I need to change for my plan.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And there it will be seen the next day.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It'll be seen in when I look at my weekly plan.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.600]   It'll get reflected in my time block plan.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.100]   It'll be seen when I look at the calendar
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.800]   to make the plan on the relevant day.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.300]   The whole game here is trusting.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.800]   I don't have to keep track of things in my mind.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.700]   I can have this ambitious schema
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.500]   for how I'm trying to advance these big picture goals
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.800]   that have all these moving parts
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   that are rapidly changing in the moment.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   I don't wanna worry about any of it
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.200]   except for what I'm doing in the moment.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   And if it's in the evening,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.100]   then I should just be worried about
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.600]   whatever relaxing thing that I'm trying to do.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   All right, the third category here is discipline.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.200]   So I maintain in my strategic plans
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.700]   an evolving list of core disciplines.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.500]   This might be things about like exercise.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.900]   It might be things about the number of deep work hours
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.740]   you're gonna do each day.
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.060]   It might be something if you're in sales
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.660]   about the number of calls you make every day, whatever.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.800]   But the point is,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.700]   they're disciplines that I try to strictly follow
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.700]   to lay a foundation for a deep life.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.000]   So I think it's important to have hard disciplines.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.100]   I do this, I do that, and I do this other thing.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   And I always do those things.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.500]   These hard boundaries that you follow
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.700]   to help establish a foundation of a deeper life.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.440]   And so that's the third part of my system
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.800]   is having this evolving list of disciplines.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.760]   I talk about here is I often track these with metrics.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.700]   Sometimes I don't.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.900]   So typically, if it's during an academic semester,
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.700]   I'll have a metric code for each of my disciplines
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.440]   where I can keep track of in my time block planner
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   and the metric planning space.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.260]   Did I do this today?
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.100]   Did I do this today?
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.240]   I like to actually see it.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.000]   Other times I take a break from it,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.100]   like in the summer, for example, or over a break,
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.500]   I might, there are periods I'll take a break for it.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.340]   So that is there,
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.440]   but I'm typically collecting these metrics.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.800]   That's it, that's the system.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.460]   That system can support massively complicated ambitions.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.860]   That system can support an incredibly complicated,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.060]   fast moving professional environment
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.140]   where it's very difficult to keep track
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.960]   of all the different things that have to fit together.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.860]   This system will support that.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.860]   This system will support a life outside of work
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.300]   that you can be present and intentional and interesting
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.860]   and pursue things that are interesting to you
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.340]   and develop yourself and develop your mind,
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.340]   develop your relationships, not get lost in work
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.840]   and not get completely overwhelmed with anxiety and stress.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.040]   This system will support your pursuit
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.300]   of living truer to your values, living a good life,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.660]   trying to actually practice and implement the things
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.560]   that make a good life good.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.140]   All of these things are important.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.740]   This simple system that I describe
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.640]   in these three categories of notes,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.660]   in this one document, handles everything.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.960]   And it has in my life for over a decade.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.040]   So all this extra type of stuff I was trying to do
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.160]   in the last few weeks, I realized that all fits in here.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   I know this, I trust this, it's not perfect.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.900]   Some of this stuff is redundant.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.260]   Not all of it makes perfect sense.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.940]   Why is the value plan a separate thing?
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.740]   Shouldn't that be part of the weekly planning?
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.240]   There's all these little legacy incongruities.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.060]   Did I say that right, Jesse?
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.500]   Incongruities.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.140]   Yeah, you said it right, incongruities.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.060]   Let me write that down in my disciplines.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.260]   Say words correctly.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.000]   But it all can be captured here.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.760]   And it's a system that can flex.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.140]   When you're doing complicated things,
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.900]   these documents can get big.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.140]   Your strategic plans get big.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.300]   Your task lists get really big.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.940]   Your calendar is full.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   You have extended plans that you're linking to
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.960]   from your strategic plans.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.440]   Your weekly plans look like epic essays.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.040]   And other periods, you're burnt out,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.700]   you're going through a hard time.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.800]   The system can contract.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.540]   Really just down to the basics, here's my values.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.540]   Gotta get this core things done in my life.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.740]   A lot of like trying to get out of the despair,
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.600]   get out of the depths.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.960]   The system contracts to that as well.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.800]   So it's really a flexible system.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.500]   So this is my public apology to my system.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.400]   Sorry for thinking I could do a little better.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.060]   You've always been what I need in my life.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.100]   This then is my call to you out there in my audience.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.060]   If you don't already have a pretty effective system
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.240]   that captures all of the parts of your life,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.300]   the things that matter to you,
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.340]   professional, non-professional,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.600]   and goes from, captures everything from those big thoughts
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.840]   all the way down to what you're doing today,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.180]   what you're doing tomorrow.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.540]   If you don't have a system like that, try this one.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.200]   Try this one for a month.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.500]   I don't know why it works so well, but it does.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.240]   These parts and the way they mingle
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.780]   and the daily, weekly, and the flexibility,
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.240]   it's a decade's worth of experimentation.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.540]   It does work.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.080]   Give it a try.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.940]   At first, it feels like a lot of moving pieces.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.340]   You get in the rhythm and it actually makes you feel freer.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.480]   And actually makes you feel more relaxed.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   Hey, trust it, the system's got me.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.880]   And in the end, it does produce stuff that matters.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.840]   So that's how I do it.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.680]   I don't know.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   You've heard me talk about this system before.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.520]   - Yeah.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.680]   - It's not too complicated, right?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.980]   I mean, I'm used to it because I've done it for a decade.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.920]   It's like muscle memory for me, but I don't know.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.120]   When I read it from scratch,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.420]   I'm like, do these pieces click?
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.820]   - I think for people who hear it
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.740]   for the first couple of times,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.980]   they just gotta watch this video
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.340]   and then hear you say it a couple of times
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.140]   'cause it does make a lot of sense after.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.680]   And I've been doing it for a couple of years
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.980]   since you started your podcast.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.240]   - Yeah, it's worked for you, right?
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.220]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.520]   And then in terms of the discipline stuff,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.240]   I was thinking about your buddy, Ryan,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.680]   is writing a new book called "Discipline."
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.280]   Have you already read it?
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.120]   - Not yet.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.880]   "Discipline" is something.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.620]   - Yeah.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.440]   - I forgot the word is.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.280]   Yeah, because Ryan's doing a book
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.920]   on each of the four cardinal virtues.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.740]   - Yeah.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.580]   - Yeah.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.420]   Yeah, he has a whole book.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.480]   I'm excited for it.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.320]   - I don't know if he gave you
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.380]   like an advanced copy or something.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.220]   - He will.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.180]   I mean, we share an editor.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.020]   - Yeah.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.120]   - So we tend to see each other's work.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.420]   I talk to him quite a bit.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.740]   That was the last thing, by the way,
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.680]   that was added to my,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.180]   if you look at a decade,
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.740]   the last thing that was added to my system
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.580]   was being explicit about what are the disciplines?
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.440]   What are the, I do these seven things.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.620]   And just being clear about that.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.880]   I was kind of informally doing things,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.140]   like exercise or whatever.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.420]   But for me, if it's not written down,
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.320]   other people don't have this issue,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.640]   but for me, if it's not written down,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.380]   I don't fully trust it and then I get anxious.
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.880]   So I have to have it written down
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.440]   and it all has to connect back.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.140]   It all has to connect back to this root document.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.520]   So there we go.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   - I was listening to an interview with Sisson and Rogan
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   and he, it was actually from 2021.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.420]   - I listened to that one.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.240]   - Yeah.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.520]   I just listened to it like yesterday.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.140]   I just stumbled across it.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.440]   But he was talking about,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.640]   they were talking about discipline
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.120]   and then Rogan was talking about his 15,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.280]   like his 25 minute session in the sauna
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.520]   and then 15 minutes, like the last 10 minutes,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.620]   he's got this breathing routine.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.780]   If he thinks about anything else,
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.580]   he adds like an extra breath.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.520]   - But you got, if you ever heard Joe Rogan
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.580]   talk to Laird Hamilton,
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.520]   I don't know, he was on the show a couple of years ago.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.440]   You know Laird Hamilton, right?
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.280]   - Yeah.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.120]   - Laird Hamilton fan.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.040]   And Rogan, I guess, was talking about his,
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.080]   like I do this like hardcore sauna thing.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.480]   And Laird was like, hold my beer.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.220]   Laird is like insane.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.920]   That guy is so interesting.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.320]   - He swims with like dumbbells.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.280]   - He swims with dumbbells.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.340]   He has a giant sauna.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.740]   And so Rogan's like, man,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.140]   I stay in my sauna for like 15 minutes.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.980]   - 25 minutes.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.940]   - 25 minutes, yeah.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.920]   Laird Hamilton brings an assault bike into the sauna,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.380]   which for people who don't know,
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.980]   is like the hardest single piece of, right?
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.820]   Exercise equipment.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.480]   It's like you do your arms and your legs and resistance.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.720]   You're like mountain climbing.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.680]   I don't know, it's impossible, right?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.240]   It's like one of the hardest single exercise you can do.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.780]   He brings one of those into a giant barrel sauna
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.220]   and does it and then gets into an ice bath.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.780]   So, you know,
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.380]   his discipline document is more impressive than mine.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.240]   (upbeat music)
