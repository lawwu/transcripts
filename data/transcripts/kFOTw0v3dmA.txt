[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Well, Merry Christmas to all of the
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.840]   Ask Pastor John podcast listeners out there.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.700]   On behalf of John Piper and the whole team
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.860]   at Desiring God, we pray that your Christmas is filled
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.260]   with the glorious beauty of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.540]   And thank you for joining us for another year
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.460]   on the podcast.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820]   Thanks for all the great questions and your engagement.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.780]   We can't do this podcast without you.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.360]   Well, the great Christmas hymn, Joy to the World,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.220]   is a celebration of the glory of our sovereign Savior
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.060]   and the global joy that he brought in his birth
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.520]   in the little town of Bethlehem.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   That same hymn calls for every heart to prepare him room.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.260]   What's that mean exactly, to receive Christ?
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.940]   That's the question Pastor John took up in his 1986 sermon,
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.300]   Preparing to Receive Christ.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.300]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.300]   - We regard divine things as stupid, folly.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:13.200]   Let me bring it into the Christmas setting.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   By nature, as flesh and blood, we recoil
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.900]   at the humiliating implications of Christmas.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.420]   And therefore, we redesign Christmas.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.840]   Christmas is humiliating because it means I'm cursed
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.740]   and need a Savior.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.740]   Christmas means that I am lost and I need a shepherd.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.460]   It means I'm sick and I need a physician.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.960]   It means I'm a rebel and I need a reconciler.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.340]   And it means I'm dirty and I need a purifier.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.900]   Now, when that message about Christmas is heralded,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   the natural man or flesh and blood hates it so much
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.220]   that it becomes blind to it, to protect itself from it.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.940]   And then redesigns Christmas in a secular way
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.440]   to cope with it.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.740]   Why does the human heart not run to the light
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.960]   when the light comes into the world?
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.080]   Jesus told us why in John 3:19.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.880]   He said, "Light has come into the world,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   "but men loved darkness rather than light."
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.600]   They loved darkness.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.780]   No person in the world is spiritually blind
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.700]   against His will.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.460]   You got that now?
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.720]   Put that in your computer
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.660]   and processing what you hear from this pulpit.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660]   No person in the world is spiritually blind
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.600]   against His will.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.620]   Spiritual blindness is hate of the light.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.940]   Spiritual blindness is the recoiling from the light
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.680]   and the loving and the embracing of the dark.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   And loving and embracing is an act of the will.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.720]   No one is blind against His will.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   The will is corrupt in blindness.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   If any of you or I have seen the sun
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.020]   for who He is, something more than flesh and blood
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.820]   has been at work in our lives.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.220]   Amen?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.060]   What is it?
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060]   Matthew 16, 17, "My Father in heaven
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.620]   "has revealed this to you."
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.240]   Now the question is, how?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.740]   Because all of us want to affirm what the Bible says.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.200]   We want to say, "Yes, yes."
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   But how?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.140]   What was it like?
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.140]   I'm not sure what to point to in my experience.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.780]   I know I'm saved.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.380]   I believe Jesus.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.220]   I trust Him.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.040]   I love Him.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.360]   I make every effort to obey.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.580]   I confess when I sin.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.980]   But I can't remember that ever happening to me.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.420]   So I want to ask with you, what's it?
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.540]   What is it?
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.720]   What was it like for Peter and for us?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.840]   Was it in a dream where God Almighty,
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.860]   the Father comes to you and says,
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.480]   "When you wake up, read the Word
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.820]   "and what you see there of Christ, believe it, it's true."
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.460]   Or was it perhaps that you were reading a verse
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.180]   about the divinity of Christ and it thundered outside.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.000]   "Whoa, that's a sign that this is true.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.060]   "He is God."
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.060]   Or many other such external constraints on your will.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.740]   If so, if that's what you think it means
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.740]   or has happened to you, be very suspicious of this.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.940]   Why?
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.740]   Because it doesn't honor Christ.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.300]   If Christ comes and knocks on your door
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.800]   and you open the door and you look at Him,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.640]   just an ordinary man, nobody attractive,
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.980]   nobody marvelous, nobody beautiful, nobody divine,
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.140]   nobody good enough to rip you away from your sins,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.300]   nobody great to fall on your face and kiss His feet,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.940]   but then the phone rings and you pick up the phone
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.100]   and it says, "Hello, this is God Almighty, the Father.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.740]   "That's my son at your door, let him in."
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.140]   And you, "Whew, okay, okay."
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.280]   And you go, "Come on in, Jesus.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.140]   "You may come into my life."
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.060]   Sure, I don't want to go to hell.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.480]   You can't be saved if that's the way
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.880]   you welcome Jesus into your life.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.600]   If you open the door and you saw nothing beautiful,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.240]   nothing glorious, nothing attractive,
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.080]   nothing matchless, nothing to free you from your sins,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.680]   but under someone's constraint, you said,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.620]   "Well, this is what you're supposed to do.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.420]   "You go to church and you call Him God
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.520]   "and you pray to receive Him."
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.160]   You're not saved.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.320]   Christ is not honored like that.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.400]   There's no glory for Christ in that.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.080]   Where is another illustration where Jesus expects somebody
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.600]   to recognize Him for who He is?
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   And how does He expect that person to recognize Him?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.120]   And then we'll get insight into how God reveals the Son.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.960]   All right?
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.800]   The person is John the Baptist.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.640]   Where is he?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.800]   He's in jail.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.560]   And he's starting to doubt.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   Don't condemn yourself for doubting.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   Jesus called John the Baptist the greatest of men.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   The greatest man born of woman was doubting in His last hours.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.960]   However, he didn't sink into despair.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.080]   He sent disciples to Jesus and He asks Him,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.880]   "Are You He who is to come or shall we look for another?"
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.240]   Now, what's that question mean?
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.920]   That question means, "Are You the Messiah?"
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.760]   Now, what has Jesus just told Peter about how to find out if He's the Messiah?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   Get a revelation from God, right?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.120]   So what Jesus says to these disciples is,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.840]   "You go back, tell John to get down on his knees
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.400]   "and ask for a revelation from God, right?"
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.920]   Wrong.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.320]   This is very important.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.680]   How does Jesus help this man in desperate torment
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.360]   about whether He is the Christ?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.560]   "Go tell John what you hear and see."
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.040]   "The blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.280]   "lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.600]   "the dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.920]   "and blessed is He who takes no offense at me."
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   Now, if you can only recognize the Son for who He really is
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.240]   by a revelation from the Father,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.520]   why does Jesus answer this man's desperate, doubting question
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.080]   by sending a human report of the deeds and words of Jesus?
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.520]   Here's the answer, as far as I can see.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.480]   The indispensable work of God the Father
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.320]   in the life of John, Peter, you and me,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.720]   the indispensable, revealing work of God the Father
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.800]   is not, I repeat, is not an adding to us
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.720]   of information that we can't see in Jesus.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   Rather, the indispensable work of God the Father
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   revealing the Son is the opening of the eyes of our heart
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.520]   to see Him for who He really is.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.200]   At the door.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.520]   So that when we welcome Him,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.680]   He's honored because we have fallen on our face.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   We have kissed His feet, we've seen His glory,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.640]   and when He sits on our couch,
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.520]   it's not because of any authoritative constraint over the phone,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.560]   it's because He's real.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.200]   He's God. He's glorious.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.760]   He's my treasure. He satisfies.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.280]   Has God the Father Almighty revealed the Son to you?
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.960]   How does it happen?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.400]   It happens along the lines of the written, inspired Word of God.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.160]   So what should you do this Advent season
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.680]   to prepare to receive Christ for who He really is?
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.160]   Two simple things, and they are simple.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.200]   The Gospel is wonderfully simple.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.080]   Number one, look. Look. Look at Jesus.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.280]   Consider Jesus.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.040]   Meditate on Jesus.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.800]   Fix your sights on Jesus.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.680]   Open the Bible to Luke and read it again and again and again and again this Advent season.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.600]   Read a Gospel a day if you have to, if you think you're outside Christ.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.520]   Expose yourself to Jesus.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.040]   And then secondly, pray.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.440]   "Open my eyes, Father, that I might behold the beauty of Christ."
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.240]   Because God loves to open the eyes of people who are looking at Jesus.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.120]   Because then, when their eyes are opened,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   they see Him and He gets the glory.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.120]   They get the salvation.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.520]   And this could be the greatest Advent season of your life.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.600]   Amen. Those words are still true.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.200]   And if you haven't, embrace this Christ.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.120]   He is extraordinary. He is marvelous. He is divine.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.320]   He is beautiful enough to rip you away from your sins.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.440]   He's glorious enough for all of us to fall on our faces before Him,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.120]   to kiss His feet, and to anoint Him with oil.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.640]   He is, in Himself, that precious.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   Such a good word for all of us this Christmas.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.280]   This clip was pulled from John Piper's 1986 sermon, "Preparing to Receive Christ."
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.040]   Well, I hope you enjoy what remains of your Christmas break.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.040]   We're back on Friday, and many of you will be back to work.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   We'll look at the pressures of Silicon Valley on tech professionals
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.040]   and ask whether or not Christlikeness can survive in an environment
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.440]   that sees the virtues of Christ to be weaknesses.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.040]   Interesting.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.440]   That's on Friday. Again, Merry Christmas.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.640]   Thank you for joining us for another year on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.240]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on Friday.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:08.200]   [Silence]
