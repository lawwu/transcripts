[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   So Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi, folks.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:12.800]   So by way of introduction, I want to just sort of tell the story of how this panel happened.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.060]   It arose out of almost a throwaway comment that Jason made on an episode of the pod where he was
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.880]   talking about, you know, lining up speakers for this event. And he said that, you know,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   he was having a hard time getting liberals and all he could find were like right-wingers
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.100]   like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi. And in terms of just to explain their backgrounds a
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.320]   little bit, you know, Matt used to be the, they're both independent journalists who write phenomenal
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.440]   columns on Substack and all of you should check it out and subscribe. And by the way, they also do
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.620]   call-in shows on a phenomenal podcasting platform that you should all check out.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:02.920]   But Matt was sort of like the left-wing firebrand, sort of populist firebrand on writing for
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.160]   Rolling Stone, who back in 2009 was asking the question, why the people who caused the great
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.200]   financial crisis, why no one was going to jail. And Glenn, you know, broke the Snowden story
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.840]   about how the government was engaging in mass surveillance on all of us and raising questions
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.260]   about the infringement of our civil liberties.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.160]   So, you know, both these guys have, I'd say, you know, well-established bona fides, you know,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.440]   used to be considered left-wing sort of liberal bona fides, but now today somehow they've been
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   read out of what you would call liberalism today. And so that comment that Jason made sort of,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.520]   I think there's so much to unpack there on how that happened. What does liberalism today mean
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.140]   if it doesn't?
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.240]   If it doesn't, then what does it mean if it doesn't?
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.920]   If it doesn't include you guys. And so that, I mean, maybe that's the place to start is trying
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.800]   to understand what has happened in our politics that makes you guys not liberal anymore. And
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.980]   what is liberalism? And then what is conservatism? And are we even thinking about the political
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.860]   divide in our country the right way if left versus right doesn't really capture it anymore?
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.960]   So that was sort of the starting point for this.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   Who wants to go next?
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.060]   Who wants to just react to anything I just said?
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.020]   Yeah, well, first of all, it's, of course, very gratifying to realize that your
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.020]   attendance at a conference is due to a throwaway line from Jason. So
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.320]   super honored to hear that. That's the reason why we were invited.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.800]   queen yeah you know it's interesting i guess we join a long list of other far-right luminaries
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.760]   like russell brand who has spent the last 15 years as one of the most vocal devotees
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.240]   to the socialist jeremy corbyn he's now also on the right and joe rogan who just 18 months ago
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.720]   said to millions of people that his favorite candidate running for president was bernie
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.960]   sanders the socialist left-wing candidate from vermont and even now elon musk who voted for
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.880]   barack obama in 2012 over mitt romney and is one of the largest donors to the aclu sometimes somehow
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.600]   he's also on the far right so in some sense it's just become a kind of punishing label that's
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.080]   designed to stigmatize or demonize anybody who in any way dissents from or diverges from liberal
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   orthodoxy
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.280]   it's just kind of an enforcement or coercive label that has no meaning just bereft of any
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.200]   actual substance but i think there's a broader dynamic underneath it all which is
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.320]   that you know it is true that every five years ten years what was once an issue at the forefront
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.040]   of our debates goes to the background and other issues go to the forefront so ten years ago we
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.560]   were spending a lot of time debating things like obama's drone program where
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.200]   guantanamo not being closed um or as you said the work matt was doing on you know derivatives and
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.960]   the fraud on wall street we don't talk much about that anymore we spend a lot of time now talking
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.480]   instead about whether the internet should be this instrument of censorship and information control
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.240]   whether we should trust the u.s security state to dictate what is and is not disinformation
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.520]   uh whether we should be involved in very similar kinds of proxy wars like we spent the cold war
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.760]   doing over places like ukraine and so in one way it's natural that political alliances shift as
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.640]   different issues go to the fore and alliances change as a result but i think something much
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.320]   more important is that liberalism itself has changed largely by virtue of donald trump
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.720]   because liberals as a defining view maybe as an overarching view maybe maybe democrats
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   are not liberal yeah by liberals i just mean kind of the mainstream wing of the democratic party
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.880]   the way hillary you know hillary clinton calls herself progressive so again illustrating the
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   bankruptcy of these terms but by liberals i just mean kind of like the nancy pelosi barack obama
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.560]   hillary clinton chuck schumer wing have come to believe that the overarching way to understand
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.720]   politics is that there's one primary menace and risk to the united states which is donald trump
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.640]   his movement in the republican party and it's not just that they have a bad ideology
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.680]   but that they're actual fascists trying to instill a white nationalist dictatorship and if you
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.320]   actually believe that if that's something that you genuinely believe on some level it becomes
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.560]   rational to start embracing authoritarian uh methods of resisting that of combating that
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.920]   censoring um you know using uh due process free processes to punish people and deprive them of
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.080]   their liberty and i think anytime a political movement gets convinced that it is no longer
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.480]   involved in the democratic process it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.800]   not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.360]   political debate but a historic war between pure good and pure evil it starts to turn to
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.240]   authoritarian tactics to win because it believes that's justified or even necessary and those
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.920]   authority authoritarian toxic happens to be the ones that the left traditionally had opposed and
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   now are embracing and i guess matt and i didn't decide that we were going to change our views of
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.760]   the last 30 years about these issues and that has caused this organic breach not just between us two
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.040]   you know others like us and as i said anyone who finds themselves outside of liberal orthodoxy
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.160]   automatically receives the far-right label yeah um first of all i agree with all that and um
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.720]   you know for me it's even funnier because uh prior to 2008 i would say that
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.840]   um i was sort of like the triumph the insolent comic dog of journalism
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.680]   basically my job at rolling stone was to throw off one-liners about republicans
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.840]   uh my editors almost never sent me to a democratic function because they didn't want me
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.440]   describing those events in in a colorful way let's put it that way so i got i got sent to a
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.240]   lot of events um where people like sarah palin or fred thompson or mike huckabee would be speaking
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.040]   i actually won a national magazine award for a column about huckabee called my favorite nut job
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.000]   and um
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   but then after 2008 after obama got elected they assigned me to do a story one story about
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.800]   the 2008 financial crisis essentially with the idea of explaining it in terms that people who
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   are not financial professionals could understand so i did one story that was really about aig and
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:12.840]   we got this overwhelming response that we'd never gotten before from readers we'd never uh heard of
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.520]   uh heard from before and that led to me doing eight years of work instead of one
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:26.120]   story and one of the themes that came out of that reporting was that
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   in the sort of post bailout economy the wealth gap was widening and um you know i just read a
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:41.960]   statistic that said that uh during the obama years uh the bottom 99 saw their average wealth decrease
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:51.000]   by 3900 whereas the top one percent saw its wealth increase by an average of 4.9 million dollars
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.680]   and so you know i didn't make that much that big of a deal of this in my reporting but when
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:06.520]   um 2016 came around um yeah in covering both the trump and sanders campaigns
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   uh it was abundantly clear that this widening wealth gap and
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.320]   the stress that it had placed on uh populations on both the left and the right was a significant
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   factor uh in this race and when i started to write this in the context of covering trump rather than
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.040]   just doing the usual thing of tossing off insults about the candidate which is easy enough to do
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.760]   with trump uh i started to say things like well there are reasons why he's succeeding he's
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.360]   attracting crowds that are uh you know he's not going to be able to get to the top of the list
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:48.220]   not just the usual Republican crowds, there are former union members here. They
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:54.000]   have a lot in common with the crowds who show up at Bernie Sanders events and it
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.420]   started to notice a distinctly unpleasant reaction from people inside
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.880]   the business where it quickly became taboo to explain Donald Trump in any way
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.480]   other than this is a white supremacist movement and he's appealing to you know
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.760]   the lowest common denominator through that kind of messaging. Now I happen to
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.260]   believe that that's that was part of certainly part of what was going on but
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.860]   it wasn't the whole explanation but I think Trump is is the dividing line of
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.220]   what you're talking about. If you don't have, if you have a nuanced
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.380]   explanation for Donald Trump
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.420]   then you can't be part of the club anymore because the the dominant
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:48.980]   narrative requires that he be cartoonized you know in the same way
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.800]   that we used to do it with figures like Saddam Hussein or Putin now you know we
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:00.440]   call it the Hitler of the Month Club. If you're not willing to just do that
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   and if you try to actually explain what where all these voters coming from why
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.180]   are they upset what went wrong that this would happen. Also known as the purpose
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.460]   of journalism. Yeah exactly right which is supposed to be our job.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:27.540]   I think both of us quickly learned that there that was not welcome and you know
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.220]   after Trump got elected I think that that instinct to crowd out anyone who was
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:40.080]   interested in going there and trying to figure out what was wrong that it caused
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.140]   2016 you know suddenly became an apostate and by the way that includes
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.800]   some politicians like you know Bernie Sanders I think was one of the people
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:56.880]   who was very interested in examining what happened in 2016 and and I think
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.580]   that's one of the reasons why there was such a violent reaction to his candidacy
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.080]   in both 2016 and 2020.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.780]   So for me I think that's the dividing line it's not like something's changed so
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:17.800]   much with liberalism or it's it's really about Trump I think and and journalism
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.640]   has adjusted it is you know we've we've gone from being people whose primary job
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.700]   is to be curious about why things happen to being advocates who believe that you
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.080]   know certain people have to be opposed at all costs and even if that cost is a
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.980]   little bit of the truth or a lot of it.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:44.400]   So having ripped the umpire jersey off their backs to basically stop the Trump menace it seems like
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.060]   journalism can't now go back to even a pretense of neutrality is that so it basically has happened now?
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.820]   I think so I think and I think you see that in in what happened what's happening with the
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:03.940]   ratings that at cable stations you know I warned about this in 2016 and I wrote a column in the
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:12.440]   in that summer saying that a model where basically right-wing media wrote about the evils of the
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.960]   Democratic Party and blue media wrote about the evils of the Republican Party that that just
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:26.560]   wouldn't work audience wise because audiences would no longer trust either source to be objective and
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.800]   to report the facts and I think that's where we are now like we see the declining the declining ratings
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:42.680]   of companies like CNN and MSNBC which were previously thought of as more kind of down the road down the
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:48.500]   middle of the road news agencies and now are thought of as politicized and they're having a terrible
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:56.360]   trouble kind of going back because once you cross that line into politics you can't get your reputation
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.740]   back as a neutral fact finder anymore.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.660]   Yeah I think people forget what things were like before Trump since he's such a
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:10.680]   you know kind of ubiquitous presence as Matt was saying and for me I you know he also defines and
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.160]   is responsible for most of the changes we're discussing but back in 2015 most of these news
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:22.940]   organizations were on the brink of collapse every MSNBC host was on the verge of being fired you know
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.340]   a couple of months away from being fired because nobody was watching the New York Times had severe
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.520]   financial difficulty there was talk about whether they would have to declare bankruptcy because their
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:41.500]   bond sheet was so drowning in debt and Trump saved them all he saved the entire industry they all
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:49.540]   owed their jobs their second homes the ability to pay off their IRS debt to Donald Trump because you
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.380]   can trace his emergence on the scene to when people started watching those programs again and
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:15:03.380]   what they did was they rebranded as the resistance to Donald Trump and they sacrificed any even pretense of
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:09.380]   journalistic function they know if you and you just look at polling data that 95 of the people
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:15.860]   who watch msnbc and 93 of the people who read the new york times and trust it identify as democrats
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.780]   um so there's a completely polarized media you know one of the kind of non-media examples is
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.060]   the aclu there was an article in 2015 in the aclu about the aclu and the washington post
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.060]   that they were mass layoff had to engage in mass layoffs of their stop because they had no money
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.900]   trump gets inaugurated they start tweeting you know every day we'll see you in court mr trump
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:44.580]   and like stimulating the you know kind of g zones of every liberal and suddenly they're drowning in
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:50.020]   money like millions and millions of dollars you know like building like the aclu you know it's
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.740]   always financially struggled and as a result they're completely captive now to that kind
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:00.660]   of an audience you know i have a friend i guess i had a friend um at who was a who's a
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   host of an msnbc and he was like you know what's the problem with the money that's going to be
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   in the bank and he's like well you know what's the problem with the money that's going to be in the
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   bank and he's like well you know what's the problem with the money that's going to be in the bank
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   and he's like well you know what's the problem with the money that's going to be in the bank
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:07.140]   a host of an msnbc show and they once told me that they don't get show by show ratings they get
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:14.340]   segment by segment ratings and ever since trump they told me the minute you put on anybody who's
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.140]   critical of the democratic party anyway you can just see the audience completely disappear which
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.260]   you can imagine a person in that position what an enforcement mechanism that is to know that they
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.300]   have a salary and kids and the need to pay for college and their mortgage and they know if they
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   do anything that deviates from the money that they're getting they're going to be in the bank
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.620]   do anything that deviates at all from democratic party doctrine they're going to lose their
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.140]   audience the new york times knows that the aclu knows that and so yeah i think they're all not
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.740]   it's not just that they've lost their credibility and can't get it back which is absolutely true as
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:48.980]   matt said it's also that they're now captive to this kind of uh prison cell that they built for
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.460]   themselves chasing the sugar high that trump provided just really quickly i gotta tell a story
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.220]   in the middle of all this phenomenon reporters were arguing about
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:05.140]   whether or not we should be covering him less because maybe we had helped him get the nomination
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.580]   you know i covered trump's campaign and this was a a hot topic and on the bus at the time
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:16.100]   but then it was sort of decided that now he's just making us all so much money let's just let's just
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:25.780]   go with it and uh i remember being in indianapolis when trump sewed up the um the nomination by
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.060]   beating cruise who still had a mathematical chance of winning i think it was in the mid 90s i think it
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:35.060]   was a good thing i guess if he had done well there but trump if you remember during that particular
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:44.740]   race accused cruise of being the zodiac killer uh uh which was hilarious because cruise was born two
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:52.180]   years after the killings ended so but there was one reporter i know who who actually uh got the
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.700]   nerve up to ask i i believe it was i believe it was cruise's wife about about the the accusation of the
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:00.580]   like what do you have to say to the idea that uh you know that you know your your husband is this
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:05.940]   is the zodiac killer and he's telling me the story about this afterwards and he goes you know i felt
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:13.220]   so dirty doing it but i also felt so great so i think that's where they were they were in that
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:20.660]   space for a long time the media the media and trump had a weird codependent relationship um just
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.540]   in terms of trying to appeal to people out there who may not be trump fans or to get through them
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.900]   on this point it just seems to me that when you lose an election anytime and you lose an election
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:37.300]   as a party you need to analyze what went wrong and especially when the candidate is a complete
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:43.460]   political novice with no you know no prior experience and had so many attributes that
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.740]   historically were people who were not interested in the political world and so i think that's
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.660]   what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.380]   now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.380]   in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.620]   what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.980]   and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.300]   the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.860]   what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.340]   and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's what's happening in
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.340]   the world right now and i think that's what's happening in the world right now and i think that's
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.540]   gotten out of afghanistan yet but it was on its way to being a historic 20-year failure
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.700]   he shattered the republican party with that message no more bushes he then took the issue
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:28.660]   of trade and basically broke down the democrats blue wall in the rust belt by basically pointing
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.740]   out the ways that our trade our bipartisan trade policy just like our bipartisan uh foreign you
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.620]   know our war policy had led to uh the de-industrialization of the of the rust belt
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.660]   and then he also used the immigrant the uh the issue of immigration which was sort of closely
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:52.100]   related to that idea of creating wage pressure on the working class so you would think that having
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:58.260]   rode those issues all the way to the white house that there would be some sort of reappraisal and
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.020]   instead it seems like what the elite did to protect itself was create these mythologies
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:11.060]   that trump somehow got elected not because the people of the country were fed up with the way
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.300]   that it had been run for 20 years by both parties but rather because the russians somehow were behind
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.220]   it or uh or the country was shot through with white supremacy and that somehow explained it
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:32.340]   um and so we never really got a true uh sort of accounting or reappraisal of what trump's election
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:40.100]   meant and instead the media turned to like this hysteria this mode that we're not even out of yet
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.340]   your reactions to that no i think you know it's one of the most amazing things about the 2016
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.140]   election which is first of all you know in a lot of ways barack obama being this kind of
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.740]   once in a generation political talent papered over the the incredibly serious systemic problems
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:02.260]   the democrats had even while he was being re-elected underneath obama and all his glitter and
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.100]   glamour the democratic party was collapsing they were losing state houses and congressional seats
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:14.900]   and governorships all over the country and the reason for that is the anger the growing anger
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:20.100]   with the neoliberal policies that the democratic party in the early 1990s had decided to embrace
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.460]   and move the working-class politics for which they had always been known the kind of clintonite
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.060]   pronouncement that the democratic party needs to start embracing corporate america instead of unions
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.860]   that it needs to move much closer to these polit this politics that says you know we're going to
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:42.420]   encourage um corporate america we're going to embrace the pentagon and all of that and it
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.060]   radically changed the the democratic party into this party of technocracy and the elites
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:56.340]   culminating with the obama presidency and the only what is amazing is in 2016 the democrats lost the
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.980]   white house to a game show host and so you know what's amazing about that is that the
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.380]   democratic party was the only one that was going to be able to do anything on its own and so you
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.700]   would think they would wonder why that happened as you were saying right you would think they would
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:17.140]   wonder what is it about us that caused us to lose to donald trump and instead they invented this long
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.940]   list of people that they decided were to blame instead vladimir putin principally wikileaks
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.820]   jill stein for having the audacity to continue to run for president you know a whole long list of
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.820]   villains essentially everybody except themselves and the people who are responsible for it
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.220]   and i think that's what's so amazing about this is that the only reason that the president won
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.500]   was because the country is radically and fundamentally racist and he capitalized on that
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:46.900]   and what's so amazing about that is there are literally millions of voters in excess of 10
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:53.060]   million depending on how you count but definitely in excess of 10 million voters who twice voted for
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:59.940]   barack obama in 2008 and 12 and then in 2016 voted for donald trump
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:07.700]   there are increasing numbers of non-white voters all over the country moving to the republican party
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.100]   under trump and voting increasingly for trump he had a larger share of black voters latino voters
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.060]   asian american voters than any republican candidate in decades and those trends are only
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   worsening and so you have this media that has no interest in and no ability to understand how the
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.700]   majority of people in the united states are going to vote for him and that's what's so amazing about it
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.900]   so i'm going to ask you to give us a little bit of background on that and then i'll give you a little bit of the
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.900]   context of what you said about the white people and what you said about the white people in the
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.780]   united states and i think that's a really important thing about what you said about the white people
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.460]   and the white people in the united states as well and i think that's very important because the white
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.620]   people are very well represented in the white people and i think that's the key to that is that
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.940]   the white people are very well represented in the white people and i think that's the key to that is
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.700]   that the white people are very well represented in the white people and i think that's the key to that
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.620]   and i think that's the key to that is that they're very well represented in the white people and i
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.060]   think that's the key to that is that they're very well represented in the white people and i think that's
