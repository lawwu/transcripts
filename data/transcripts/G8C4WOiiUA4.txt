[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   So in the old days, 10, 20 years ago,
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.620]   we would just have a resume that we would submit
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.640]   and it would be tossed into the trash, right?
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.380]   Seven seconds people spend on a resume and that's it.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.600]   Nowadays, everybody Googles who you are, what you do,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.960]   what you stand for, what you believe in.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.720]   And so having your website is vital.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520]   And thinking about your brand is also vital.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   If you want a job, if you want to do new things.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.560]   I think everybody needs to plant their flag on the internet
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.120]   and own their domain,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.340]   instead of letting a social media company own you.
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.040]   Look, if you write content on Twitter, Facebook, whatever,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.120]   they own you, they have the content
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360]   and they're getting rich, right?
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.040]   You are helping them get rich.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840]   Instead, why don't you get yourself rich
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.960]   by planting your own flag, branding yourself online
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.600]   and sharing with the world what you stand for.
