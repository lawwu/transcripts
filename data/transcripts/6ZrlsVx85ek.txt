[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.140]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.900]   Today, we are discussing hair.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.580]   Hair is a topic that occupies the minds of many people.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.860]   There are people that are losing their hair
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.540]   and want to halt or reverse that loss of hair.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.580]   And today we will talk about all the ways
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.220]   that science has taught us we can slow
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.060]   or even reverse hair loss.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.340]   I confess that researching today's topic
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.240]   was a particular joy for me,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.840]   not because I'm obsessed with hair,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.800]   mine or the hair of others,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.120]   but because hair turns out to be fascinating
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.140]   from the perspective of cellular biology and stem cells,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.700]   which is a topic that I've long been interested in
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.340]   and that for much of my career,
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.200]   I've focused on in the context of development.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.820]   So when your brain and your nervous system develop,
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.740]   it develops from a small batch of cells
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.060]   that turns into many, many trillions of cells.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.220]   And it does that by cell replication,
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.060]   something that we call the cell cycle.
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460]   And we'll talk a little bit about this
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.380]   and so-called mitosis today.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.660]   I promise not to get into too much detail,
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.660]   but what makes hair so very interesting
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.220]   from a biological standpoint is that every hair,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.140]   every single individual strand of hair
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.260]   has its own little stem cell niche,
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.100]   meaning its own little pocket down there in the follicle
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.580]   in which specific stem cells give rise to those hairs
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.460]   for different durations of time, depending on the hair,
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980]   where it is on your body, et cetera.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.860]   So for instance, the hairs on your head
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.700]   will undergo ongoing growth for four to six
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.280]   or even eight years.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.660]   So were you to not cut your hair,
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.000]   it would continue to grow.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400]   One single hair would continue to grow.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.020]   I guess we could say all the hairs will continue to grow
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.220]   for up to eight years.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.920]   That is very different from, for instance, your eyebrows,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.620]   which have a much shorter period of hair growth
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.240]   lasting on the order of months.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.540]   That's why you don't see people with eyebrows
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.940]   that extend down to their waist,
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.500]   but you can see people with hair on their head
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.880]   that extends down to their waist if they don't cut it.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   Now that discrepancy illustrates for us
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.900]   just how incredible hair follicles
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.340]   and the stem cells that reside within hairs are
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.900]   and their enormous potential to give rise
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   to these things that we call hairs,
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780]   which are simply proteins of varying length.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.220]   So today we are going to address
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.740]   what determines the length of a hair
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.820]   or rather what determines how long a hair continues to grow
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.620]   before it ceases growing and eventually falls out.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.940]   We're going to talk about what regulates those stem cells,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.020]   what allows them to continue to produce hair
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.420]   or cease producing hair.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.940]   And as we do that, you will learn all the biology
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.720]   in clear, simple terms, regardless of your background,
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660]   that will really set the stage for understanding
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.540]   what we'll also talk about,
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.540]   which is how to slow hair loss or halt hair loss entirely,
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.980]   or even reverse hair loss.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.060]   So we will talk about hormone-related hair loss
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.420]   in both men and women.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.160]   We will talk about some of the mechanical
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220]   and stress-related influences on hair loss.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.180]   And we will talk about the chemical and mechanical approaches
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.860]   to halting and reversing hair loss,
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   everything from minoxidil to dutasteride to ketoconazole
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.100]   to microneedling to thyroid, estrogen, IGF-1 pathways.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.860]   Again, all made very clear,
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.860]   regardless of whether or not you have
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.440]   a background in biology or not.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.300]   I will also dispel some of the common myths
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.340]   about balding and hair replacement.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.660]   If you've heard, for instance,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.860]   that you inherit your patterns of balding
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.980]   from your mother's father, that is not true.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.240]   Although it is true that you do inherit certain genes
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.040]   that influence whether or not you have a predisposition
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   to balding in particular parts of your head,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320]   and believe it or not, even particular parts of your body.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.620]   But it is not the case that you can simply find a photo
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.380]   of your mother's father, say at age 50 or age 60 or 75,
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.540]   and determine whether or not you'll have
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.260]   the exact same pattern of hair loss.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.380]   So that's a myth that I'd like to dispel right here and now,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.460]   and I will dispel some of the other myths about hair loss,
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.540]   hair replacement, and hair regrowth as well.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.140]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.760]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.900]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.380]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.760]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.960]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.560]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.560]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.640]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.380]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.640]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.580]   Helix understands that everybody's sleep needs
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.920]   are slightly different.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.460]   So if you go to their website, you can take a brief quiz,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.420]   and that quiz will ask you questions such as,
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.540]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.980]   Maybe you don't know, which is fine.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.780]   You can simply answer, I don't know.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.260]   Or do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.980]   Helix takes those answers and then matches you to a mattress
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.740]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.820]   So for me, it matched me to the Dusk, a D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.380]   and I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.820]   for over two years now, and my sleep has been better
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.620]   than it ever was previously.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.700]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.120]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.920]   take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.400]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.320]   You'll also get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.780]   and two free pillows.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.880]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.080]   and you get to try out their mattress
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.020]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.920]   They'll even pick it up for you
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.320]   if you don't love the mattress, but I think you will.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.180]   I certainly love mine.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.360]   Again, if you're interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.440]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.340]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.620]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.040]   I want to be very clear that I, like most people,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.480]   have heard of the ketogenic diet,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.580]   but I, like most people, do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.280]   That is, I'm not in ketosis.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.600]   However, most people don't realize that you can still benefit
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.320]   from increasing your blood ketones,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.140]   which is what HVMN Ketone IQ does.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.520]   I take ketone IQ prior to doing
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.640]   really focused cognitive work.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.020]   So I take it once in the afternoon,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.320]   anytime I'm going to prepare for a podcast or do a podcast,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.560]   or if I'm going to do some research or focus on a grant,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.000]   anything that requires a high level of cognitive demand,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.620]   and that's because ketones are the brain's preferred use
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.480]   of fuel, even if you're not following a ketogenic diet.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   I sometimes also use ketone IQ prior to workouts,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.080]   either resistance training workouts
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.420]   or endurance workouts, such as running.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.880]   Again, that's because ketone IQ, by raising blood ketones,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.700]   is really a brain fuel.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.720]   If you're interested in trying ketone IQ,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.000]   go to hvmn.com and use the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.440]   Again, that's hvmn.com and use the code Huberman
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.920]   to get 20% off.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that were designed
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.440]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.120]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.440]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.300]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.880]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.080]   for you to be able to see clearly throughout the day.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.960]   So for instance, when you go from a shady area
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.240]   to a well-lit area, your brain and eyes
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.100]   have to make a bunch of different adjustments
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.960]   that eyeglasses of the conventional type
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.680]   don't always compensate for.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.040]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses compensate
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.300]   for those sorts of changes and all the sorts of changes
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.000]   that your visual system has to contend with,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.140]   so you always see things with crystal clarity.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.340]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.440]   from Stanford, and initially their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.080]   were designed for sports performance.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.620]   And indeed, all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.120]   can be used while running, while cycling,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.240]   they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty,
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.660]   they're extremely lightweight,
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.480]   but they also have an enormous number of varieties
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.560]   of eyeglasses and sunglasses that are designed
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.800]   to be worn at work or to dinner.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.260]   So they have the sort of classic performance eyeglasses
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.340]   where it makes you look like a cyborg if you like those.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.600]   They also have more conventional aesthetics
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.700]   that you'd be comfortable wearing pretty much anywhere.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.060]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.880]   Okay, let's talk about hair.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.680]   And in researching this episode,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.760]   by talking to experts in the biology of hair
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.920]   and the stem cells that exist in all of us
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.320]   that give rise to our hair growth
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.360]   and the pigmentation in our hair,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.920]   and in talking to experts who understand how to halt
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.020]   and even reverse hair loss,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.760]   that there is a tremendously interesting biology
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.160]   surrounding hair,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.080]   but there's also an incredible psychology around hair.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.460]   In fact, most people who experience even marginal hair loss
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.540]   undergo pretty severe anxiety.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.760]   Now, I confess this is not something I can relate to.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.140]   I am losing my hair in certain places.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.160]   I'm 47 years old.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.860]   I've got a couple of patches up front
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.560]   where there's very minimal hair.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.720]   I think that, as we'll later learn in this episode,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.020]   reflects a higher density of DHT,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.760]   dihydrotestosterone receptors at that particular location
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.440]   as opposed to elsewhere on my scalp.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.260]   But keeping my hair is not something
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.920]   that I've fretted about much of my life.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.840]   And yet, as I was researching this episode,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   I remembered an anecdote from my childhood
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.440]   where my father told me,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.640]   and I think it was because I was stressing about something.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.120]   And I was trying to get to sleep.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.380]   And he said, "Don't stress, calm down."
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.760]   And here's why.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.400]   If you stress too much,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.760]   it can actually make your hair fall out.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.540]   In fact, I have a cousin who lay down one night stressed
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.820]   and woke up the next morning
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.480]   and all of his hair was on his pillow.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.540]   And I'll never forget that story.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.220]   I think he was trying to get me to stress less.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.660]   I don't know if that story made me stress less or not.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.400]   But in any event, I don't know that that story is true.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.880]   I'm not going to challenge the authenticity of that story.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.960]   I didn't have a chance to reach out to my father
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.420]   and ask him to verify or not.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.760]   But as we'll soon learn,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.080]   it is true that our psychological wellbeing
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.360]   can impact both the coloration, or lack thereof,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.160]   and the growth rates of our hair.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.760]   That's a real thing.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.540]   And the reverse is also true,
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.600]   which is that as hair starts to thin or fall out
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.640]   or change color,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.240]   many people experience intense anxiety or even depression.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   This was not something I was really aware of.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.680]   And perhaps that's just
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.500]   because I've always kept my hair pretty short anyway.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.440]   I always assumed that my hair started to really fall out
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.480]   or just shave my head.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   But that's me.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.740]   And that's not most people out there.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.200]   I think most people would loathe to lose their hair.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.820]   And in fact, given the enormous number,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.000]   probably up in the high billions of dollars and euros
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.200]   and other currency, of course,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.640]   that people invest in trying to halt
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   or reverse their hair loss,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.260]   it's clear that hair is very, very important to people.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.280]   What we know is that by age 50,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.780]   approximately 50% of all men and women
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.840]   will have experienced significant enough hair loss
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.480]   that they start to notice it.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.420]   And a large percentage, up to 85% of those people
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.440]   will experience some sort of anxiety
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.760]   that leads them to go out
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.640]   and try and either halt or reverse that hair loss.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.980]   Now, why at age 50?
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.820]   Well, an important point arises from that,
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.460]   which is that the hair loss is not occurring
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.700]   between the 49th and 50th birthday.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   Hair loss is ongoing from about age 30 to age 50.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.780]   It's only by age 50, however,
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.540]   that about 50% of people out there
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.540]   start to notice that hair loss.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.600]   And this is typically because they'll be in a bathroom
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.660]   or looking in a mirror,
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.680]   and the lighting will be bright enough
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.860]   that it permeates the sort of outer boundary of their hair,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.200]   and they'll notice that their hair is thinning
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.700]   in a particular location.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.740]   That's usually how the sort of thing happens.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.460]   So again, our psychological states can impact
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.660]   our patterns of hair growth or loss,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.980]   and of course, patterns of hair growth,
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.380]   but more typically hair loss and hair graying
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.020]   can really impact psychological state.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.500]   So this is a subject that people take intense interest in.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.820]   And today we're going to talk about how hair normally grows,
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.940]   why it grows at the rate
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.320]   and for the duration that it happens to.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.620]   And then as we talk about ways
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.780]   to intervene with that hair loss,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.640]   those biological mechanisms will come up
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.000]   because they really provide a nice framework
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.040]   for explaining why certain treatments work more or less well
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.900]   or why certain treatments might have certain side effects
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.560]   or total lack of side effects.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.760]   It will also highlight a really key theme
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.060]   that will come up several times in today's podcast,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.380]   which is that there are both mechanical
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.380]   and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.460]   Mechanical approaches would be things
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.260]   as simple as massaging the scalp,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.100]   but mechanical changes to the scalp
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.020]   can cause either hair loss or facilitate hair growth.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.820]   This is why things like microneedling are so prominent
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.400]   in the context of trying to reverse hair loss.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.580]   But again, there are also chemical approaches
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.900]   to trying to halt or reverse hair loss.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.680]   And this relates to the fact
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.940]   that the hair growth itself is strongly regulated
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.620]   by hormones such as estrogen, thyroid hormone,
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.380]   insulin-like growth factor,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.780]   and that other hormones, in particular the androgens,
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.500]   so things like testosterone,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.920]   but mainly it's derivatives like dihydrotestosterone,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.120]   are very much involved in setting the stage for hair growth
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.580]   by controlling how big or small that pool of stem cells
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.820]   that gives rise to hair growth is.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.380]   So if any of the terms I just use are confusing to you,
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.220]   don't worry.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.260]   I will make all of those very clear in a moment.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.200]   It's actually all pretty straightforward and simple.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.840]   And so I'd like to just start
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.780]   by talking about what hair is, how it grows,
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.920]   why it stops growing, and why hair normally falls out.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.620]   Let's talk about the biology of hair.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.440]   And in doing so, I also want to talk about stem cells.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.720]   Now, keep in mind that when you hear the word stem cells,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.680]   you, probably like most people,
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.260]   think about the sorts of cells
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.460]   that people are getting injected into their face
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.340]   to get rid of wrinkles or give them new skin
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.020]   or to give them more hair if it's injected in the scalp
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.180]   or into a joint to repair a joint or a muscle.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.180]   Those stem cells are what we call exogenous stem cells,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.480]   exogenous, meaning from outside the body.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.860]   The stem cells that we're going to talk about today
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.760]   are so-called endogenous stem cells,
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.780]   cells that we all make that can give rise to other cells.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.980]   And that's really the definition of a stem cell.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.880]   Stem cells are present in all of us
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.220]   from the very beginning of life.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.860]   So when sperm meets egg,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.980]   that cell, which we think of as the egg,
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.260]   starts to duplicate.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.300]   It incorporates the DNA from the sperm and the egg,
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.340]   of course, starts to duplicate.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.700]   And then those cells give rise to more cells and more cells.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.660]   And the ability of all those cells to replicate
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.500]   and create more cells are
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.500]   because those cells really are stem cells.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.260]   Now, at some point, we are a completed body plan,
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.040]   as the biologists say.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.860]   We end up with a brain and a spinal cord and limbs
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.740]   and fingers and livers and guts
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.020]   and all the things that we need
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.260]   in order to be a functioning human being,
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.340]   even though we're a baby at that time, we haven't grown up.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.320]   We have all the bits that we're going to have
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   for our entire life.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.660]   At that point, many of the stem cell populations disappear.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.920]   For instance, past puberty and probably earlier,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.300]   you don't get many more new brain cells.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.100]   You get a few, but you don't get many more new brain cells
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.980]   because the brain doesn't have many stem cell populations.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.660]   Whereas other organs in your body
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.700]   maintain little pockets of stem cells
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.900]   or in some cases, many, many stem cells
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.280]   that can give rise to more and more of that tissue
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.560]   across the lifespan.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.740]   And hair is one such tissue.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.420]   So if we take a look at hair,
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.340]   what we find is that indeed,
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.780]   there are these things that we call hairs,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.740]   but there are also stem cells.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.980]   And those stem cells are actually what give rise
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.340]   to the hairs that we see on the head of our scalp
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.020]   or that we see on the surface of our body.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.820]   So right off the bat,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.780]   you should know that every single hair that you have
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.940]   is there because you have a stem cell population
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.900]   that is giving rise to that particular hair.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.700]   So let's take a step back or rather, I should say,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.160]   let's zoom in on one hair and the stem cell population
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.000]   that gives rise to that hair because in doing so,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.300]   you're going to learn all the different components
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.100]   that you can tap into if your goal
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.900]   is to halt the loss of hairs
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.260]   or to replace hairs that have already been lost.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.900]   Okay, so if we were to just zoom in at the level of one hair,
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.160]   what you would find is that that hair has
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.140]   what typically is called a hair root.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.900]   So that's the portion below the skin.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.180]   And when we say below the skin,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.640]   it means that it dives down into a narrow trench,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.340]   which is in the so-called epidermis,
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.380]   which is this outer layer of skin.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.980]   It also has a shaft.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.300]   The shaft is the part that grows out above the skin.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.620]   So what you see on somebody's head
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.620]   or you see on their arm,
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.820]   or when you see an eyebrow, you're seeing the shaft
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.640]   of the hair, the root, of course, goes below the skin.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.580]   What most people don't realize, however,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.420]   is that down at the base of the root,
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.420]   there's actually a little cave, a little pocket.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.460]   So if you were to look at this,
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.660]   it would look like a little bulb, a little round area
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.820]   with a bunch of stuff in it right below the root.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.380]   And within that little cave, there are stem cells.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.540]   There are populations of cells
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.080]   that have the ability to divide, right?
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.380]   We call this mitosis.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.780]   It's a process by which cells can actually divide
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.420]   and take DNA with them and then give rise to other cells.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.260]   We call those cells that divide and move out.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.920]   We call those daughter cells.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.660]   We call the cells that give rise to them progenitor cells,
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.320]   but they are effectively stem cells that give rise
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.760]   to these, what we call daughter cells.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.500]   Those daughter cells then become the various types of cells
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.220]   that make up the hair.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.500]   So when you see a hair, you're not seeing something
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.380]   that grows throughout the lifespan.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.380]   You're seeing something that's going to be born down there
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.260]   in that little cave, then is going to grow.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.580]   It's actually going to stack up on top of itself,
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.820]   and that's because hairs are made up
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.420]   of a protein called keratin.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.900]   There are a bunch of different kinds of keratins,
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.140]   depending on what kind of hair you're looking at,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.140]   but these are little proteins that stack up
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.480]   on top of one another, and they're structured in a way
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.620]   that makes them pretty darn durable.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.420]   I mean, it's possible, of course, to pull a hair out,
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.040]   but if you've ever tried to tear a hair,
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.620]   in particular a thick hair, like one from the face
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.600]   or even one off the top of your head,
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.700]   it's actually a pretty tensile, strong little thing,
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.540]   and that's because keratins stack up on top of one another
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.980]   and bind to one another with a really strong bond.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.620]   So what you end up with is a bunch of proteins stacked up
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.740]   on top of one another, and that's the actual hair, okay?
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.840]   So we've got the hair shaft, the hair root,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.020]   and then we've got the stem cells down there in that pocket
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.060]   that give rise to the various cells
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.020]   that make up the actual hair.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.880]   We also have down there in that little cave,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.980]   which by the way is actually called the hair bulb,
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.540]   if you really want to know the technical name,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.360]   'cause it's shaped like a bulb.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.600]   We have not just stem cells,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.620]   but we have cells that give rise to the pigment of the hair
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.720]   that create what's called melanin.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.340]   Now, some people have very blonde hair, very light hair.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.580]   Some people have darker hair, but everybody,
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.700]   unless they have what's called the albino mutation,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.060]   where the hairs are truly white, they lack all melanin,
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.360]   and it's a pretty rare condition, although it does happen.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.740]   Most people have some degree of melanin in their hairs
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.140]   because there are little pockets of melanin-producing cells.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.420]   Melanin's just a protein that essentially gets injected
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.660]   into the keratin, into the hair,
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.940]   and it gives it its darker color.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.900]   Now, there are a couple other components about the hair
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.380]   that you need to know about,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.540]   especially if you're interested in reversing hair loss
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.980]   or reversing graying of hair.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.260]   One of those components is a little gland.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.260]   So next to every hair root,
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.840]   within the dermal layer of the skin,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.100]   so this is below the epidermis,
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.980]   there is a gland called the sebaceous gland,
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.020]   and the sebaceous gland makes oily stuff,
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.220]   and the oily stuff is called sebum.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.420]   I know the name sort of evokes something kind of gross,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.100]   but sebum is actually really cool and really important.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.140]   The sebum gets injected, or seeps, rather,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.660]   into the area right around the hair
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.260]   as the hair starts to approach the surface,
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.880]   where it goes from essentially root to shaft.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.620]   And the sebum does two things.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.900]   First of all, it forms a little bit of a seal
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.700]   right at the place where the hair exits the skin,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.500]   and that seal is very important
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.980]   actually for waterproofing of your skin.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.540]   So we don't often think of ourselves as waterproof
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.600]   because we are so accustomed to water
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.180]   just landing on our skin and rolling off,
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.280]   but that's because of some of the oily properties
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.120]   of our skin.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.180]   Now, it's also true that our skin
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.300]   is pretty densely packed with cells,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.440]   but in the absence of sebum,
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.100]   we would not be as waterproof as we are.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.500]   Now, as I mentioned, sebum has two important properties.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.440]   The other important property of sebum
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.820]   is that it actually is a strong antibacterial
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.320]   and antimicrobial.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.400]   Most people don't realize this.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.820]   The oils of your skin provide a lot of immune boundary
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.060]   so that things don't get into the hair root
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.880]   or the region around it and infect our skin.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.360]   So sebum, while the name is sort of unattractive,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.260]   to be honest, is actually performing some essential roles
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.220]   both for waterproofing and for our immune system function
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.580]   protecting us from various kinds of infection.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.020]   We're going to return to sebum later.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.180]   As it turns out, sebum is also very important
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.860]   as it relates to psoriasis
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.440]   and as it relates to some of the fungal components
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.500]   that can cause hair loss, okay?
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.460]   So just going to file that away.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.820]   There's another important component
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.540]   of the region around hairs,
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.020]   which is the erector pili muscle.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.420]   The erector pili muscle is a muscle that lies diagonally
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.420]   between that bulb portion of the hair
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.540]   or a little bit above it
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.560]   and goes up to the surface of the skin.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.140]   The erector pili muscle is a muscle that contracts
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.380]   when we get cold or when we get scared.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.940]   So if you've ever had goosebumps,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.280]   that's because the erector pili muscle contracts
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.500]   pulling the skin at the surface down
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.660]   around the little hair follicles
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.700]   or at least where the hairs meet the surface of the skin.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.460]   And so those little bumps are actually
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.260]   where little micro hairs reside
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.120]   and the dimples between them are the dimples that occur
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.900]   when this erector pili muscle pulls down.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.380]   Now, why would this muscle exist?
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.140]   It has a couple of important functions.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.040]   One of the functions is that when it pulls down,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.660]   it causes, as the name suggests, the hairs to stand up,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.960]   maybe not perfectly vertical, but they, when you hear,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.220]   "Oh, I was so frightened, my hair stood up on end."
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.140]   And that's because the hairs become erect, they stand up.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.100]   Now, why would this happen when we get cold?
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.740]   It happens because when the hairs stand up,
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.780]   air can be trapped between those hairs
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.700]   and can actually warm our body.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.460]   This is not so much the case if you have very light hair
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.460]   on your skin, if you're a very hairy person,
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.180]   this is going to be a more robust aspect of your physiology.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.180]   And yes, this is why dogs like huskies can go out in the snow
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.460]   and still remain warm.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.540]   When they get cold, their hairs actually stand up a bit
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.900]   on end because of the contraction
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.960]   of these erector pili muscles trapping air in there,
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.680]   and then their body warms the hair, trapped beneath the hair
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.500]   and it's sort of like they've got a blanket on
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.700]   made by the interface between the hair,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.460]   the air and their skin.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.100]   So just to recap, all the components of hair
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.940]   and the different things around it that are going
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.520]   to be relevant for understanding how to replace hair
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.480]   that's lost, we have the hair itself,
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.820]   which has the shaft that sticks out over the skin,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.780]   goes a little bit into the skin,
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.460]   but basically sticks out over the skin.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.300]   We have the root portion, which goes down into the skin,
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.440]   it goes through the epidermis and into the dermis.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.340]   Then we have this bulb-like region down at the bottom,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.020]   down at the bottom of that bulb, we have stem cells
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.940]   that actually give rise to the actual hair,
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.640]   and we have pigmenting cells that pigment that hair.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.400]   In addition, and this is very important,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.220]   there are capillaries that go into that bulb region
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.660]   down at the bottom of the hair,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.620]   and that can serve and support the stem cells,
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.140]   the melanin producing cells, which are called melanocytes.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.940]   So the melanin producing cells and the stem cells
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.160]   get a lot of blood flow that allows them
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.840]   to keep providing new hair,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.180]   or the proteins that make up hair,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.700]   and the pigment that goes into those hairs,
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.160]   and those little capillaries deliver not just nutrients
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.820]   and things of that sort, but they also deliver oxygen,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.340]   because it turns out that the whole process
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.420]   of growing more hair is a very active process.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.060]   Now, as soon as you hear oxygen,
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.660]   and you hear that the growth is an active process,
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.220]   that should cue you to why so many of the stories
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.860]   around how to keep your hair and regrow hair
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.960]   involve statements like don't wear a hat,
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   it'll make your hair fall out,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.620]   or if you want your hair to grow back,
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.000]   you know, don't wear hats, or massage your scalp,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.500]   or increase blood flow,
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.520]   or why some people will suggest
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.960]   that people take peppermint oil, for instance,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.420]   or menthol-type oils of different kinds
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.040]   and massage them into the scalp,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.540]   things that make the scalp tingle,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.800]   or there will be light therapies designed to what?
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.160]   To increase blood flow to the scalp.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.320]   The whole rationale there is that you're trying
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.440]   to increase blood flow to the stem cell
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.400]   and the melanocyte populations that support the hairs
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.120]   and that actually create the hairs.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.560]   Now, whether or not those approaches work,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.480]   we'll touch on a little bit later.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.340]   I'll just give you a little bit of a hint right now,
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.220]   which is that while no single one of those approaches
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.440]   that I described is known to regrow hair
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.360]   in a very robust way,
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.160]   because of the requirement for oxygen and nutrients,
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.080]   and because it's such an active process
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.580]   for the stem cells and melanocytes
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.500]   to grow and darken the hairs that grow out of your skin,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.540]   it is true that manipulations or treatments
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.620]   that increase blood flow to those regions
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.560]   can at least slow the loss of hair,
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.220]   or can even extend the duration
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.880]   over which hairs continue to grow.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.680]   So if you've heard things like don't wear a hat
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.980]   if you want to maintain your hair,
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.080]   or massage your scalp if you want your hair to grow faster,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.860]   in some sense, that's true,
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.520]   but none of those manipulations on their own
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.940]   is going to robustly enhance the rate of your hair growth.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.280]   Those things are designed to be done
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.740]   in conjunction with some other treatments
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.880]   that have been shown in many, many clinical studies
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.600]   to increase the rate and duration of hair growth.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.760]   So now you have in mind a picture of what's happening
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.400]   at the level of individual hairs.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.540]   And if you're anything like me, you're probably thinking,
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.040]   wow, there's a lot going on down there,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.800]   just below the surface of the skin, and indeed there is.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.020]   But really the things to think about
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.280]   are that stem cell population
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   that actually give rise to the hair proteins,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.660]   so that actually create the hair,
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.200]   the melanocytes that darken that hair, they give it pigment,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.100]   that sebaceous gland and the oil sebum
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.120]   that provides some important antimicrobial
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.660]   and other properties to that general region,
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.400]   and that erector pili muscle.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.160]   That erector pili muscle, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.440]   is important for creating goosebumps,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.380]   and it's important for keeping huskies
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.640]   warm in cold environments,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.080]   but it's doing some other really important things as well,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   and we'll talk about those as time goes on in this episode.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.360]   Right now, what I want to do is just talk for a moment
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.940]   about how hairs actually grow
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.780]   and why they grow the way they do.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.520]   This is extremely important
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.980]   toward understanding hair replacement and slowing hair loss.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.260]   There are three basic phases of growth of a hair.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.560]   The first phase is the phase in which the stem cells
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.960]   down in that bulb give rise to the cells
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.640]   that make up the proteins of the hair,
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   so the actual growth of the hair,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.440]   and keep in mind that the hair is actually growing
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.620]   from the bottom up.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.460]   Now, you might think,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.440]   "Of course it's growing from the bottom up."
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.400]   Everyone knows that, but a lot of people think
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.120]   that the hair starts growing right at the surface
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:32.960]   of the skin.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.780]   That's not the way it works.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.280]   The hair is actually growing from deep within the root
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.960]   and stacking up and then eventually extends out
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.360]   across the top of the skin.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.260]   That growth phase is called the anagen phase, A-N-A-G-E-N.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.520]   And this, for some people, will ring a bell
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.300]   because if you've ever been interested in weightlifting,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.900]   or even if you're an endurance runner,
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.260]   you'll hear about things that are anabolic
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.560]   that promote growth, so ana of growth,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.940]   or catabolic that promote breakdown.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.940]   So the first phase of hair growth is called the anagen phase,
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.660]   and it's a period of varying duration
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.140]   depending on which hair and the body we're talking about.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.160]   So the anagen or the growth phase for hairs on the head,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.900]   as I mentioned earlier, is anywhere from two to eight years.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.040]   For most people, it's going to be about six years.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.300]   What this means is that if we were to just not cut our hair,
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.820]   just let our hair grow for two to eight years,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.220]   that hair would eventually grow to a length
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.140]   that it was at its maximum and then would stop growing.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.380]   So we can say that the anagen phase of hairs on the scalp
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.300]   is two to eight years, the duration of the growth phase.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.240]   Contrast that, for instance,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.040]   with the duration of the anagen phase
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.780]   for hairs of the eyebrows.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.300]   The hairs of the eyebrows grow
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.140]   about 4.2 millimeters per month.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.780]   Believe it or not, people have measured this sort of thing.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.860]   Now, that's an average,
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.560]   so some people are going to have eyebrows
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   that grow much longer per month.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.940]   I'm somebody who, for instance,
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.740]   has mostly the same length eyebrow hairs,
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.500]   every once in a while, I get one of those eyebrow hairs
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.460]   that really seems to be heading off my head,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.940]   it really wants out of there,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.840]   and so it's much longer than the rest.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.700]   What does that mean?
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.880]   Does it mean that it grew faster?
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.760]   Maybe, but chances are the stem cell population
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.260]   in that particular eyebrow follicle,
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.220]   for that one eyebrow hair,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.940]   is longer than it is for the others.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.900]   This is really important.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.420]   I'm trying to illustrate two principles at once here.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.860]   The first principle is that different hairs on your body,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.340]   including the hairs on your scalp,
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.300]   have a growth phase of different duration.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.700]   This is why the hairs on your head can grow very, very long
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.060]   'cause they have a very long anagen or growth phase,
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.640]   and the hairs on your eyebrows will only grow
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.740]   for a few months before they actually fall out
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.260]   and then have to undergo replication of the stem cells
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.380]   to give you new eyebrow hair to then grow.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.060]   What's important here is not just that there are differences
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.200]   in the duration of the growth phase,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.100]   but rather that the rate of hair growth is not something
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.720]   that tends to differ within a given body region, right?
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.800]   You'll hear people say,
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.760]   "Oh, my hair grows really, really fast."
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.600]   Other people will say,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.180]   "Oh, my hair grows really, really slowly."
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.160]   That is probably not the case.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.380]   While there could be slight differences
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.500]   in the rate of growth,
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.700]   that is the addition of more keratin to the actual hairs,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.420]   so creation of more hair more quickly,
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.660]   almost certainly what's happening
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.180]   is that the duration of the anagen phase in some people
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.040]   is just much longer than it is in other people,
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.640]   and we don't realize this,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.380]   and we tend to think more in terms of how fast hair grows
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.740]   because if you were to just look at somebody's hair,
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.280]   you'd say, "Oh, they're all more or less the same length."
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.060]   I mean, some people's bangs are shorter than the back
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.900]   because they cut them,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.160]   but if they were to just grow their hair,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.820]   you'd say, "Oh, it's all more or less the same length,"
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.080]   but if we were to zoom in with a microscope,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.520]   we would see that there are a lot of hairs down there
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.340]   in between the other hairs that are very, very short
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.660]   or even tiny, tiny, tiny,
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660]   and those are coming in
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.740]   as the other ones are finishing their anagen phase, okay?
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.860]   So that's the anagen or growth phase.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.080]   After the anagen phase comes the catagen phase.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.900]   Again, this resembles the word catabolic
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.180]   or the breakdown phase.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.300]   During the catagen phase,
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.060]   the hair is actually receding not from the top
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.580]   down to the skin surface and then into the root,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.620]   but the other way.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.460]   It's actually receding from that bulb region
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.180]   up toward the surface,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.220]   and that catagen phase is going to also be
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.300]   of different duration depending on
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.380]   which area of the body you're in,
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.500]   and it will vary a little bit depending on who you are,
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.820]   meaning from person to person.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.700]   We'll talk about the influences on the anagen
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.440]   and catagen phase in a moment.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.420]   Why is it important that it actually recedes
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.860]   from the inside out?
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.980]   Well, that's important because as it does that,
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.940]   there's actually a change in that bulb region down below
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.660]   because normally there's an interface.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.740]   There's a conversation that's occurring
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.140]   between the stem cell population,
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.740]   the melanocytes, and the hair itself,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.180]   and they support each other.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.100]   And remember there's blood vessels going into that area
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.900]   or rather capillaries that are feeding that area as well.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.260]   After the catagen phase comes the telogen phase,
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.740]   which means rest.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.760]   The telogen phase is a period in which no new hair proteins
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.460]   are being added by those stem cells.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.620]   And during that telogen phase,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.440]   that bulb down there at the bottom,
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.960]   instead of being nice and oval and really having
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.500]   a lot of space in it with all these different things
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.500]   like stem cells, starts to pinch off from the little tube
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.440]   that comes down from the surface of the skin
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.020]   that normally would have a hair in it,
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.320]   it starts to pinch off.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.680]   And at some point, many hair follicles pinch off
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.760]   that bulb region and it recedes and dies.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.480]   And when it recedes and dies,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.160]   the stem cell population and the melanocytes go with it.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.560]   In other words, there is no longer a population
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.180]   of stem cells to give rise to more hair
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.980]   after that telogen phase.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.640]   And there's no longer melanocytes to pigment the hair.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.220]   And in fact, the hair isn't there anymore,
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.940]   so there's no hair even to pigment after that telogen phase,
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.640]   unless it's a hair of a particular type,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.740]   such as the hair on your scalp,
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.200]   which can then reenter the cell cycle
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.100]   and get back into an antigen phase
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.940]   and regrow more hair from stem cells.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.140]   So there are three critical stages
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.180]   of the life cycle of a hair
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.300]   that are relevant to today's conversation.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.920]   There's the antigen phase during which the hair grows.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.180]   There's the catagen phase
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.940]   during which the hair actually starts to recede and die.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.500]   The protein is actually disappearing from the bottom up.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.400]   And then we have the telogen phase,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.740]   which is the phase in which the stem cell population
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.880]   is what's called a semiquiescent, semiquiet,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.820]   or completely quiescent, where it's not active at all.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.860]   Those three phases make up the life cycle of a hair,
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.160]   keeping in mind that for some hairs,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.440]   they can reenter the life cycle
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.220]   and go back into the antigen phase
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.340]   if there's stem cells there,
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.360]   and if there's oxygen there,
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.580]   and if there is sufficient blood support,
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.500]   and, and this is a very important and,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.480]   if there are the appropriate hormonal signals
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.860]   to support growth,
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.640]   and there is a reduction or an absence
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.500]   in the hormone signals that actually trigger
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.160]   that telogen phase.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.340]   I make this point now
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.500]   because much of the rest of today's discussion
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.660]   is going to focus on why particular hormones,
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.740]   such as dihydrotestosterone, cause hair loss,
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.640]   and why inhibiting things like dihydrotestosterone
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.620]   can support the preservation of hair that you have
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.100]   and the regrowth of hair.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.620]   And to make a long story very short,
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.260]   and then we'll get into some additional details
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.100]   that are relevant
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.280]   and that I hope you'll stick around to listen to,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.540]   dihydrotestosterone, which is the derivative of testosterone,
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.700]   causes changes in that bulb region
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.420]   where the stem cells reside.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.900]   It shortens or halts the antigen phase of hair growth,
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   and it extends and promotes the catagen and telogen phase.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.740]   So when we hear that, oh, you know,
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.860]   dihydrotestosterone makes your hair fall out,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.660]   or estrogen makes your hair grow,
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.060]   there are real chemical, or we should say biochemical,
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.220]   legitimate reasons as to why that is,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.720]   but it all comes back to this three phases of hair growth,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.780]   the antigen growth phase,
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.360]   the catagen catabolic or hair loss phase,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.320]   and the telogen phase,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.940]   which is a rest period in which the hairs
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.280]   can either come back if it reenters the antigen phase,
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.240]   or maybe it's over for good.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.120]   Hormones are the accelerator and the brake
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.060]   on each one of those phases.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.460]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.500]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.960]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.320]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.220]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.920]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.120]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.720]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.800]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.780]   once or usually twice a day
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.700]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.400]   that I need for gut health.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.480]   Our gut is very important.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.040]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.800]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.200]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.840]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.680]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.520]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.080]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.000]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.880]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.320]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.780]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.180]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.160]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.480]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.760]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.040]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.440]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.140]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.520]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.680]   So now you have in mind the anatomy of the hair
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.120]   and the area from which it grows and the stem cells, et cetera.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.920]   The fact that there's capillary innervation
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.560]   delivering oxygen and blood flow to the stem cells
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.960]   that give rise to the hair,
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.160]   and that there are these three critical phases
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.940]   of hair growth, antigen, catagen, and telogen.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.160]   Now let's talk about the accelerators on hair growth
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.500]   and the breaks on hair growth.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.740]   There are many accelerators on hair growth,
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.620]   but the first one that I really want to underscore
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.080]   is blood flow itself,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.900]   which equates to the delivery of nutrients and oxygen.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.440]   This is very important,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.360]   and it explains a lot of the treatments
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.200]   for halting and reversing hair loss.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.040]   For instance, one of the longest standing treatments
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   for halting and reversing hair loss is so-called minoxidil.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.580]   Minoxidil, sometimes also referred to
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.560]   by the brand name Rogaine,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.460]   was actually a drug that was developed
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.040]   to treat hypertension.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.500]   So this is a cardiac drug that lowers blood pressure,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.220]   and it does that by causing vasodilation.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.140]   It allows more blood flow,
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.180]   not just to the hairs on your scalp,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.120]   but to hairs everywhere on your body.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.060]   And indeed, most people don't realize this,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.640]   but minoxidil won't just slow the loss of hair
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.860]   from your scalp.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.380]   It is also effective at slowing the loss of hair
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.460]   elsewhere in your body.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.120]   How does it do that?
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.140]   Well, you now know one of the major ways it does that.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.820]   It does that by extending the anagen phase,
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.180]   how it basically makes that phase a bit longer.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.860]   It doesn't make it much, much longer,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.500]   which is why for most people
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.940]   who are losing their hair quickly
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.220]   or who have already lost their hair,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.260]   minoxidil alone is not going to be a sufficient treatment.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.140]   However, minoxidil has been shown to be effective
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.800]   at slowing rates of hair loss,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.940]   and people that are starting to experience some hair loss
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.780]   all get into dosages and things of that sort
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.640]   a little bit later.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.960]   But right now I just want to really focus on the logic
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.160]   of why people would take this drug,
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.680]   which is lowering hypertension at all
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.000]   as it relates to hair loss, right?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.500]   That might seem like kind of crazy
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.180]   until you understand the anatomy and the growth of hairs,
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.220]   which you now do.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.740]   So that's what minoxidil is doing.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.280]   It's creating more blood flow to the hairs,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.520]   which because minoxidil does have this positive effect,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.620]   at least most people would like to slow their rates
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.080]   of hair loss on their scalp anyway,
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.940]   it tells you that blood flow and delivery of oxygen
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.620]   and other nutrients from the blood is pretty critical,
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.200]   if not very critical,
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.980]   for the support of the hair growth cycle itself.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.680]   Now, again, we haven't talked at all
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.340]   about the sorts of chemicals
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.740]   or the signals within the body such as hormones
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.500]   that actually direct the growth of hairs.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.060]   Here we're just talking about a mechanical change,
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.020]   allow more blood flow to the region
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.900]   and thereby extend the antigen phase,
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.500]   which is exactly what happens with minoxidil.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.880]   Now, minoxidil does have other effects,
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.540]   and this is why dosing of minoxidil
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.660]   becomes a little bit complicated
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.260]   and can be a little bit tricky to troubleshoot.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.500]   It can greatly lower blood pressure
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.280]   or lower blood pressure just a little bit,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.060]   depending on how sensitive somebody is
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.680]   to that particular drug.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.620]   So oftentimes physicians will start people
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.980]   on minoxidil dosages that are very low,
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.260]   ideally that would be the case,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.220]   and then ratchet it up in order to figure out
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.860]   where the minimal effective dose
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.300]   or the kind of critical threshold is
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.200]   beyond which they start experiencing
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.340]   some pretty uncomfortable side effects,
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.380]   such as swelling of the ankles or headaches or dizziness.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.740]   These things can happen with the use of Rogaine,
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.420]   AKA minoxidil.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.960]   Now, minoxidil has also been associated
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.980]   with increases in the hormone prolactin.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.540]   Prolactin is a hormone that's released from the pituitary.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.200]   It is a hormone that acts also
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.940]   as a bit of a neurotransmitter like many hormones,
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.160]   and it tends to be antagonistic or an opposite to dopamine.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.540]   So dopamine is a neurochemical,
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.000]   it's actually a neuromodulator,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.500]   meaning it modulates the activity
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.940]   of a bunch of neural circuits in the brain.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.720]   It also controls the release of various hormones
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.600]   in the body.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.260]   Dopamine is almost always associated
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.940]   with states of motivation, pursuit, and drive.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.820]   It has a little bit of a kind of feel-good element to it,
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.060]   which is why a lot of people think dopamine is associated
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.260]   with reward and pleasure,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.860]   but it's really about energy, motivation, and drive.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.560]   Dopamine and prolactin are, as I mentioned before,
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.900]   antagonistic to one another.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.760]   They're in sort of a push-pull.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.740]   So people who take minoxidil,
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.060]   especially if they're very sensitive to it
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.340]   or they take dosages that are too high,
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.820]   will experience increases in prolactin
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.620]   that in turn can cause things like reductions in libido,
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.220]   reductions in overall feelings of wellbeing, apathy.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.620]   And in some cases where the elevations in prolactin
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.820]   are more extreme, they can experience, for instance,
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.540]   increase in male breast tissue, gynecomastia,
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.400]   or even small bits of milk let down, things of that sort.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.460]   In women who take minoxidil,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.860]   the side effects are much like the ones experienced in men.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.100]   So there can be swelling, edema of the tissues,
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.900]   because if you get too much vasodilation
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.140]   and too much lowering of blood pressure, that's not good,
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.780]   headaches, dizziness, and so on.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.460]   So dosing of minoxidil is really important.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.060]   If somebody is going to use minoxidil
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.840]   in order to try and slow or reverse hair loss,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.820]   and again, it mainly is going to be used
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.120]   to slow rates of hair loss,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.020]   not to actually reverse hair loss,
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.140]   the really key thing is to get that dosage right.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.620]   So the ranges of minoxidil that you'll see suggested
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.300]   and that people use out there are vast.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.260]   And I should also mention that there are two major routes
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.700]   by which people get minoxidil to the hair follicle.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.780]   One is to take it systemically as a pill,
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.980]   where it goes into the general circulation.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.940]   The other is to take it topically as a cream.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.040]   There are prescription and non-prescription forms
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.460]   of minoxidil, just to further complicate things.
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.980]   But the ranges of oral minoxidil that you'll see out there
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.660]   and that people take range anywhere from 0.25 milligrams
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.760]   all the way up to five milligrams per day.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.660]   So that's an enormous range, it's like a 20-fold range.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.000]   The topical minoxidil is also found
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.160]   in various concentrations.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.800]   The typical concentration is going to be a 5% concentration
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.680]   that people will use once per day.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.720]   Topical treatment with minoxidil at 5% concentration
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.380]   is thought to just stay at the scalp,
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.360]   but we now know that it can go systemically.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.140]   It can get into the general bloodstream.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.700]   Why that issue make complete sense to you?
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.440]   Because when you put something on your scalp,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.120]   I've already told you that these little pits,
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.980]   these little tubes that go down to those bulb regions
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.300]   below the skin that have direct access to the blood supply.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.440]   So when you massage something into your scalp,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.040]   it not only has the opportunity
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.060]   to get into your general circulation, it often does,
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:37.160]   especially if it's something that's very water-soluble,
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.960]   and that way can get into the capillaries
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.640]   and into the general bloodstream.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.900]   Although topical treatments,
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.260]   of which we're going to discuss a number of them today,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.880]   don't tend to get into the general circulation
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.280]   as robustly as taking something by way of pill or capsule.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.600]   Okay, so minoxidil works by way of increasing blood flow
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.520]   to the stem cell niche below the hair.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.920]   The dosage ranges of the oral minoxidil are tremendous,
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.360]   0.25 milligrams all the way up to five milligrams
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.400]   once per day.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.160]   The dosage range of the topical solutions
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.880]   tends to be a little bit more confined.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.840]   Typically it's a 5% solution,
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.200]   and it's recommended that people use it one time daily,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.600]   maybe twice daily.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.360]   It's also important, by the way,
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.960]   if you're going to take this route,
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.240]   that you actually leave that solution on the scalp
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.360]   for three to five minutes.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.680]   This is important and should make complete sense
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.520]   as to why it's important.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.160]   You can't just rub the stuff into your head
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.180]   and then rinse it off and expect it to be absorbed.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.600]   It actually needs to seep down into those hair follicles
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.320]   and access the niche.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.080]   How do people arrive at the correct dosage for minoxidil?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.880]   Well, for better or for worse, really.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.920]   In some cases, it's accomplished by finding out
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.360]   that you have an unwanted side effect,
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.400]   like dizziness or swelling of your ankles or edema,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.720]   or I would hope this wouldn't be the case,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.640]   but something that suggests there's hyperprolactinemia.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.800]   You could get a blood test to measure your prolactin,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.000]   or you perhaps notice a drop in libido or some lethargy,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.820]   these sorts of things that are common
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.200]   to reduce levels of dopamine, increase levels of prolactin.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.240]   I would hope that if people are working with a physician
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.460]   or if they're not in taking minoxidil,
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.240]   that they would start with the lowest possible dose.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.680]   So for oral minoxidil, that would be 0.25 milligrams
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.640]   and then increase it as needed
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.040]   rather than jumping in right at five milligrams,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.440]   because some of those side effects,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.560]   in particular the fluid retention and the hyperprolactinemia
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.920]   can be pretty uncomfortable
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.000]   and can disrupt a lot of aspects of life
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.320]   that most all of us consider desirable.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.940]   Okay, so we're really focusing right now
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.400]   on treatments that relate to the critical requirement
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.760]   for hair stem cells to receive blood flow
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.340]   in order to receive oxygen and nutrients
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.760]   to get the hair to grow.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.520]   And that's really what minoxidil is about.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's also what all of those anecdotes you hear
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.120]   are all about like massaging the scalp
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.400]   or putting red light on the scalp.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.160]   Although red light might do some other things,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.680]   in general heating or lighting of the scalp
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.240]   or massaging of the scalp is really designed
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.480]   to increase blood flow to the scalp.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.900]   Now, the reason minoxidil works at all
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.920]   is because it is going to increase blood flow
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.820]   around the clock.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.060]   And that's because people are taking it topically
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.040]   and it's seeping into the general circulation
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.520]   or at least it's staying somewhat restricted
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.140]   to the hair cell niche or they're taking it orally
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.180]   and it makes it to that hair cell niche below the follicle.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.720]   When we massage our scalp, however,
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.120]   that's a transient thing.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.540]   I can massage my scalp right now.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.960]   I'm no doubt increasing blood flow to certain areas.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.620]   I'm probably decreasing blood flow to the areas
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.800]   I'm pushing down on, but it's all temporary.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.000]   I don't know many people that can massage their scalp enough
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.440]   during the day or long enough during the day, rather,
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.400]   that it would sufficiently increase blood flow.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.800]   With that said, it is clear that increasing blood flow
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.040]   to the scalp by way of reducing hypertension,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.600]   which is effectively accomplished by broadening,
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.200]   by expanding the blood vessels and capillaries,
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.040]   is an effective way to at least hold on
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.800]   to the hair that you have.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.200]   Is it going to completely halt hair loss?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.080]   If you have a strong genetic bias towards hair loss, no.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.800]   Is it going to reverse hair loss?
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.260]   Very unlikely that it will,
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.840]   but it can slow hair loss
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.160]   or even maintain the hair that you have.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.080]   So if we were to take a step back and ask ourselves
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.320]   what other sorts of drug treatments are out there
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.900]   besides minoxidil that increase blood flow
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.040]   and that might increase the rates of hair growth
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   or more likely increase maintenance of hair
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.700]   that one already has by increasing blood flow to the niche.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.120]   And nowadays, there are more and more doctors
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.200]   who are familiar with this requirement for blood flow,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.760]   understand the mechanisms by which minoxidil works,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.620]   and understand the vast desire out there
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.080]   for people to hold on to the hair they have and regrow hair.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   And they're prescribing things like low dose tadalafil.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.900]   So 2.5 milligram to five milligram tadalafil.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.960]   Tadalafil was initially discovered
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.280]   as a drug to treat prostate health.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.240]   It was a drug that we now know
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.020]   can increase blood flow to the prostate
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.560]   and thereby offset some of the issues
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.060]   associated with an aging prostate.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:18.560]   Higher doses of tadalafil, sometimes also referred to
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.320]   by its brand name, which is Cialis,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.400]   are used to treat erectile dysfunction,
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.740]   but at the dosages that are used
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.720]   to increase blood flow to the prostate
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.660]   and that now a number of doctors
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.320]   are using to increase blood flow, not just to the prostate,
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.020]   but to all regions of the body, including the scalp,
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.600]   such as 2.5 to five milligrams tadalafil.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.400]   So this is something that I think deserves attention
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.100]   because it falls under the umbrella
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.560]   of increasing blood flow to the hair stem cell niche
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.700]   in order to maintain hair.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.120]   It is not something that most doctors
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.840]   are going to be familiar with as the way to reverse hair loss
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.420]   because it won't do that.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.800]   But the use of low dose tadalafil to slow rates of hair loss
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.280]   is very much in a logical mechanistic sense,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.900]   exactly the same as the logic of using minoxidil
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.280]   to slow rates of hair loss.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.360]   It's all about increasing blood flow
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.160]   to support the stem cell niche below the hair follicle.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.280]   The critical requirement for blood flow, oxygen,
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.040]   and nutrients to the stem cell niche
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.300]   is also why you hear a lot nowadays
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.340]   about the use of PRP, platelet-rich plasma,
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:27.480]   for trying to offset hair loss or even reverse hair loss.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.260]   We're going to do an entire episode about PRP.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.580]   It is pretty controversial in certain circles
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.800]   and well-accepted in other circles.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.920]   A couple of key things to understand about PRP.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.320]   First of all, it is being used in multiple tissues
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.640]   for different purposes in different clinics.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   So for instance, board-certified physicians
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.720]   in the United States, Canada, and Europe
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.000]   are doing PRP injections into ovaries
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.440]   to try and expand the number of healthy follicles and eggs
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.120]   so that people can conceive later in life,
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.360]   or even earlier in life if they don't have any follicles.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.960]   People are getting PRP injections into their joints
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.640]   in order to try and support joint health.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.120]   People are getting PRP injections
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   into just about every tissue you can think of.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.840]   However, PRP, despite what you may have heard,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.340]   is not stem cells.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.940]   Somebody tells you they're injecting stem cells.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.000]   They're either outside the US, Canada, or Northern Europe,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.720]   or they're injecting something else.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.100]   So you want to really look into that.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.200]   The safety issues there are the subject
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.920]   totally deserving of an entire episode.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.480]   I'm not necessarily opposed to the future of stem cells
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.960]   as a treatment, but keep in mind
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.480]   that stem cells are cells that can give rise
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.640]   to lots of other cell types,
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.540]   and they are cells that divide and replicate,
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.480]   and there's a name for that when it happens
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.320]   in the adult body when you don't want that,
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.840]   and that's called cancer.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.280]   Tumors are overproduction of cells from stem cells
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.560]   when those stem cells ordinarily should be quiescent, okay?
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.040]   So keep in mind the difference between stem cells and PRP.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.360]   PRP, platelet-rich plasma, again, is legal in the US
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.720]   and many other places
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.120]   because it involves drawing somebody's blood,
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.720]   spinning it down at a particular speed,
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.620]   which separates out different components within the blood,
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:12.280]   then taking the platelets and re-injecting those
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.680]   in a solution back into the person's body.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   So platelet-rich plasma, or PRP,
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.020]   is platelet-enriched plasma from that person.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.840]   But the basis of PRP is really to encourage
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.880]   nutrient delivery to a particular region in the body
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.980]   using somebody's own platelets
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.400]   because those platelets are enriched for various nutrients.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.560]   So people are getting PRP injections into their scalp.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.960]   Those are not stem cell injections.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.560]   Those are PRP injections into the scalp
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.660]   with some moderate success.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.400]   These are very expensive treatments.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.160]   They tend to be transiently successful.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.800]   I'm sure there are people out there who are going to say,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.120]   "PRP worked fabulously well for me."
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.240]   That might be the case.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.620]   I'm not going to dispute that, and I'm happy for you,
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.480]   although there are not sufficient clinical data
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.360]   to suggest PRP as a treatment right now,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.480]   especially given the cost.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.140]   Many thousands of dollars, many, many treatments.
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.120]   It's also the case that the PRP injections,
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.760]   when they work, might work for reasons
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.120]   independent of the platelets.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.940]   What do I mean by that?
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.600]   Well, soon we're going to talk about
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.800]   a different type of treatment,
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.560]   which is a mechanical manipulation of the hair follicle,
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.380]   typically on the scalp,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.080]   'cause that's typically where people want to regrow hair.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.280]   I don't know many people who are trying to maintain
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.040]   or accelerate or regrow their back hair, for instance.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   They might be out there,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.440]   but I don't think there are a lot of them,
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.400]   or their leg hair, for that matter.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.180]   Almost always, it's going to be scalp hair.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.000]   And one way that people are doing that
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.520]   is through mechanical stimulation of the hair follicle
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.320]   and the stem cell niche using what's called microneedling.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   Microneedling, as the name suggests,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.800]   is taking a bunch of little needles,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.680]   either in a little stamp, so a little square,
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.000]   or nowadays, typically it's a roller,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.720]   so it looks like a paint roller,
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.400]   except it's got tons of little needles in rows
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.440]   all over that roller.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.880]   Those needles range in length from half a millimeter
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.240]   to 2.5 millimeters, okay, millimeters.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.260]   And one rolls that over the scalp,
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.360]   and if you're thinking, "Ouch, that probably hurts,"
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.560]   indeed, it can hurt a little bit or a lot,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.160]   depending on the thickness and the length of those needles.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.920]   Microneedling has been shown to do two things.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.760]   It has been shown to reactivate
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.440]   semiquiescent populations of stem cells
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.640]   that are in that telogen phase,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.400]   putting them back in antigen phase,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.660]   and thereby stimulate more hair growth.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.280]   It has also, and this is, I think,
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.960]   the best use of microneedling,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.320]   it has also been shown to be a very effective augment
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.740]   for some of the hormone-based hair regrowth tools
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.760]   and pharmacology that we're going to talk about
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.720]   in a few minutes.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.340]   So microneedling and PRP have something very critical
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.680]   and common, which is the needle,
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   the actual injection into the skin.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.320]   And for those of you that are hearing this and thinking,
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.540]   "Why would disrupting the skin with needles
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.880]   actually support hair growth or regrowth?
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.040]   Wouldn't that just damage the follicle?"
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.340]   Well, this gets into some of the, I think, interesting,
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.180]   if not fascinating aspects of our biology,
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.360]   which is that all of the cells in our body
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.400]   really can respond to both chemical and mechanical cues.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.960]   And when we hear needle injected in the skin,
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.800]   we think, "Ah, that must just be damaging everything,
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.700]   causing all sorts of inflammation."
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.300]   But it turns out that low levels of inflammation
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.500]   caused by things like microneedling or PRP injections,
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.340]   or even the introduction of any kind of fluid, right?
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.040]   For instance, saline fluid injected into a region
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.220]   can cause changes in the cells in that region,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.760]   causing, for instance, stem cell populations
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.900]   that were waning to reactivate again,
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.420]   causing telogen phase follicles that have melanocytes
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.440]   and stem cells that are dying off, but not completely gone,
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.120]   to reenter the cell cycle.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.620]   So microneedling procedures, PRP injections,
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.240]   things like minoxidil, they all kind of center
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.900]   around this same general theme of increasing blood flow,
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.180]   increasing oxygen, delivery of nutrients,
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.840]   or in the case of microneedling,
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.900]   increasing inflammation just enough at that local site
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.160]   that certain cascades of biological function
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.140]   that relate to proliferation of stem cells
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.100]   or maintenance of stem cell populations are kicked off.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.400]   It's sort of like reminding the cells in that area
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.580]   that they need to stay alive
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.120]   in order to replenish whatever is lost.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.360]   So sometimes a wound can actually induce some healing,
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.600]   although I do want to point out
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.140]   that the micro part of microneedling is absolutely key.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.480]   And this should be obvious to you
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.920]   when you think about scars.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.760]   I don't know about you,
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.980]   but I've never seen a scar with hair growing out of it.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.960]   Or if there was, it was probably like one hair.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.920]   But if you've ever seen a scar,
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.240]   someone had their appendix out
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.000]   or someone had a brain surgery,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.260]   you see that scar because there is no hair growing out of it.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.580]   So the micro portion of microneedling
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.580]   is extremely important.
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:02.180]   We are not talking about causing significant damage
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.060]   to a tissue in order to activate that stem cell population.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.100]   We're talking about causing micro damage
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.680]   and micro levels of inflammation to stimulate growth.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.620]   For those of you that are interested in using microneedling
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.700]   or microneedling in combination with chemical treatments
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.400]   like minoxidil or some of the other treatments
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.380]   we'll talk about in a little bit,
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.800]   like finasteride and caffeine.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.760]   Yes, believe it or not,
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.680]   caffeine is being used to regrow hair.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.060]   Very interesting, get into that in a moment.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.280]   But if you're interested in using microneedling alone
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.780]   or in combination with some of these other treatments,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.760]   there's a wonderful review
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.680]   that was just published this last year.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.140]   Wonderful because it's very comprehensive.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.940]   Not so wonderful, not to the fault of the authors
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.500]   because most of the studies out there on microneedling
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.820]   are not superb.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.300]   There are ways of gauging the strength of a study,
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.500]   mainly related to their duration,
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.740]   whether or not there were control groups, et cetera.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.580]   But the review itself is excellent.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.260]   The title of the review is "Microneedling and its Use
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.700]   in Hair Loss Disorders," a systematic review.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.300]   We will provide a link to this in the show note captions.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.600]   And this review did a very good job
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.760]   of highlighting both the strengths and drawbacks
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.060]   of the various studies looking at microneedling.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.260]   It also explored the use of microneedling
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:14.180]   in both men and women and of various ages.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.700]   And it does appear to be the case
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.200]   that microneedling shows some positive benefit
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.300]   in both men and women, regardless of age,
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.800]   especially when used in combination
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.220]   with the various other treatments that we're talking about.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.960]   I was also able to glean from this review
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.420]   and some of the papers described within it
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.540]   that needle lengths of about one millimeter to 2.5 millimeters
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.460]   seem to be more effective than shorter needle lengths.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.620]   So if you're scared of the needles and the needle lengths,
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.200]   keep in mind that done properly,
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.460]   microneedling shouldn't be too painful.
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.660]   Some people experience a little bit more pain than others,
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.320]   but it's not considered a very painful procedure.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.720]   It is, however, a procedure
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.260]   that can cause some bleeding of the scalp
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.000]   and that bleeding of the scalp can be very apparent,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.780]   especially if it's in the front of the head
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:00.180]   as opposed to in the top of the head and hidden by some hair
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:04.300]   or if you're already quite bald in a given region.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.940]   So keep that in mind.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.500]   I suppose one could wear a hat or a wig
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.320]   or something of that sort
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.980]   if they were really self-conscious about it.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:14.220]   But the microneedling itself is causing a physical disruption
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.140]   to the scalp, some degree of bleeding, inflammation,
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.660]   and again, all of that is part of the process
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.820]   by which microneedling can actually improve hair growth.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.700]   And of course, there's healing that occurs
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.860]   of the bleeding and the damage to the follicle.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.260]   This is a transient thing,
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.460]   but understanding the cosmetic implications
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.740]   in the short term as well as in the long term
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.320]   is certainly worth knowing.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.300]   One thing that's very clear
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.900]   is that the combination of microneedling
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:40.240]   and minoxidil treatment together is far more effective
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.500]   than either of those treatments alone.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.420]   In addition, the combination of microneedling and minoxidil
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.700]   has been shown to be effective
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.540]   in recovering what are called dead zones.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.420]   So these are regions of the scalp
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.000]   that are either completely bald or mostly bald
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.860]   for which there is essentially no stem cell population there
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.140]   and the combination of minoxidil plus microneedling
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.740]   is somehow able to recover those stem cell populations
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.160]   and allow new hair to grow.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.260]   Although the growth of that hair in those dead zone regions
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:13.160]   can take a very long time, 30 to even 50 weeks.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.860]   Neither minoxidil treatment alone nor microneedling alone
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.140]   has been shown to be effective
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   in recovering these so-called dead zones
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.440]   when those treatments are done separately.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.580]   So this, I would say, is a strong reason
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.760]   to consider combining microneedling and minoxidil
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.100]   as opposed to just doing minoxidil or just microneedling.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.100]   I should also mention that minoxidil treatment,
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.120]   if you pursue it, is likely something
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.840]   that you are going to have to do for the rest of your life
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.060]   if you want to hold on to the hair growth
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.100]   that you obtain with minoxidil,
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.600]   or if you want to maintain the hair
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.280]   that you are already maintaining with minoxidil.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.720]   Some people have been successful in taking minoxidil,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.840]   maintaining some hair growth
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.340]   or even stimulating some hair growth
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.700]   and then coming off minoxidil,
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.000]   but most everyone who goes on minoxidil
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.560]   has to stay on minoxidil
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.700]   because when they cease taking minoxidil,
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.420]   even if they're doing other treatments,
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.640]   they lose the hair that they gained with minoxidil.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.620]   So that is an important consideration.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.960]   The decision to go on minoxidil
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.120]   is likely a decision to be on minoxidil
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.580]   for the rest of your life.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.180]   I'd like to just take a brief break
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.040]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.680]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.320]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.140]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.320]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.820]   are critical to the function of all the cells in your body,
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.480]   in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.680]   also called neurons.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.320]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.540]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.120]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.640]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.760]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram, of sodium,
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.160]   200 milligrams of potassium,
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.280]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.320]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.460]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.240]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.500]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.000]   and after physical training as well,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.760]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.600]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.080]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.760]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.720]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.320]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.640]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.780]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.620]   So as you're probably starting to realize,
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.160]   there's a relationship between mechanical stimulation
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.120]   of the follicle and blood flow,
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.200]   both of which turn out to be critical for maintaining hair
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.580]   and for stimulating hair growth.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.880]   Not surprisingly then,
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.060]   an increasingly common treatment for hair loss is Botox.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.080]   Botox is the brand name for what is otherwise known
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.520]   as botulinum neurotoxin.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.500]   What is botulinum neurotoxin?
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.940]   Well, botulinum neurotoxin,
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.200]   sometimes just called botulinum for short,
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.160]   is a toxin that's a bacterial toxin
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.840]   that serves to cut the protein
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.600]   that leads to synaptic vesicle release.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.360]   What in the world did I just say?
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.040]   Well, when your nerve cells communicate with one another,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.600]   they do that by way of electricity,
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.660]   but the electricity within those nerve cells, those neurons,
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.240]   triggers the release of chemicals from neurons
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.720]   into the synapse, the little gap between neurons.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.640]   And the release of those chemicals
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.120]   allows the next neuron to be chemically active,
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.440]   or in some cases,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.000]   it will suppress the electrical activity of that next neuron.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.120]   Botulinum neurotoxin serves to cut a protein
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.640]   present in neurons
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.160]   so that neurons cannot release the chemicals
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.780]   that cause other neurons to be active.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.620]   So this actually is pretty serious.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.220]   If you were to get botulinum neurotoxin injected
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.780]   into your muscle, you would be paralyzed
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.180]   because the nerves that control contraction of the muscles
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.480]   would not be able to control the release of that chemical
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.640]   onto the muscle, which makes it contract.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.380]   Botulinum neurotoxin is commonly used
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.760]   in what's called a Botox.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.120]   Botox is something most people are familiar with
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.480]   because people get it injected in and around their wrinkles,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.100]   because many wrinkles are triggered
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.400]   by not just loss of tensile strength in the skin,
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.600]   but rather the nerves around the skin and in the skin
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.160]   are hypercontracted, which causes wrinkles.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.800]   So for instance, I have crow's feet.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.580]   I like to think that's because I've laughed a lot
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.640]   and smiled a lot,
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.520]   and it's probably also because I've squinted a lot
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.900]   in my lifetime.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.320]   I have crow's feet because the nerves there
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.800]   have pinched the skin on either side of my eyes,
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.000]   and that's given me little creases there
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.140]   that are sometimes referred to as crow's feet.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:39.220]   Botox injections can be applied to the scalp
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.660]   in order to relieve tension of the scalp.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.200]   And in hearing that, it should be obvious
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.820]   why Botox is being used to try and offset hair loss.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.280]   It's decreasing the squinting, if you will,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.960]   or the tensile nature of the scalp skin
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.920]   so that more blood flow can arrive
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.100]   at that stem cell follicle area.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.880]   So Botox treatment to the scalp
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.960]   is actually becoming pretty common.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.160]   There are a couple of requirements
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.200]   with this Botox treatment.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.160]   First of all, it has to be done
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.040]   by somebody who's really skilled.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.260]   There are numerous images online and websites online
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.160]   of so-called Botox fails,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.880]   where people have gotten too much Botox
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.360]   or the injections have been done too deep
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.920]   or not at the correct locations on people's face or scalp,
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.360]   and it can give them droopy scalp or droopy eyes,
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.060]   all sorts of cosmetic nightmares can occur with Botox.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:29.000]   The second thing to understand
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.360]   is that Botox does eventually wear off.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.420]   That botulinum neurotoxin doesn't stick around forever,
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.920]   and provided it's done correctly at the correct dosages,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.480]   it doesn't actually kill the neurons
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.820]   that cause that tension of the skin.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:44.000]   So Botox injections have to be done repeatedly.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.960]   The efficacy of Botox for offsetting hair loss is not clear.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.080]   There aren't a lot of large-scale clinical studies
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.160]   on this just yet,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.200]   but it does seem to be at least
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.940]   one reasonably safe alternative to things like minoxidil.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.000]   Although I think if one were to just want
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.840]   to increase blood flow to the scalp,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.740]   things like low-dose tadalafil,
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.800]   which doesn't seem to carry any of the side effects
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.760]   that minoxidil can carry,
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.580]   we talked about those side effects earlier,
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.680]   that would probably be the better alternative.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.900]   Botox is a fairly invasive procedure,
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.040]   but some people opt for Botox treatment.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   In fact, there is a syndrome called cutis verticus gyrata.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.680]   Some of you have probably seen this.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.660]   It's more typical in men, although it does occur in women.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.560]   It literally means a lumping of the skin on the scalp
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.760]   or gyri of the scalp.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.280]   Gyri or gyrus pertains to the Latin word "mi,"
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.540]   so it means bump or knee.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.280]   And so anytime you hear the word gyra in neuroscience
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.240]   or in biology, you're talking about a bump.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.300]   Sometimes see people will have ridges in the back
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.440]   where it looks as if the skin was pushed together,
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.920]   kind of like a Sharpay dog, but on the scalp.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.240]   People with cutis verticus gyrata
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.040]   almost always experience pattern hair loss.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.360]   Now, part of the reason for that is cutis verticus gyrata
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.160]   is also associated with some androgen
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.400]   or testosterone-related hormone issues
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.080]   that we'll talk about in a little bit.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.700]   But in addition to that,
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.560]   it has been shown that relieving some of those gyrata
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.600]   by injections of Botox to allow those folds to sit flatter,
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.880]   A, is effective.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.600]   It can lead to less of those gyri, those bumps,
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   and can improve hair growth in those regions
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.200]   even if those people don't take on any additional treatments
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.800]   to address the hormone issues.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.960]   So that's really how people arrived at this understanding
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.520]   that Botox might be a good treatment in general
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.880]   for reducing the kind of squinting of the scalp
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.160]   that can occur and the resulting hair loss in those regions.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.460]   I'd now like to turn our attention
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.160]   to the chemical variables
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.800]   that control the duration of the growth phase of hair,
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.520]   the duration of that catagen phase,
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.760]   which is when that hair essentially recedes
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.880]   from the inside out,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.920]   and the quiescent or semiquiescent telogen phase.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.120]   There are a couple of key chemical players here
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.520]   that we should all be aware of.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.460]   First of all, the growth factor IGF-1,
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.740]   insulin growth factor one, which is produced by the liver,
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.480]   but that receives stimulation from the brain and pituitary
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.480]   to be released, is a strong regulator of hair growth.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.060]   And we can think of it as the accelerator on hair growth.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.600]   So it does that by extending that antigen
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.120]   or growth phase for longer.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.140]   It doesn't necessarily speed up growth,
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.480]   but it extends it for a longer period of time.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.600]   In addition, cyclic AMP,
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.000]   which is part of what's called a second messenger pathway,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.940]   in fact, cyclic AMP is a second messenger,
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.760]   is also a key player in stimulating growth
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.920]   of the hair follicle.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.800]   Now, cyclic AMP does many different things
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.700]   in many different cell types in the body.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.040]   It really acts, as the name suggests,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.300]   as a messenger between signals
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.660]   that arrive at the surface of cells
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.680]   and transmitting or conveying those signals
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.860]   to things that happen deep within the cells,
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.060]   such as the turning on and off of various genes.
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.540]   So when you hear second messenger,
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.540]   don't let that confuse you or overwhelm you.
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.060]   Just understand that the whole process
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.140]   of getting signals from the outside of cells
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.780]   into the center of cells and controlling gene expression,
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.260]   for instance, causing a stem cell
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.860]   to continue to give off daughter cells
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.940]   or causing a hair cell to continue growing for longer,
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.140]   that whole process is a bit like a bucket brigade
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.880]   of handing off water or a bucket
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.760]   from one component to the next or along a chain.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.880]   It's like an assembly line.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.160]   I think that's probably the simplest way to think about it.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.820]   So for sake of this discussion,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.900]   IGF-1 is known to increase the growth of hair
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:40.720]   by extending that antigen phase, as is cyclic AMP.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.320]   So those are going to be considered the accelerators,
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.660]   at least in this conversation.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.700]   The breaks on hair growth are going to be the things
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.800]   that either shorten the antigen phase
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.600]   or that extend the catagen phase or this quiescent phase,
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.660]   which is the telogen phase.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.480]   And the two major breaks on hair growth
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.720]   that we want to think about are PDE,
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.680]   which is a phosphodiesterase, okay?
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.920]   Anytime you hear ACE, it's likely to be an enzyme,
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.480]   and TGF-beta-2, all right?
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.560]   So this is a particular growth factor
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.920]   that somewhat counterintuitively doesn't stimulate growth.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.800]   It actually stimulates lack of growth or shortens growth.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.220]   So with all of that in mind,
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.960]   and please do also keep in mind
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.900]   that you don't need to remember all those specific terms.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.760]   Just understand that there are some factors
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   like insulin growth factor,
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.700]   one that act as accelerators on growth,
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.820]   and there are factors that act as breaks on growth.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.960]   We can start to think about why, for instance,
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.520]   half of all people by age 50 start to lose their hair.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.740]   Well, they start to lose their hair
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.080]   because of something called androgen-related alopecia,
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.160]   which translated to English means
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.680]   testosterone and testosterone derivative-induced hair loss.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.500]   This is true in men and women.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.340]   So hearing that,
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.840]   you should probably be wondering the following thing.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.500]   Young men have higher levels of testosterone
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.480]   than old men, right?
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.000]   Well, the answer is yes, although some older men
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.400]   in their 40s, 50s, even 80s maintain testosterone levels
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.620]   similar to many men in their 20s, but most don't.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.000]   It's a downward slope starting at about age 40.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.480]   How steep that downward slope is depends.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.160]   Women too have testosterone.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.200]   In fact, women have higher levels of testosterone
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.000]   than they do estrogen.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.200]   That's right.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.640]   A healthy woman has higher levels of testosterone
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.140]   than she does estrogen.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.500]   However, women on average have lower testosterone
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.020]   than most men, okay?
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.240]   So they still have far more estrogen
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.860]   and far less testosterone than most men,
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.220]   but the level of testosterone that they have
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.940]   within their body is higher
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.740]   than the level of estrogen they have.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:53.140]   Androgens, such as testosterone and its derivatives,
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:55.660]   such as dihydrotestosterone,
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.880]   which will be much the topic
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.020]   of what we're getting into next,
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.100]   inhibit IGF-1 and cyclic AMP.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.460]   Again, androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone,
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.680]   inhibit, prevent the action of IGF-1 and cyclic AMP,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.940]   which you just learned a few moments ago,
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.340]   act to extend the antigen or growth phase of hair,
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.840]   which then raises the question,
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.400]   well, if young people, both male and female,
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.220]   have higher levels of testosterone
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.060]   than they do when they're older,
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.600]   why would people lose their hair
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.740]   when they're older and not younger?
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.460]   Ah, the answer lies in the conversion of testosterone
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.860]   to dihydrotestosterone.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.740]   Testosterone, most people have heard of.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.540]   Dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, is made from testosterone.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.380]   There's an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.780]   that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.180]   in both men and women.
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.840]   Dihydrotestosterone binds to the androgen receptor
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.500]   at five times the affinity of testosterone.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.880]   So it is the most powerful androgen in humans,
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.140]   and it is responsible for a number of things
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.400]   that we all really want and like,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.340]   such as mental vigor, physical vigor,
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:12.340]   strength, healing capacity, drive, libido, and on and on.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.620]   So DHT itself is not bad.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.820]   So if we take a step back and we acknowledge
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.420]   testosterone levels are higher in males and females
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.220]   at younger ages as opposed to older,
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.440]   but as they get older,
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.080]   there is more 5-alpha reductase activity,
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.940]   which is converting more of that testosterone
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.360]   to dihydrotestosterone,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.800]   and dihydrotestosterone inhibits hair growth
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.320]   by reducing IGF-1 and cyclic AMP,
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.180]   well, then we should all be aboard why it is that by age 50,
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.780]   about 50% of people experience pattern hair loss.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.040]   That is androgen-dependent alopecia, okay?
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.000]   But translated to normal English is pattern hair loss.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.680]   And in a moment, you'll understand why
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.840]   some people lose their hair from the crown region,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.500]   in the back of the head or back and top of the head,
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.420]   whereas other people lose their hair
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.220]   in the front of their head,
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.940]   in the flanks right on either side of the midline
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.100]   or maybe in the midline and front altogether.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.200]   And that's because different people,
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.220]   depending on their genetic lineage,
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.360]   have different patterns of androgen receptors
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.820]   on their scalp.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.860]   And the pattern of androgen receptors that you inherit
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.740]   indeed does come from your mother's side.
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.140]   And so this is what gave rise to the myth
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.320]   that if you want to know if you're going to go bald or not,
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.300]   just look at your mother's father.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.420]   Doesn't quite work that way.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.860]   In fact, if you think about the logic,
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.460]   you should really look at your mother's mother
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:36.100]   if you want to know your pattern of androgen receptors
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:36.940]   on your scalp.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.160]   However, most women don't lose as much hair
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.460]   from their scalp or they have ways
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.360]   of covering up the hair loss in their scalp
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.080]   because their hair is just generally longer
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.620]   or they're using other approaches
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.580]   so that you never really get a clear picture
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.760]   of what the androgen-dependent hair loss was
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.040]   in your grandmother, okay?
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.300]   Now, we don't want to go too far down
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.540]   the genetics rabbit hole because, as you know,
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.740]   you can't select your parents anyway.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   But if you want to know why, for instance,
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.580]   I'm losing a bit of hair on either side of the midline
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:08.220]   in the front, it almost certainly has to do with the fact
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.940]   that I have a higher density of androgen receptors there
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.900]   as opposed to, say, on the crown of my head
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.600]   where, for whatever reason, my hair seems to grow thickest.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.980]   Other people lose hair on the crown in the back and top,
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:22.280]   but not in the front, and some people lose it all over.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.520]   Now you understand why hair loss occurs
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.720]   in certain regions of the body.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.540]   You should also understand that the androgen receptors
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.260]   on the face are also what are responsible for beard growth.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.000]   And this is where it can get a little bit tricky,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.620]   but a lot of things will start to make sense
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.480]   if you can understand this and internalize this.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.800]   If you have a high density of androgen receptors
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.600]   on your face, well then, as your DHT levels go up with age,
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.500]   you will be able to grow a thicker and thicker beard.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.040]   In fact, it is rare to see someone who can grow a thick beard
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.520]   in their youth, but not so much as they get older.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.300]   In fact, the reverse tends to be true.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.200]   So the pattern of androgen receptors differs
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   between the scalp and the face and the back, okay?
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.080]   On your back, you have androgen receptors,
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   and there, DHT stimulates hair growth.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080]   So if you know someone who has a very hairy back,
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.640]   or if you have a very hairy back,
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.540]   that means you have a high density
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.400]   of androgen receptors on your back.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.240]   If you have a beard and that beard is thick, well then,
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.000]   you have a high density of androgen receptors on your face.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.740]   However, a high density of androgen receptors anywhere
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.620]   on your scalp is going to predispose those regions
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.740]   to androgen-dependent alopecia or hair loss
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.520]   in those particular regions,
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.180]   which is going to allow us to understand why all
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.700]   of the rest of the treatments for halting hair loss
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.400]   and for stimulating hair growth,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.240]   almost all of those center on inhibiting either DHT directly
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.700]   or 5-alpha reductase, the conversion of testosterone to DHT.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.980]   So now I'd like to discuss the ways
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.720]   that one can chemically adjust certain things
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.240]   within the hair growth pathway,
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.480]   things like IGF-1, PDE, TGF-beta, et cetera,
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.620]   in order to stimulate hair growth or halt hair loss.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.200]   The first thing on this list is actually going
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.420]   to be pretty surprising to a number of you,
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.200]   and that's caffeine.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.760]   We all think of caffeine as a stimulant that we drink.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.820]   I certainly drink coffee and yerba mate,
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.960]   the occasional energy drink, things of that sort.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.420]   Caffeine does many things besides stimulate
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.780]   our central nervous system and make us feel less sleepy.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.800]   However, one of the things that caffeine does
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:24.600]   is it is a fairly potent PDE inhibitor.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.800]   By being a potent PDE inhibitor,
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.680]   it indirectly stimulates IGF-1.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.520]   Why?
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.960]   Well, because PDE can suppress IGF-1,
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.280]   and by ingesting caffeine
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.180]   or by applying topical caffeine ointment
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.040]   or cream to the scalp, you can suppress PDE sufficiently
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.440]   enough to increase IGF-1 and increase some hair growth
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.880]   or at least maintain hair growth in that region.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.360]   This may come as a shock.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.320]   It might seem a little bit esoteric
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.480]   or even outside the margins of typical treatments,
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.380]   but head-to-head topical caffeine application
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.320]   can be as effective as minoxidil application
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.000]   without actually lowering things like blood pressure
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.040]   and potentially increasing prolactin
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.720]   and some of the other negative, let's call them negative
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.620]   because they are side effects of minoxidil.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.760]   So caffeine ointments and caffeine present
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.640]   in various hair treatments and creams, et cetera,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.700]   is starting to become a more prominent theme out there.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.240]   I will include a reference to caffeine
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.260]   and its uses for offsetting hair loss.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.120]   Keep in mind that topical caffeine ointments
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.660]   shouldn't necessarily be applied every single day.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.960]   So this is the sort of thing you might do
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.220]   three times a week.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.140]   The concentration of caffeine in different ointments
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.540]   varies tremendously.
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:43.920]   Most of the studies of caffeine on the stem cell niches
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   that control hair growth
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.300]   and extension of the antigen phase of hair growth
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.320]   have been performed in vitro in a dish.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.620]   Although there are some clinical studies exploring this,
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.640]   they are not nearly as extensive in number or duration
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.020]   as the studies of minoxidil
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.740]   because this approach just hasn't been around quite as long.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.300]   However, when comparing side effects of minoxidil,
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.740]   cost of minoxidil,
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.260]   comparing the efficacy of caffeine and minoxidil,
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.320]   I think caffeine as a topical treatment
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.980]   for offsetting hair loss
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.660]   stands as a pretty good choice
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.980]   if you're going to start exploring this pathway.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   And there's no reason to think
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.880]   that if you were to try the caffeine ointment
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   and it didn't work for you,
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.160]   or you didn't like it for some reason,
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.980]   or you needed to stop it for some reason,
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.400]   that you couldn't stop it safely
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.540]   because it doesn't carry all the other
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.240]   kind of blood pressure related effects
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.260]   and prolactinemia effects that minoxidil does.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.900]   So if you look out there into the hair maintenance
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.220]   and hair replacement literature,
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.580]   you look at the treatments that are being sold,
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.740]   don't be surprised to see caffeine there.
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:40.020]   And also don't be surprised when I tell you
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.020]   what I'm about to tell you now,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.980]   which is no, you can't simply just drink more caffeine
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.440]   in order to accomplish the goal of offsetting hair loss.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.100]   It is true that when you ingest caffeine,
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.460]   it goes systemically.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.180]   However, you have so many adenosine receptors
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.060]   throughout your body,
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.860]   those adenosine receptors and the parking of caffeine
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:58.940]   in those adenosine receptors is the main way
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.280]   in which caffeine exerts its stimulatory effects,
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.260]   making you feel less sleepy.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.700]   So it does that because then adenosine
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.360]   can't have its effects, which are to make you sleepy.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.200]   Well, those adenosine receptors soak up
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.840]   so much of the caffeine that you would ingest orally
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.820]   that very, very little would make it to the scalp
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.100]   and to the hair follicles
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.740]   at the concentrations that you would want.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.780]   So that's why you have to rely on the application
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:26.100]   of these caffeine ointments about three times a week.
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.940]   Keep in mind that no one has really explored the dosages
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:31.300]   of caffeine in these ointments in a systematic way.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.660]   We're still in the early stages of all this,
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.380]   but I do think it's important to mention caffeine
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.000]   because of the lower incidence of side effects,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.260]   at least reported side effects,
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:42.380]   and the general safety margins and the head-to-head,
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.580]   essentially comparable efficacy with minoxidil
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.940]   because minoxidil has a bunch of other issues.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.800]   Now, keep in mind that both minoxidil and caffeine
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.380]   are generally used as a preventative
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:55.260]   for reducing hair loss over time.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:59.660]   They are not expected and they do not, as far as we know,
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:03.200]   create new hair growth to any sufficient degree.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.020]   If any of you have used caffeine ointments
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.420]   or minoxidil and observed new hair growth that was robust,
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.780]   please put that in the comment section.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.700]   I'd be curious about those experiences.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.540]   But as far as I know,
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.720]   and from the clinical literature that I read,
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.340]   there's no examples of that.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.100]   One other point about caffeine,
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.540]   it does appear that caffeine can not only
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.180]   indirectly stimulate IGF-1 in the antigen phase
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:27.380]   of hair cell growth by way of reducing PDE and TGF-beta,
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.140]   but it also seems to reduce apoptosis,
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.140]   which is naturally occurring cell death
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.660]   of that stem cell niche.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:34.980]   We've been talking a lot about the antigen
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.120]   or growth phase of hair.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.740]   We also talked about the catagen,
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.420]   or the recession of that hair from the inside out.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.740]   But remember that third phase, the telogen phase,
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.520]   where that whole bulb down at the bottom,
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.540]   the bulges it's called, gets pinched off
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.420]   and the whole thing dies
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.860]   and takes the stem cells off to the grave with it.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.420]   It appears that caffeine can offset the death of that niche
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.860]   and potentially maintain the stem cell population longer,
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.820]   making caffeine a really good choice to think about
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.300]   in conjunction with the various chemical treatments
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.380]   aimed at directly attacking the DHT pathway
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:06.780]   that we'll talk about next.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.620]   So there's one very direct way to increase hair growth
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.460]   and maintain the hair that you have on your head,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.080]   and that's to increase IGF-1.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.860]   That can be accomplished through prescription drugs,
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:21.240]   such as growth hormone and things that stimulate
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.920]   the release of growth hormone and IGF-1.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.480]   Keep in mind, growth hormone is released
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.900]   from the anterior pituitary during the first hours of sleep,
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.620]   especially when you haven't eaten anything
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.780]   for the two hours prior to sleep,
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.780]   and especially when you get regular bedtimes.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.440]   Yes, this is a real thing.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.480]   If you are going to sleep at variable bedtimes,
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.080]   especially if you go to sleep much later
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.020]   than your usual habitual bedtime,
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.820]   you will miss that growth hormone pulse
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.840]   that normally occurs in the first two to three hours
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.680]   of sleep.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.220]   This does not mean that you need to be neurotic
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.260]   about getting to sleep at the exact same time every night.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.560]   There's probably a plus or minus 30 minute window,
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.520]   and it doesn't mean that you can't stay out late
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.000]   or have a bad night's sleep every once in a while
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.200]   or get woken up.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.720]   Your hair isn't going to fall out.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.320]   My dad's story notwithstanding.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.280]   Your hair isn't going to all fall out because of that,
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.720]   but you do want to try and get
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.960]   that natural growth hormone release each night,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   and as I mentioned, there are prescription approaches,
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.520]   and those are growth hormone itself
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.800]   and things like sermorelin,
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.120]   which is a peptide that increases growth hormone.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.920]   It's actually a secretogog.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.480]   It causes the secretion of growth hormone
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.680]   and thereby increases in IGF-1.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.000]   This is well-documented.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.640]   Both growth hormone and IGF-1, as I mentioned,
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.280]   are available by prescription.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.760]   They are not without their side effects.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.980]   So they do cause growth of all tissues.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.760]   They do increase height in children.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.900]   They increase bone mass and density.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.400]   They can increase mainly fat loss, not so much muscle size,
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.120]   but they can increase leanness,
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.800]   and they increase hair growth.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.400]   They can increase turnover of skin.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.860]   They can make skin look more youthful.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.680]   All these things sound wonderful,
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.060]   and yet they also have problems
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.740]   because they can increase growth of small tumors
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.040]   that normally might be eliminated.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.200]   So there is an increased cancer risk
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.200]   with growth hormone treatments in IGF-1
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.120]   or anything that increases IGF-1,
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.400]   such as sermorelin, ipramarolin,
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.880]   any of the peptides that you hear about nowadays.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.040]   That said, a number of people are using sermorelin
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.660]   as an indirect way to increase IGF-1
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.200]   and thereby to increase hair growth.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   It does seem to be fairly effective in doing that,
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.680]   especially when done in conjunction
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.360]   with other treatments that we'll talk about,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   but keep in mind, these are prescription drugs
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.220]   and they do carry their own risks.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.500]   The other thing about stimulating
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.560]   the natural production of IGF-1
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.920]   is that as its name suggests, insulin growth factor one,
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.360]   it is insulin dependent in many ways,
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.640]   if not for its secretion,
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.560]   then for its action at the hair, follicle, and stem cell.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   So one of the things you really want to pay attention to
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.560]   is to avoid being insulin resistant,
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.520]   or rather you want to try to be insulin sensitive.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.840]   So if you're carrying a lot of excess body fat,
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.440]   if you're obese, or if you have type two diabetes,
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.620]   meaning you're insulin resistant,
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.120]   you're going to want to deal with that.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.320]   There are a number of prescription treatments
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.240]   to deal with that.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.640]   Nowadays, people are very excited
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.320]   about all the GLP-1 agonists,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.000]   but in addition to that,
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.240]   regular cardiovascular exercise and resistance exercise,
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.040]   making sure that your body fat percentage
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.300]   is not in excess of where it needs to be,
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.720]   and everyone has a slightly different idea
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.120]   of where it needs to be, both cosmetically and for health.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   So that's a conversation between you and your doctor
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.060]   and you and you, frankly,
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.260]   but you want to avoid being insulin resistant
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:28.800]   because being insulin resistant and being obese
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.560]   can indeed lead to hair loss.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.920]   And there are many people out there who are not obese,
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.180]   who nonetheless are experiencing hair thinning and hair loss
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.120]   because they are insulin resistant
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.720]   by way of reduced IGF-1 activity.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.960]   There are a few supplements,
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.240]   so these are over-the-counter supplements,
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.660]   such as myo-inositol,
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:48.120]   taken at dosages of about 900 milligrams before sleep,
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.560]   which by the way can also assist in sleep,
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.920]   or things like berberine or metformin,
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.160]   which are known to improve insulin sensitivity.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.800]   Each and every one of these has its own profile
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.960]   of positive and negative effects.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.060]   The lowest number of side effects
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.680]   is associated with 900 milligram myo-inositol
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.280]   taken about 30 minutes before sleep,
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.840]   mostly because it can make people a little bit drowsy,
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.680]   and it does aid sleep in some really great ways,
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.440]   but really exercise and maintaining
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.160]   a healthy nutritional program are also going to be key.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.840]   You just can't discard those.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.160]   Berberine, which is a substance made from tree bark,
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   is sometimes called the poor man's metformin,
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.360]   metformin being the equally effective
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.280]   prescription version of berberine.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.900]   More put differently, berberine is the non-prescription,
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.740]   but equally effective version of metformin.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:37.440]   Keep in mind that both berberine and metformin
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.580]   dramatically reduce blood sugar levels,
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.440]   and so if you're not going to take them with carbohydrates,
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440]   it can lead to some feelings of discomfort.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.800]   That's why I'm not a fan of them,
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.100]   but if your goal is to really improve insulin sensitivity,
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.620]   they are considered very potent tools
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:52.320]   on the list of things that can do that.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.620]   The other thing that's really important
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.900]   for maintaining proper hair growth, this antigen phase,
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.100]   is that you need sufficient iron.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:02.200]   This is because iron and ferritin play a key role
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.780]   in the cell growth pathways that go from the stem cells
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:08.820]   to the stimulation of keratin within the hair itself.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:11.400]   Don't have time to go into this pathway in a lot of detail,
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.380]   but you can have your blood levels of iron measured.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.780]   This turns out to be pretty important
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.800]   because you don't just want to start
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.680]   popping iron supplements because too much iron can be toxic,
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.800]   too little, means you're anemic.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.080]   For women, the levels of iron that you want
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.320]   are somewhere between 25 and 100,
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.180]   and for men, somewhere between 30 and 150.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.840]   Fortunately, the tests or the blood tests for iron
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.920]   are usually a very inexpensive add
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.320]   to your current blood panel.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.120]   So if you're going in for a blood panel for LDL, HDL,
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:40.940]   kind of typical things,
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.880]   or if you're doing the more elaborate hormone testing,
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.760]   which I do recommend people do if they can afford it
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.280]   or if their insurance covers it,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.880]   do ask for an iron test as well.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.780]   And if your iron is low,
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:51.460]   you may need to supplement your iron.
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.640]   If your iron is too high, that's not good either.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.040]   But iron plays a key role in the antigen phase
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:57.880]   of hair growth.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.360]   So you want to make sure you at least have sufficient iron.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.520]   And if you don't, you want to make sure
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.800]   that you're getting it from nutrition
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.440]   and/or supplementation.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.360]   Okay, so earlier we were talking about dihydrotestosterone.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.040]   Dihydrotestosterone, just to jog your memory,
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.220]   is a form of testosterone that can bind the androgen receptor
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.440]   at five times the affinity of regular testosterone.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.280]   Both men and women have a lot of testosterone
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.520]   relative to estrogen.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.000]   It just so happens that men tend to have more testosterone
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.760]   than women do overall.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.780]   But both men and women, as they age,
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.420]   convert more of the testosterone they have
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.000]   to dihydrotestosterone.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.620]   And dihydrotestosterone does two things
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.980]   that are bad for hair maintenance and hair growth.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.860]   First of all, it shortens the antigen phase,
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.040]   that growth phase.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.380]   So whatever hair is going to grow
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.340]   is going to occur over a shorter period of time.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.260]   Second of all, because of the presence of androgen receptors
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.780]   on the stem cell niche area and around it,
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.080]   it actually miniaturizes the follicle
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.700]   and the stem cell niche.
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.700]   In other words, it makes the population of cells
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.940]   that give rise to more hair protein smaller
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.980]   and can eliminate it altogether.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:08.200]   And that is why anything that reduces 5-alpha reductase
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.460]   is going to reduce DHT, is going to maintain
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.660]   or extend the growth phase,
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.340]   the antigen phase of hair growth,
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.640]   and is going to offset or prevent
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.740]   some of the telogen phase,
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:23.460]   the pinching off and the removal of that stem cell niche.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.780]   Now, one substance that we know
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.600]   can inhibit 5-alpha reductase,
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.980]   although it does it pretty weakly, is solpalmetto,
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.740]   which is an extract of the solpalmetto berry.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.180]   To be honest, I don't know how this was initially discovered.
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:37.540]   If anyone knows, please put it in the show note captions.
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.040]   When I looked online, I found a bunch of conflicting stories
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.900]   about who was the first person
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:46.200]   to start extracting the extract of the solpalmetto berries.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.500]   So I have no idea which one of those is true.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.460]   Maybe somebody can tell me.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.300]   The good thing about solpalmetto treatment
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:55.860]   is that it is known to have very few, if any, side effects.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.300]   There might be some side effects in about 1% of people,
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.700]   but it's not associated with a lot of side effects.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.500]   It's also known that when taken
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.880]   at about 300 milligrams per day,
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.340]   and here it doesn't have to be that strict.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.420]   Most of the studies that I explored
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.680]   involve taking anywhere from 200 to 500 milligrams
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.720]   of solpalmetto, but most of them focused
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.480]   on about 300 milligrams of solpalmetto per day,
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.200]   divided into two or three doses.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.040]   Why?
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.440]   Well, it has a relatively short half-life,
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.120]   meaning it's going to get cleared from the bloodstream,
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.980]   and more importantly, its biological action
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:27.500]   is going to be very short-lived.
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:31.320]   So if you can get ahold of 50 or 100 milligram capsules
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.200]   or tablets of solpalmetto and divide those up,
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.540]   taking them in the morning, afternoon, and evening,
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:37.940]   or even just in the morning and evening
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:41.300]   to achieve a total of about 300 milligrams per day,
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.680]   that's going to very likely help you hold on
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.620]   to some of the hair that you would have otherwise lost,
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.400]   maybe even grow some new hair.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.780]   And I say maybe give you some new hair growth
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:53.560]   because solpalmetto is not known
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.220]   to be a particularly robust treatment
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.620]   for the reversal of hair loss.
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.280]   It's known to have some effect,
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.140]   but it's generally taken in conjunction
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.120]   with a bunch of other things.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.660]   And so it's really hard to tease out
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.860]   just what amount of hair growth
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.700]   or prevention of hair loss
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.860]   is due to solpalmetto specifically.
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:13.380]   But I mention it here because the mechanism of action
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.300]   is logical and fairly well-known,
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.100]   which is this weak effect in reducing 5-alpha reductase
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.020]   and thereby reducing DHT.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.740]   So again, because it has relatively low side effects,
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.620]   even though it's not super effective,
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.040]   and because it's fairly low cost
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.580]   and it's available over the counter,
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:32.040]   I felt it was important to include.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.660]   Now, as soon as people hear things like solpalmetto berry,
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.860]   they're probably also thinking,
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.900]   "Oh boy, here come all the herbals."
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.320]   Now, keep in mind that there are some herbal compounds
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.940]   that have pretty robust biological effects.
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:43.780]   And we talked before
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.540]   in our optimizing testosterone episodes
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.620]   about things like Tonga Ali and Fidogia agrestis,
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.700]   which taken in correct dosages and in the correct way
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.260]   can be pretty potent for increasing luteinizing hormone
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.780]   and free testosterone.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:57.980]   Not going to have huge effects.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.020]   It's not like taking exogenous anabolic steroids,
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.840]   but they can have real effects.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.660]   And so herbal compounds can be potent.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.540]   However, I do acknowledge that there's a vast market
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:10.680]   out there of herbal compounds and plant-based compounds
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.200]   that people are arguing,
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.420]   mostly the people who sell them are arguing,
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.740]   can increase hair growth.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.300]   And there are some decent studies of these things.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.460]   The hard part about studying these herbal compounds
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:24.180]   and these plant-derived compounds for increasing hair growth
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.440]   is that they are often taken in combination
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.460]   with one another.
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.620]   In fact, most of the hair growth supplements
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.560]   that involve these herbal compounds and plant compounds
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.340]   include five or 10, sometimes even more things altogether.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.080]   So teasing out which ones are effective
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.800]   and which dosages are effective is nearly impossible.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.280]   They're just too many variables.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.380]   So you will hear, for instance, that green tea extract,
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:50.580]   Reisi mushroom, pumpkin oil, zinc, curcumin,
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.980]   that all of these things can increase hair growth.
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:56.500]   Perhaps the only thing on that list that makes logical sense
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.360]   with respect to the biochemistry is that curcumin
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:03.060]   is known to in some people be a potent inhibitor,
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.940]   a five alpha reductase and DHT.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.320]   So much so that I can personally say for me,
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.540]   I once took curcumin, turmeric, it's also called,
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.700]   in high dosage.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.860]   This is about a gram to two gram capsules.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:17.020]   And I felt absolutely terrible.
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.280]   I mean, just dreadful.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.700]   I don't care if it allowed me to keep my hair forever.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.740]   I would rather lose all my hair three times over.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.380]   Well, I guess that means it would have grown back.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:28.720]   I'd rather lose all my hair, let's just put it that way,
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.860]   than ever take curcumin or turmeric in high dosages again.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.620]   And in saying that, I know that many people
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.020]   take turmeric and curcumin
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:37.660]   and really like its anti-inflammatory properties
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.500]   and don't experience any side effects.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:42.220]   I just happen to be particularly sensitive to curcumin
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.060]   by way of this DHT pathway.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.340]   And I know this by way of blood work.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:47.400]   So I'm never going near that stuff again.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.660]   That said, a lot of these herbal compounds and cocktails
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:56.660]   probably will have some minor marginal infinitesimally small,
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:00.240]   somewhere in that range effect on maintaining hair growth
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.940]   or in stimulating new hair growth.
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.900]   It's just that there really aren't clinical studies
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.060]   to support any one of them.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.980]   And that's why I singled out Saul Palmetto
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.380]   as one of the few for which the biochemical pathway
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.360]   of inhibiting foul for reductase
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.440]   and the low incidence of side effects
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.220]   and the fact that many people have used it
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:19.640]   with some degree of success makes it a standalone,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.380]   I wouldn't say recommendation, but a consideration.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:25.880]   Another commonly discussed and used commercial compound
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.280]   for offsetting hair loss and stimulating hair growth
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.140]   is ketoconazole.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.220]   Sometimes this is known as nizoral,
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:35.380]   where nizoral is the brand name of a shampoo.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:38.920]   Ketoconazole is an antifungal that was initially developed
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.140]   to treat dandruff and severe psoriasis.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.180]   So ketoconazole has been shown to be effective
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.840]   in increasing hair number.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.360]   It's also been shown to be effective
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.720]   in increasing hair diameter, which is somewhat surprising
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.480]   because one of the common side effects of ketoconazole
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.560]   is drying, shinning and brittle hair.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.520]   So what's going on there is a little unclear.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.240]   We'll return to that in a moment.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.240]   The mechanism of action for ketoconazole
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.320]   is pretty interesting.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.600]   Remember earlier we were talking about the sebaceous gland
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.340]   and the production of sebum, that oily stuff,
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.260]   whose very name seems to evoke disgust in certain people.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.620]   Well, ketoconazole can disrupt some of the fungal growth
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.700]   that frankly we all have on our scalp all the time.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.340]   I know this is a surprise to many of you,
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.060]   but you are constantly bombarded with viruses,
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.740]   bacteria and funguses all the time,
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:29.020]   but we managed to battle those off with our immune system
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.520]   either by physical barriers, such as an oil barrier,
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.160]   like the sebum or through antimicrobial action.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.560]   So chemical approaches, our immune system,
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:38.980]   the sebum, et cetera.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.760]   Ketoconazole acts as an antifungal that in some way
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.460]   seems to reinforce the properties of sebum
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:48.000]   at keeping out other fungal infections.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.920]   And the net effect, at least as far as we know,
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:53.380]   is a mild reduction in DHT.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.000]   Now exactly how this happens isn't really clear.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.660]   What is clear is that the use of ketoconazole shampoos
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.460]   two to four times per week with a scalp contact time
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.920]   of about three to five minutes has been shown
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.000]   to give about an 80% response rate of maintaining hair
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.400]   that would otherwise be lost.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.480]   So that's pretty dramatic, 80%.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.060]   What is less clear is whether or not ketoconazole shampoo
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.600]   can actually stimulate new hair growth.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.560]   But as you're probably starting to realize,
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.940]   this is always a bit of a tough thing to disentangle.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.300]   Maintenance of hair that you would have lost
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.740]   versus new hair growth.
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.060]   Certainly that's an easy thing to disambiguate
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.440]   if you have a patch of scalp
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.460]   where there is absolutely no hair.
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:36.900]   These so-called dead zones that you can resurrect
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:38.260]   with certain treatments.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:41.220]   But what about areas of your scalp where hair is thinning?
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.420]   So for instance, on the top of your head,
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:45.540]   this is where many women will first experience
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.780]   pattern hair loss.
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:50.480]   Alopecia is right at their midline.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.840]   Especially if they have a part right there,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.780]   they'll start to notice that under very bright light
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.060]   fluorescent lights in particular,
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.600]   they'll notice that thinning of their hair there
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.080]   or in the forehead region.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.980]   They'll start using ketoconazole shampoo.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.940]   Again, the typical recommendation
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.300]   is two to four times per week
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.360]   with a scalp contact time of three to five minutes
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.500]   and really rubbing it in and then rinsing it out.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.800]   You don't need to be super vigorous,
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.100]   but you want to make sure that it gets down into the follicle
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.580]   and around the follicles,
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.580]   not just sitting on top of the hair,
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.480]   which is going to be especially important
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.640]   for people who have long hair to really massage it in.
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.020]   Well, they will experience a growth of hair
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.580]   in that particular region that almost certainly
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.060]   were due to miniaturization of the hair follicle
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.960]   and reduction of the total population of stem cells
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.040]   in that follicle,
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.200]   as opposed to complete loss of the stem cell population.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.960]   The reason we say this is that there's no reason to think
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.740]   that ketoconazole can actually stimulate IGF-1
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.800]   or activate growth itself.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.360]   It's probably offsetting some of the reductions
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.740]   in the antigen phase and some of the exacerbation
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.040]   of the telogen phase.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.800]   Now, if you decide to use ketoconazole
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.300]   as an approach to offsetting hair loss,
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.900]   it's very important that you get a hold of a shampoo
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:59.540]   that's at least 2% concentration of ketoconazole.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.460]   This is important because a lot of the ones
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:04.000]   that are available out there, especially online,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.980]   are going to be 1% or lower.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:08.140]   So you want to try and obtain a ketoconazole shampoo
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:12.000]   of 2% or higher concentration of ketoconazole
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.200]   'cause it has other things in it, of course.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.620]   I should mention that there are occasional side effects
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.640]   with ketoconazole.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.920]   The rates of side effects from the meta-analyses
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:23.360]   and reviews that I read were somewhere between 1% and 8%
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.020]   of people will experience some side effects,
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.440]   but those side effects tend to be pretty mild.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.600]   Things like irritation of the scalp,
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.480]   things like thinning and brittleness of the hair
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.720]   that sometimes can be offset by using shampoos
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.240]   that contain things like biotin.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.320]   I know many people are probably curious about biotin,
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.200]   which is a protein that can be incorporated
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.380]   into the keratin.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:45.320]   Whether or not different biotin-enriched shampoos
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.000]   can really enhance the total amount of biotin
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.780]   that gets incorporated into the hair
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.520]   isn't clear, but it is clear
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.200]   that having sufficient biotin around is important.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.660]   So if you get a little bit extra from your shampoo,
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:58.120]   you can imagine how that would, quote unquote,
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.560]   tap off the amount of biotin in that hair.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.100]   And there are people out there saying that biotin-enriched
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.880]   shampoos have done wonders for them, who knows?
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.360]   I'm not going to dispute their experience.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.520]   So if you're going to use ketoconazole,
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.700]   keep in mind that the more typical brand names
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:15.760]   that are out there, you know which ones they are,
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:18.400]   oftentimes don't have 2%.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.480]   Or if they do have 2%, they can be very drying
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.880]   and lead to brittle hair.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.760]   There are newer and now fortunately a greater variety
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.960]   of ketoconazole-containing shampoos.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:32.800]   We as a podcast and I don't have any affiliation
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.080]   to any of these, but I will provide a links
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.580]   to a couple of the more prominent ones
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:40.280]   that are known to have 2% concentration of ketoconazole,
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.620]   as well as some other things in them
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.800]   known to offset some of that dryness and brittleness
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.940]   that ketoconazole shampoos can trigger.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.640]   So by now I think it will be abundantly clear
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:54.000]   why inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and thereby reducing DHT
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.320]   should increase hair growth because of the negative impact
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.040]   that DHT has on the hair follicle.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.400]   The major player in this whole story
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.120]   around inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and reducing DHT
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.980]   to maintain or increase hair growth
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.800]   is going to be finasteride
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.200]   and its close cousin, dutasteride.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.640]   Finasteride is effective in reducing DHT
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   because of its actions in reducing the type II isoenzyme
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.480]   or isoform of 5-alpha reductase.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.500]   It turns out there's three different isoforms
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:28.280]   or what are sometimes called isoenzymes
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.760]   of 5-alpha reductase.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.000]   This is getting pretty far down in the weeds.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.520]   What I think most of you just need to know
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.220]   is that finasteride reduces DHT.
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.640]   That's the net product of finasteride.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.660]   And in doing so, it can increase hair count
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.320]   by as much as 20%.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320]   Pretty remarkable if you think about it.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.880]   In addition, finasteride treatment done properly,
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.020]   which we'll define in a moment,
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.320]   can reduce hair loss in 90% of all people that take it.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.500]   That is, I mean, near staggering.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.160]   I mean, there aren't many pharmaceuticals out there
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.600]   that have that kind of efficacy, really dramatic.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.280]   And in addition, it's known to increase hair thickness
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.660]   by about 20 to 30% overall.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.600]   So not just create new growth of hairs and thicker hairs,
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.580]   but whatever hair you do happen to have on your head,
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.480]   it can further thicken those.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.480]   So the finasteride story is one,
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.440]   I think, of general success.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.840]   I mean, it really seems to improve hair growth
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.620]   and help you hold on to the hair that you have.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.680]   The issue with finasteride is twofold.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.640]   First of all, it is known to have
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.320]   some pretty significant side effects
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.000]   if it's not dosed properly
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.280]   and in particular populations of people.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.480]   And this is because there is a wide variation
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:42.120]   in the amount of the different isoenzymes that people make.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.340]   This is why I brought up the isoenzymes earlier.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.600]   Some people make more of isoenzyme one and three.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.240]   Some people make more of isoenzyme two and three
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.400]   and every variation thereof.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.540]   So when people take finasteride,
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.940]   some people are very strong responders
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:00.500]   and they achieve really effective hair regrowth
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.800]   and maintenance of hair.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.240]   Other people, less effective,
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.280]   although still pretty impressive,
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.080]   but the catalog of side effects that people experience
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.000]   at a given dose varies widely.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.320]   So there's a lot of trial and error that has to take place.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.640]   I also should point out that finasteride
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.120]   comes in two major forms.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.000]   There's an oral form and there's a topical form.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   So this is not unlike our discussion of minoxidil earlier.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.580]   Topical finasteride is typically taken in 1% solution
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.520]   or ointment and rubbed into the head.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.840]   Sometimes it's now also incorporated into shampoos,
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.720]   but typically it's put into a solution
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.360]   that people rub into their head.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.740]   And it is thought that the 1% solutions are equivalent
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.040]   to one milligram of systemic finasteride.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.520]   Now we need to take a step back and ask
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.720]   why was finasteride developed in the first place?
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.000]   Well, finasteride as a fairly potent
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.880]   5-alpha reductase inhibitor, it's great at lowering DHT.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.840]   It was developed for treatment of prostate enlargement
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.640]   and various issues of the prostate
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.560]   that are associated with elevated DHT that occurs with age.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.400]   The topical finasterides were designed with the hope
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.580]   that the finasteride would make it into the hair follicle
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.600]   and would inhibit DHT there
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.000]   and allow for more growth of the hair,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.060]   which apparently it does,
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.140]   but not make it into the systemic circulation,
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.120]   or at least not at concentration sufficient enough
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.280]   to cause as many side effects as with the oral dosing.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.400]   Now, the problem is it does make it
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.880]   into systemic circulation.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.440]   The issue is also that topical application of finasteride
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.000]   is harder to dose than oral finasteride.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.600]   I'm not saying you should be taking oral
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.460]   rather than topical finasteride,
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:37.400]   but keep in mind that the dosages of finasteride
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.720]   that have been shown to be effective
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:41.640]   for inducing hair growth cover an enormous range.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.120]   So as low as 0.01 milligrams per day
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.860]   and as high as five milligrams per day,
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:51.120]   which is a just staggering range.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.860]   Now, when trying to simplify the problem
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:54.680]   of how much finasteride to take,
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:59.080]   either by way of oral tablet or by way of topical solution,
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.120]   we can get a bit of leverage on this
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.280]   by thinking about how much DHT reduction occurs
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.620]   as a function of dose.
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:08.800]   And there, finasteride shows us this really interesting,
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.360]   what's called logarithmic distribution.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.720]   What it means is that for a dosage
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.000]   of 0.01 milligrams of finasteride,
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.200]   you're going to achieve approximately 50% reduction in DHT,
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.680]   and that's systemic DHT.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.880]   So this is a blood draw measuring your DHT,
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:28.320]   then taking 0.01 milligrams of finasteride,
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.360]   again, 0.01, very low dose of finasteride,
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.720]   or appeared a couple of weeks,
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.840]   measure people's DHT in their blood again,
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.660]   and you see that it's reduced by 50%.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:43.620]   However, at increasing dosages of 0.2 milligrams,
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:48.620]   one milligrams, five milligrams of oral finasteride per day
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.760]   over the same period of time, the increase,
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.740]   or I should say the reduction in dihydrotestosterone
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:57.180]   doesn't increase linearly.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.400]   It's not that you go from 50% to 60% to 75% to 100%
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.800]   with each increasing dose, it tapers off,
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.900]   it kind of flattens out.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.100]   It tends to increase a little bit,
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:09.360]   but it's sort of a gradual slope increasing
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.880]   as you head from 0.2 milligrams out to five milligrams.
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.380]   So what this means is that given that reducing DHT
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.300]   can cause various side effects, sexual side effects,
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:24.540]   reductions in either sexual function or sexual drive,
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.940]   as well as overall drive and motivation,
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:29.380]   sometimes even some depressive symptoms,
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:33.860]   that everything points to taking the lowest effective dose
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.540]   of finasteride and starting with a very low dose
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.740]   of finasteride because low doses of finasteride,
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:44.180]   even at that 0.01 milligrams taken orally daily,
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.240]   are already leading to a 50% reduction
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.780]   in dihydrotestosterone and thereby taken
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.540]   for a long enough period of time should offset hair loss
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:54.220]   and stimulate hair growth.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.540]   One of the problems, however,
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:58.460]   is that people will start taking finasteride at a low dose,
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:02.900]   0.1 milligrams or 0.2 milligrams, maybe even 0.01 milligrams
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:06.180]   and there will be a reduction in their DHT,
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:09.780]   but because of the long duration of that antigen phase,
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.100]   they don't see a lot of change in hair growth
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:14.380]   in the first month or even two months.
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:16.900]   And so what they end up doing is increasing their dosage
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.260]   and then they start to see hair growth,
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.380]   but then they start to experience more side effects.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:23.140]   Now, the side effects of oral finasteride
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:25.620]   are serious enough and common enough in people
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.960]   that take finasteride that the topical solutions
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.980]   were developed, but there too, one needs to exercise caution
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.040]   because if we are going to translate
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.140]   between topical finasteride and oral finasteride
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.140]   with the understanding that topical finasteride
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:40.880]   can actually make it into the systemic circulation,
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:43.380]   we need to look at what's been shown in clinical studies,
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:46.460]   which is that, for instance, taking one milliliter
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.180]   of 0.25% finasteride applied to the scalp,
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:51.780]   this is a very typical recommendation,
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:55.240]   translates to the same thing that would be achieved
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.740]   with 2.5 milligrams of oral finasteride.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.340]   And when I say translates to the same thing,
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.740]   what I mean is it leads to the same concentrations
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:05.140]   in the blood.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:08.740]   Now, consider that 0.2 milligrams,
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.820]   0.2 milligrams of finasteride in the blood
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.020]   is known to be effective in generating new hair growth
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.360]   and maintaining hair that one already has
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.860]   when they start the treatment.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:22.700]   So if you think that the topical finasterides are actually
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.360]   creating lower overall systemic concentrations
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.200]   of finasteride, that is not necessarily the case.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.940]   Again, one milliliter of topical finasteride at 0.25%
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.240]   leads to a 2.5 milligram concentration in the blood
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.140]   when the effective dose within the bloodstream
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:44.420]   by taking it orally as a pill is 0.2 milligrams.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.720]   That might not seem like a big deal to you,
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:47.900]   although it is a big deal, right?
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:51.180]   We're talking 2.5 milligrams versus 0.2,
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.440]   but it is a huge deal when you consider
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.420]   that the side effects of finasteride increase
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.540]   as you increase the concentration of finasteride
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:46:59.980]   in the bloodstream.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.580]   So where does this leave us?
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.420]   Should people who are interested in taking finasteride
[01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:08.140]   take the oral form at low dose or take the topical form
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.500]   and simply try and apply it less often
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.420]   or guess at what their systemic concentration
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.640]   of finasteride is?
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.400]   Well, it's going to vary from person to person.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.660]   Some people are very sensitive to finasteride
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.960]   and not in the good sense.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.100]   The side effects just really show up quickly
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.260]   and they tend to be dramatic.
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:24.160]   Other people, not so much.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.920]   The dosage recommendations that I was able to arrive at
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.480]   based on the clinical studies and frankly,
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.260]   in discussion with some doctors who prescribe finasteride
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.540]   were the following.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:38.860]   0.5 milligrams to one milligram of finasteride
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.820]   as a tablet per day seems to be an effective
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:46.060]   and pretty safe starting place for most people.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.420]   Now, some people will find that even that 0.5 milligram
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.120]   dosage is just going to cause side effects
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.220]   that are not going to work for them.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.780]   And they're going to either have to reduce their dosage
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:57.220]   of finasteride or move to the topical
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.700]   or maybe cease taking finasteride altogether.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.420]   But for many people out there,
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:03.940]   that's going to be pretty well tolerated.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.460]   The key thing here is that one is going to have to wait
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:07.700]   some period of time to see
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.540]   whether or not any hair growth occurs.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:12.540]   It is a naive and frankly, foolish approach
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:14.380]   based on what we know about the duration
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.300]   of that antigen phase of the hair
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.180]   to do one of these treatments, wait a week or two
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.820]   and then decide to up your dose.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.940]   Now, it is not foolish to reduce your dose
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.400]   if you're experiencing bad side effects,
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.980]   but to simply increase your dose
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:29.240]   because you're not getting results quickly enough,
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:30.740]   that's not going to be the best approach.
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.940]   I really encourage people who are going to explore
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.420]   the finasteride route to think of this as a long-term
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.740]   project and to really ratchet up slowly, if at all,
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.220]   starting initially with a low dose
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.380]   taken for a long period of time,
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.940]   maybe even as long as 25 weeks
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.020]   before considering going up any further.
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:47.320]   Certainly, as I mentioned before,
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.340]   if you need to go down further,
[01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:51.140]   that's not going to be a problem,
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.860]   at least not in terms of reducing side effects.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.300]   I mean, you're not going to get additional hair growth,
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.900]   but you're certainly not going to increase your side effects
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.960]   if you reduce your dose.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.480]   However, I will talk a little bit later
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:02.220]   about post-finasteride syndrome,
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:03.060]   which is something that's getting
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.620]   increasing attention nowadays.
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:05.620]   That's something that occurs
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.220]   after people have taken finasteride
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.940]   for an extended period of time.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.500]   Now, some of you have perhaps heard,
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:11.860]   and I'll just tell you right here,
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.280]   that the topical forms of finasteride
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.260]   are associated with far less side effects.
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:18.820]   Now, that might come as surprising
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:21.340]   given that topical application of finasteride
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.020]   can lead to systemic distribution of finasteride,
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.180]   but the numbers that are out there right now
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.340]   are that topical finasteride is associated
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.260]   with 30 to 50% fewer side effects
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.280]   or 30 to 50% less severe side effects
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.840]   than oral finasteride.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.040]   Now, there are several things
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.380]   probably responsible for that.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:40.000]   One is that people tend to ratchet up
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.180]   their dose of oral finasteride pretty quickly,
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.820]   but keep in mind that the effective dose of finasteride
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.840]   in the blood is 0.2 milligrams.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.440]   Now, earlier I said the typical topical finasteride
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.780]   solutions are 0.25%.
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:53.880]   People are taking one mil of it.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.940]   That equates to 2.5 milligrams,
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:58.360]   and so it seems like a massive overdosing.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.280]   Ah, but here's the discrepancy,
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.240]   and here's where we can arrive
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.480]   at some reasonable recommendations.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:06.880]   If you decide that finasteride's right for you,
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.560]   you get a prescription,
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.740]   I would hope that you're monitoring your DHT levels
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:11.840]   and other hormone levels.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:14.620]   That would be ideal in working with a doctor, please.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:19.080]   0.5 milligrams to one milligram per day
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:22.700]   of oral finasteride seems to be the best starting place.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:26.520]   For topical finasteride,
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.020]   it's going to be that one milliliter of 0.25%
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.240]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:34.460]   but that's taken only one time per week.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.680]   And you can fully expect that right after the application,
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.960]   you will have higher levels of finasteride
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.680]   in your bloodstream and therefore lower levels of DHT,
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.480]   and that that will alter across the week.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:47.100]   Most people are not going to be able to measure their DHT
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.000]   on a day-by-day or even weekly basis.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.760]   It's just too expensive and labor intensive,
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.000]   but I think those dosing regimens ought to get people
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.800]   into more or less the same category
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.860]   of optimizing hair maintenance and hair growth
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.280]   while minimizing finasteride side effects.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.400]   One point about finasteride taken either alone
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:07.600]   or in combination is that in recent years,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.100]   really in the last five or so years,
[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:12.040]   there's been increasing discussion
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.200]   about so-called post-finasteride syndrome.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.940]   Now, post-finasteride syndrome is indeed a new phenomenon
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:21.500]   in the sense that finasteride has been prescribed
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.700]   for a very long period of time
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:25.080]   for treatment of the prostate
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.440]   at dosages of about five milligrams per day, right?
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.160]   That's a very high dose, sometimes lower,
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.600]   but as high as five milligrams per day.
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.800]   And for many years, there was no discussion
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.640]   about this post-finasteride syndrome.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.160]   What is post-finasteride syndrome?
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:42.760]   Post-finasteride syndrome is when typically it's males,
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.360]   this is where it's been described,
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:47.680]   will take finasteride at any range of dosages
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.280]   from one milligram to five milligrams per day.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.160]   They're either doing this for prostate
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.520]   or more likely they're doing it to offset hair loss
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.160]   and increase hair growth.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.700]   And then they stop taking finasteride for whatever reason,
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.400]   financial, or it wasn't working for them,
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.360]   or the side effects were not to their liking.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.240]   And they start to experience some very severe,
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:09.160]   what can only be called syndrome effects,
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.200]   such as very reduced libido,
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.240]   very reduced erectile function,
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.960]   very reduced mood to the point of depression,
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.600]   even suicidal depression.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.120]   So this is pretty scary stuff,
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.260]   especially since it's occurring at an age
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.380]   when most of these things
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.300]   are not typically occurring in males.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:29.020]   They can occur, but they're not typical of younger males
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.500]   in their 20s and 30s and early 40s.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.240]   So we have to ask ourselves, what's going on here?
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:36.120]   After all, people have taken finasteride for the prostate
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:37.140]   at fairly high dosages
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:40.040]   without this post-finasteride syndrome when they've stopped.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.120]   Now these young males are taking finasteride,
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.080]   they're coming off finasteride,
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.880]   and they're getting this very severe,
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:47.320]   very debilitating post-finasteride syndrome.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.200]   This has become a kind of hot topic,
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.800]   enough so that medical doctors
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.320]   who have been prescribing finasteride for a very long time
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:54.820]   have been forced to address this.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.940]   I think at first they were sort of perplexed and thought,
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:58.680]   I don't know, this might be psychosomatic,
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:52:59.520]   whatever that means.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.560]   I mean, as a neuroscientist
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.740]   who works on mind-body connection,
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:04.260]   we know that nothing is truly psychosomatic.
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.580]   Everything is of the mind and body.
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:09.100]   But the point is that enough medical attention
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.980]   has been placed on post-finasteride syndrome
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:14.120]   and trying to unravel exactly what that is,
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:17.160]   where there are now a few general conclusions
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.440]   about what might be going on.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.580]   First of all, it seems that younger males taking finasteride,
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:25.440]   in particular at high dosages to improve hair growth
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.780]   or offset hair loss, seems to be one of the key variables.
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:31.460]   We're not seeing this post-finasteride syndrome
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.960]   as much in older males.
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.480]   In fact, it seems to occur more in males in their 20s
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:39.200]   and 30s than males in their 40s and older.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.040]   So that's one thing.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.040]   And it may relate to the ways in which dihydrotestosterone
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.180]   we know has a very key role in early embryonic development.
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:50.120]   It's actually what's responsible for the male genitalia.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.800]   It's also responsible for certain things
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.120]   in female development, but mainly in utero,
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.960]   it's responsible for male development
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.560]   and development of the penis in particular.
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.520]   And then around the time of puberty, dihydrotestosterone
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:05.540]   acts again in what's called its activating effects
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:08.640]   to further increase growth of the genitalia,
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:11.080]   increase the musculature, bone growth, et cetera,
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.200]   and increase libido and a number of other things.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.020]   It's probably also involved in the activation of puberty.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:18.420]   It's certainly not the only hormone involved
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.740]   in the activation of male puberty,
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.580]   but it's certainly one of the key players.
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.620]   So dihydrotestosterone has these known early roles
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.580]   in embryonic development and in puberty.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.220]   But what post-phenasteride syndrome seems to indicate
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:34.220]   is that dihydrotestosterone is likely having further effects
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.980]   on male maturation, in particular maturation
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:39.200]   of the hypothalamus and areas of the brain
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.740]   that continue well into one's 20s
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.300]   and maybe even one's 30s.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:45.660]   And here, I just want everyone to keep in mind
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:49.780]   that we tend to think about development as childhood,
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:52.720]   teenage years, young adulthood, adulthood,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:54.360]   but really development never stops.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.500]   Development is something that starts at conception
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:59.500]   and birth, of course, and then extends all the way out
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:00.500]   until the point when we die.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.780]   So even if we live to be in our late 90s
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.500]   or achieve 100 years of age,
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.700]   development is occurring that entire time
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:09.260]   and these different hormones such as dihydrotestosterone
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:12.580]   are having different impact across the lifespan
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:15.080]   and in different ways across the lifespan.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.860]   So there isn't a clear conclusion
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.880]   about what post-phenasteride syndrome is really all about,
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:23.100]   but it points to the fact that DHT is likely to be involved
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:27.700]   in development of the brain and the brain to genital axis,
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:30.300]   because I mentioned that because so many of the side effects
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:32.340]   that are associated with this post-phenasteride syndrome
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:34.860]   seem to center on sexual side effects,
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:36.580]   although they're also the depressive side effects.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:38.440]   Of course, those can be related to one another
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:39.660]   in either direction.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:42.540]   So while I do understand that loss of one's hair
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.480]   or potential loss of one's hair
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.520]   can be particularly troubling and anxiety provoking,
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.740]   even cause depression in some cases, I am sensitive to that.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.580]   You also want to be sensitive to the fact
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:54.960]   that some of these treatments such as finasteride
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.780]   can carry very serious side effects,
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.940]   even if you come off them, AKA post-phenasteride syndrome.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:02.620]   As long as we're talking about finasteride
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:05.580]   and this general pathway of 5-alpha reductase inhibition
[01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:08.320]   and thereby DHT inhibition and on and on,
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:11.340]   topics and themes and nomenclature you are now
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:15.040]   very familiar with, we have to talk about dutasteride.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.780]   Dutasteride is yet another molecule similar to finasteride,
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.620]   but remember those three isoforms
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.860]   of the 5-alpha reductase enzyme?
[01:56:23.860 --> 01:56:27.460]   Well, it inhibits all three, mainly type one and type two,
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:31.000]   but also type three, and it does it very potently.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.700]   So as a consequence, the typical dosage of oral dutasteride,
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:40.240]   get this, 0.5 milligrams to 2.5 milligrams taken orally,
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.900]   works two to five times faster than typical finasteride
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:49.900]   at inducing hair regrowth and reduces DHT by, get this,
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.320]   95%, so it just near flatlines DHT.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:58.800]   And that can occur at concentrations as low as 0.5 milligrams,
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.400]   although you will see prescriptions
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.940]   and people taking dutasteride anywhere from 0.5 milligrams
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.360]   all the way to 2.5 milligrams orally.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.900]   Now, not surprisingly, dutasteride is associated
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:12.240]   with a lot of side effects related to the DHT pathway.
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.360]   So things like reduction in sex drive,
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:17.480]   reduction in overall drive.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.940]   It also tends to impact other hormone pathways,
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:21.760]   so increases in estrogen prolactin.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.520]   That's why gynecomastia,
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:25.660]   growth of male breast tissue sometimes occurs
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.240]   when people take dutasteride.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.580]   And so you're probably asking,
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:30.280]   why would anyone take dutasteride?
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.500]   Why not just take finasteride and wait for that hair growth?
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:37.160]   Well, the answer is that people are often very impatient
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:39.160]   and it turns out that dutasteride
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:42.520]   works about two to five times faster than finasteride.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.520]   So some people don't want to wait a full 30 weeks
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.520]   or 40 weeks or 50 weeks or more
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.020]   in order to grow their hair back.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.520]   And they're very concerned about the hair loss
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.360]   that's occurring.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.620]   So they will take what I hope would be a very low dose
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.680]   of dutasteride.
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:59.100]   I realize that there are ways to take dutasteride
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.320]   that can be safer, offset some of these side effects,
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:04.740]   but by my read of the literature,
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.380]   if one is going to try to mildly inhibit the DHT pathway,
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:12.020]   things like salt palmetto, things like topical caffeine,
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.160]   which has some effect on the androgen pathway,
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.140]   but as we talked about earlier, tickles other pathways,
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:19.100]   things like ketoconazole,
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.400]   mild reduction in androgen receptor pathways in the follicle
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.580]   and very direct because it's applied directly to the scalp.
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.460]   Things like that are going to be the best route
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.840]   for mild reductions in DHT
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:31.620]   as an attempt to maintain hair or grow hair.
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:33.900]   Whereas if one really wants a potent stimulus
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:36.020]   for increasing hair growth,
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:38.760]   that's very likely going to be finasteride
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.680]   and hopefully low enough dosages of finasteride
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.120]   and hopefully a patient enough, patient, person,
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.220]   that they are willing to wait the duration of time
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.500]   required for that hair growth to come back
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.640]   because they understand that that androgen phase
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:53.740]   takes some time.
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.520]   Now, the holy grail of all this hair stuff
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.540]   is in understanding that no one specific treatment is magic.
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:02.640]   And in fact, there are now a number of good meta-analyses
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:05.500]   comparing the various treatments we've talked about today
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:06.880]   alone or in combination.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.720]   And we can summarize that pretty easily
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:11.380]   by saying that combination treatments
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:14.100]   that involve a mechanical stimulus
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.760]   and a chemical stimulus
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.160]   are always going to be better than either one alone.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.940]   And within the mechanical category,
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:23.460]   the stimulus that seems to work best is microneedling.
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.420]   So the combination of microneedling and finasteride
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:29.840]   can lead to some pretty robust and impressive hair regrowth.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.740]   So much so that people that were,
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:34.840]   I guess we'd only describe them as pretty bald or bald,
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.100]   can regrow significant amounts of hair.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:40.380]   I've never seen examples of people who were completely bald,
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.200]   meaning lacking all scalp hair
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.900]   to grow back a full head of hair.
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:46.740]   But the combination of microneedling and finasteride
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.940]   is probably the most effective way to go.
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:50.160]   And if you're going to do that,
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:52.020]   there's no reason why you couldn't also use
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:55.580]   ketoconazole shampoo, couldn't also use salt palmetto.
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:56.860]   There's no reason to think that these things
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.080]   collide with one another.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.660]   Although anytime you're inhibiting a DHT pathway
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:03.020]   or whether or not you're increasing or decreasing
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:04.820]   any hormone pathway for that matter,
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:06.220]   you want to be careful about layering
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.600]   in too many different treatments
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.060]   because you don't want your DHT level to go too low.
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.500]   I mean, let's keep in mind that
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.600]   even if you take a very low dose of finasteride
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.900]   and reduce your DHT and don't have side effects,
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.920]   maybe just the mere addition of salt palmetto,
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:21.380]   which leads to a slight reduction in DHT
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.080]   combined with some caffeine ointment
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:24.720]   would be sufficient enough to start inducing
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:27.500]   some of the low DHT associated side effects.
[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.340]   So you really have to see for you.
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:31.800]   And that's one of the major issues in this whole field
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.580]   of hair growth and regrowth
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.140]   is that people are highly individual in their response
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:39.940]   and in their side effect profile to these various treatments.
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:41.120]   But there's an enormous range there.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.560]   And unfortunately, there's no way to know a priori
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:45.960]   before doing these treatments,
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.760]   what your response is going to be in terms of side effects.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.220]   So you're simply going to have to explore.
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:51.380]   And I would hope that you would explore
[02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:54.700]   starting with minimal possible effective dosages
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.960]   and to do that in coordination with a medical professional.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.420]   So you could really evaluate these things
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:01.140]   at the level of blood and cosmetic changes.
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:03.060]   And in fact, that's a pretty good motivator
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:04.480]   for thinking about the different treatments
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.860]   that we talked about today.
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:08.280]   Everything from mechanical treatments,
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.500]   as simple as massage, which we've all heard about,
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.700]   but for which there really aren't a lot of data
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.700]   for supporting hair growth.
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:16.120]   But certainly things like microneedling,
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.740]   which is a mechanical stimulus
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.580]   for which there are pretty good data
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.540]   that it can improve hair growth.
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:26.000]   Also things like Saul Palmetto, a weak DHT antagonist.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.980]   Also things like ketoconazole shampoo,
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.660]   which again is a weak DHT antagonist
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:33.080]   and operates through some other pathways as well
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.300]   to stimulate hair growth.
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:37.860]   My suggestion is that anyone, young, old, male, female,
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.400]   who's thinking about embarking on various treatments
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.140]   for offsetting hair loss and stimulating hair growth,
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:45.040]   consider both mechanical approaches
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:48.120]   and the approaches that attack the chemical pathways
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.820]   that can stimulate hair growth
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:53.460]   and can inhibit the inhibitors of hair growth.
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:55.500]   In fact, that's the reason why we spend so much time
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.160]   on the biology of hair growth
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.080]   and what shuts down hair growth early on in today's episode.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.180]   And then systematically went through
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:05.900]   each of the various treatments that relies on,
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:08.040]   and in some cases hinges entirely on,
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:11.060]   either a mechanical stimulus or a chemical stimulus
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.880]   in order to exert its effects.
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:14.540]   My goal today was not to overwhelm you
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.780]   with a ton of biology about hair,
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:18.480]   although we did cover a lot of biology
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:20.820]   of hair and stem cells and hair growth.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:23.060]   My goal in describing all that was really for you
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:25.460]   to be able to hear about various treatments,
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:28.420]   whether or not it's lasers or PRP or finasteride,
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:30.980]   dutasteride, or whatever is coming next
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.340]   that we're sure to hear about soon online
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:34.580]   and from the medical community,
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:37.160]   and to be able to place those into bins
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:40.020]   related to their known or potential mechanisms,
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:42.760]   and then to be able to step back and evaluate
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:46.360]   which, if any, of those treatments might be right for you.

[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.660]   During today's podcast and on many previous episodes
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:21.000]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.120]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:25.100]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:27.520]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support,
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.160]   focus, and more.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.700]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:31.920]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.900]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:45.280]   And especially on Instagram,
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:47.360]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:49.100]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.440]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.460]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:53.580]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.860]   Again, it's @hubermanlab on Instagram,

[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:08.700]   and we have what are called toolkits.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:12.280]   Those toolkits range from how to optimize your sleep
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.780]   to how to optimize neuroplasticity.
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.260]   We have toolkits for dopamine.
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:18.140]   We have toolkits for deliberate cold exposure,
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.460]   heat exposure, exercise, and much more.
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.220]   Again, it's totally zero cost to sign up.

[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.740]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion.
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:34.400]   All about the biology of hair and hair growth,
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.220]   how to hold onto the hair you have,
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:38.660]   and to stimulate new hair growth.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.900]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:42.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:45.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.780]   (upbeat music)
