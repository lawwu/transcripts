[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning, are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   And I shall read from verse 19 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Verse 19 to verse 23 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   not only in this world but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all."
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Once more I would call attention to the message of this great chapter,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and especially to this prayer that is here to be found at the end of the chapter.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   The apostle having reminded these Ephesians of the great salvation which they now were sharing with the Jews,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   the Jewish Christians, having displayed all that to them, begins to pray for them,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and tells them how he constantly is praying for them.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He thanks God for them, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He thanks God for their faith and for their love towards all the saints,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   but he goes on to offer petitions for them.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   His great petition for them is that they may have the spirit of wisdom and of revelation
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   in the knowledge of God.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The end of all things is the knowledge of God.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It is the goal of the Christian faith and the Christian life.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And however much we may be enjoying blessings and experiences,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   if we don't come to an ever deeper knowledge of God, we are failing.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But he doesn't leave it at that. He prays also that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   that they may know certain things in particular.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And there are three main things you remember.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The first is that they may come to know what is the hope of their calling.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Secondly, what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And thirdly and lastly, what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward that believe.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Now we are considering that.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We've been looking at this great chapter,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   conceivably the greatest single chapter in the entire scriptures.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   We've been looking at it for a long time.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   For those who are statistically minded and those who attend here regularly,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   it may be of interest to notice that this is the 38th time that we have looked at this chapter together.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And so we bring to a conclusion this morning,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   our consideration of the message of this noble and moving and most eloquent statement.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And we deal again I say with this last petition.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The apostle is so anxious that these people may know
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   the exceeding great power of God,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   the energy of the strength of God's might that is working in them.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He doesn't pray that they may have more power.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You notice that what he prays for is that they may come to know and to realize the power that is already working in them.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And that is characteristic of his message everywhere.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He prays it urgently.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Because obviously there is nothing which is so strengthening to faith,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   nothing which will so enable us to continue in the Christian life and warfare,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   as a realization of these things.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Now let me put that again once more in the form of a principle.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I think all Christian people are anxious to have joy and to have power in their lives.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But far too frequently we make the mistake of approaching the situation much too subjectively.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Of course experience is essential.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And if we haven't experience of the truth our knowledge of it is valueless.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It is meant to lead to experience.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But there is nothing which is so fatal as to concentrate on experience only.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The way to have a rich experience in the Christian life as I understand the New Testament,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   is to grasp the New Testament teaching.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   To grasp the New Testament truth.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And that is why the Apostle is praying for this.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Desiring as he does that these Ephesians may enjoy their Christian life and that they may triumph in it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   He knows the high road to that is this.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   That they may know this truth which God has revealed through the Spirit.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And that they may understand it and grasp it and live in its strength and in its power.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   In other words the way to a rich subjective experience is a clearer objective understanding.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   People who neglect doctrine will never have a big experience.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The higher road to experience is truth.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And to concentrate on experience alone is generally to find your Christian life bound in shallows and in miseries.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Well very well that's what the Apostle is doing here.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And I say that he is anxious that they should understand this exceeding great power of God that is working in them.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   He knows they can't understand it without the illumination of the Spirit.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So he's prayed that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Now we've already looked at this in general.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We've considered the Apostle's exact description of the power.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The terms he uses.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   We've gone on to consider why it is we need this power.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We have seen that we cannot even believe the Gospel apart from this power of God that works in us.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   A man by his own energy and power cannot believe the Gospel.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The natural man understandeth not the things of the Spirit of God, they are foolishness unto him.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   How can a man who is dead in trespasses and in sins do anything spiritually? He can't.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We all must be quickened by the power of God.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And if we are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ this morning, it is entirely because the power of God has been working in us.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   But we need it as we continue in the Christian life.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And we've considered that.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And then last Sunday morning we came to this.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   The Apostle tells us that this power comes into us and works in us and through us
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   in terms of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You remember he's got a doctrine of the church here.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   He says the church which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So that we saw that the energy and the might and the strength of God in Christ
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   comes to us in exactly the same way as nervous energy comes to every part and portion of the body
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   from the brain through this intimate organic connection of part with part.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   As every muscle in my body, in my limbs, receives its force and its energy and its power originally from my brain,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   so every member of the body of Christ is intimately connected with him,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   is in an organic relationship to him, and his energy comes through to us.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's how it works.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   So that you see, the important thing for us is to realize two things.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   The first is obviously what is true about him.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And then the second thing is our relationship to him.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Now all the energy that I have as an individual Christian
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   comes to me because I am a member in the body of Christ.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And the energy in the members is the energy that comes from the head.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well now then, if I am to know therefore the exceeding greatness of God's power towards me as a believer,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   the thing that I must take hold of is the energy that is in the head,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the resources that are in Christ,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   the everlasting, illimitable power that God has placed in him.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He's treasured up in him.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   All his treasures of wisdom and of grace and of glory and of power,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   it's all there, and I am in him.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   That's the thing I've got to address.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And then I say I must be perfectly clear as to this doctrine of my intimate union with him as a member of the body,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and that what is true of me is true of all other Christians in exactly the same way.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Very well, let's proceed to look at it together hurriedly.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   If I may say so in passing, and you'll forgive me for this,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I rather like finishing on this note.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   There is no better note to finish a period of service on than this,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   the glory and the preeminence of Christ.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   We've seen how the apostle keeps on repeating the blessed name as he goes through his chapter.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   He starts with him, Paul.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   What is Paul? He's an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   When he comes to a benediction, this is it,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He goes on repeating the name.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   He rejoiced in it, he gloried in it, and in it alone.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And therefore let us, I say, look together at his glory, at his greatness,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   at the power of his might which comes into us and is working in us.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   What is it that is true of him?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Well, let's first of all look at the actual description.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The apostle tells us that if we are to understand this power working in us,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   we must see it as it is illustrated in what God has done in Christ,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I've already dealt with that, so I won't stay with that this morning.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   But what a display of power that was,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   when all the forces of evil and of hell, when death and the grave were trying to hold him.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   He was raised by the mighty power of God.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Death couldn't hold him, the grave couldn't contain him.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   He burst asunder the bands of death, the power of God.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Ah, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   There is something still more wonderful,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   That's it.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   That's the place where our blessed Lord is at this moment.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   God raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   What's it mean?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Well, that is always the mark, is it not, of honor?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And likewise the mark of authority.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   If you want to pay any person honor, you put such a person to sit at your right hand.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   If it's a dinner, if it's a party, whatever it is,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   that's the way to honor a friend or a person, a visitor,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   is to put such a person at your right hand.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It's the place of supreme honor.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And it is there that the Lord Jesus Christ has been set by his Father.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   The highest place which heaven affords is his, and his by right.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Yes, but it not only marks honor, it is also indicative of authority.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   The right hand is always the place of authority.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And the apostle here reminds us that God has raised his Son from the dead
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and has placed him there, and has thus placed upon him, as we shall see,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   a peculiar authority at the right hand of God.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Now it's very difficult for us to take this in, but the scripture is full of it.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You've got it, you remember, in that great passage in the second chapter of the epistle to the Philippians,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   "Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name that is above every other name," and so on.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   See, my dear, the right hand of God, honor and authority.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   There is no higher position, there is no greater place, and he's there.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But the apostle, you see, was so moved at the thought of it that he goes on in his description of it.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   "Hath set him at his own right hand in the heavenlies, far above all principality and power,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and might and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this world,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   but also in the world which is to come."
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Now there he is, set above all powers.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Now, of course, the learned commentators, as is their way,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   when they come to this passage, they spend most of their time, alas,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   in trying to work out as to who these powers and mights and principalities and dominions, etc., are.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Are they thinking of evil angels or of good angels? That's their question, and they discuss it.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   It seems to me the answer is perfectly simple.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   He has been placed in a position of authority and honor, which is above that of all powers.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   There are evil powers, and there are tremendous powers.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, as they say, men, at the end of this epistle,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   against spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Men and women who underestimate the power of the devil and of hell and all their cohorts
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   are mere tyrants in this Christian faith.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   The world is as it is today because of these principalities and powers,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   these unseen spiritual forces.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But the Son of God is above, far above them all,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   greater in might and dignity and majesty and position.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But I believe that this refers not only to such powers, but also to the angels,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   the good angels, the blessed angels.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   He has been set above them all.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Now, you can find the perfect description of that if you read the first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   where the author tells us something about the greatness of the angels and their power,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and then he ends it by saying, "But after all, they are but ministering spirits.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   They are not the Son."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   They haven't this uniqueness.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   He hasn't said to any of them, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That is reserved only for his own Son.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So that I believe that here the apostle is telling us
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is elevated and exalted this moment,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   even above the archangel Gabriel, beyond Michael,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   the express special servants of God.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   He is above them all.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   He is even at the right hand, sharing the throne with his own Father.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Far above all principality and might and dominion and power, etc.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Well, now you see the thing we must hold in our minds,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   that it's there you measure this power of God, which he has displayed in Christ.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   He has taken him from earth and has elevated him and has raised him to that position.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   That's the power.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   But not only that, he says, he has put all things under his feet.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   What a tremendous statement.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Everything is in subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   God the Father has put all things under his feet.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   He walks upon them.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   He is master of every one.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Or to look at it positively, we look at it like this,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   and gave him to be the head over all things.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   God has made his Son the controller of the universe.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He is the controller of the material universe.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Wings an angel, guides a sparrow.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   When God made the world, he didn't make it to use the old analogy,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   as a watchmaker makes a watch and winds it up and leaves it.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   No, no, the universe is sustained actively by God,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   and he has handed that over to the Son.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He is the controller, he is the head over all things.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   He controls the stars in their courses, the ocean in its movement,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   the wind and the rain, the hurricane and the storm,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   the sunshine, everything, all life is in his hands.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He is the head over all things, the material universe,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   yes, but also the moral universe and the spiritual universe.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   God has made him the head of it all.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He has given him this dignity, the creator of the universe,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   the artificer, the controller of the cosmos,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   has handed it over to the Son.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He is in control of everything, everywhere.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   That's the description.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   But now it does seem to me to be vitally important
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   that we should realize certain things in particular
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   with respect to that description.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And the first is this,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   we have to realize that these things are already true.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Now I'm anxious that I shouldn't be misunderstood at this point,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   but I often have a suspicion and a fear
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   that there are some friends who are so anxious
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   to emphasize the glory of the visible kingdom
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and reign of Christ which are coming,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   that they are guilty unconsciously of detracting
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   of what is already true about him.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   They spend so much of their time in looking to the future
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   that they forget the present,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and they underestimate the present position
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   of the Lord and of his people.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Their attitude seems to be that we've just got to wait now
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and keep going somehow because of the glory that is coming.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Far be it from me to detract from the glory that is coming.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's the thing to which we look.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It is the blessed hope on which we should set our affections.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   But my friends, let's remember what is true at this moment.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   God hath wrought these things in Christ.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He has raised him from the dead.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   He has set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   far above these powers.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And he hath put all things under his feet,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and he has given him to be the head over all things.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And it is because, I think we often forget this,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   that we are often so fearful,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and so alarmed and terrified,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and become so excited because we think that the kingdom of Christ
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   is going to be defeated in this world
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and we must do something to save it,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   like the man who put his hand upon the ark
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   to steady it on that cart so long ago.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's because we fail to realize this truth.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ himself should have put us right about this.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   He has already said,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It's already been given.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   When he gave that commission to his disciples to go out to preach
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and to disciple the nations, he says,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   "Go, remembering that all power has been given unto me.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I have it all. There is none lacking."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   He isn't going to receive it. He has it.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   He has it at this moment.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   He already is controlling history.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It was the lamb that had been slain
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   that was alone strong enough to take that book with the seals in heaven
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   that John saw in the vision,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   and tear off the seals and open the scroll of history.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   He's the Lord of history. He's already the Lord of history.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Jesus Christ isn't outside history,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and history isn't working itself out apart from him.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   He controls it at this moment.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   It's in his hands. He's unfolding it.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   "For he must reign," says Paul to the Corinthians
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   in the 15th chapter of the first epistle.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   He must reign.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He is reigning, and he'll go on reigning
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   until his enemies have been made his footstool.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   My dear friend, don't allow your thoughts about the coming kingdom
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   to rob you of the realization of the fact
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   that the Lord Jesus Christ is reigning now.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   He is glorified. The crown is upon his brow.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   He is the king at this moment.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   He's going to come in a visible manner,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   but he is king now as certainly as he will be then.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Let us therefore not fail to realize this.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   May the eyes of our understanding be enlightened
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   that we may know this.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   But let me give you one final quotation.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It was there in that reading from the second chapter
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   of the epistle to the Hebrews at the beginning.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Here it is.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   For in that he put all in subjection under him,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   he left nothing that is not put under him," referring to men.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   But now we see not yet all things put under him.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Everything is not yet under men.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   But we see Jesus,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   We see him crowned with glory and honor already.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Very well then, I say, there is the thing that we have to realize.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   That this has already happened to the Lord.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   He is already in that position.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   God has elevated him already to that place of honor and authority.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But let us also bear in mind that all this has been given to him
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   and has been done to him because of what he has done.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   In the epistle to the Philippians in that second chapter,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   the word which connects the exaltation with the humiliation is this,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "Wherefore, it was because he counted it not robbery to be equal with God,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   but emptied himself and came down
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and humbled himself even to the death of the cross.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Wherefore, God hath also highly exalted him."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And the apostle has the same idea here.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It is because he came down so low to redeem us and to rescue us
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   that God has set him at his own right hand.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   But to me the most precious part of this statement is this.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   That all this has been given to him as the mediator,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   as the God-man.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   There he is at the right hand of God this moment.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   But remember that he is there not as the eternal son only.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   As the eternal son he was there before the foundation of the world.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   He was there from eternity.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   He is one with the Father, co-equal, co-eternal.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He always shared it, the glory which I had with thee from the beginning he says.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   But here we read that God hath raised him and hath exalted him to that.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   What does it mean?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Well, he is thinking about him as the son of man.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   He is thinking of him as the God-man.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And it is here I say we discover the most precious truth of all.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Listen to Paul again in that second chapter of Philippians.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and hath given him a name which is above every other name."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Listen to this.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   "That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   He doesn't say at the name of the son of God.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Not at the name of the Lord, but at the name of Jesus.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It is as Jesus that he has thus been exalted.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It is of the son of man.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Now what does that mean?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Well, it means this, you see.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   That human nature has been raised to that height of glory.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   The apostles' purpose here, as I have not been tired of reminding you,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   is a very practical one.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It isn't a theological disquisition.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   He is anxious to help these people, and this is what he is saying.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   You must realize that the power in you is as great as this.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   It has taken human nature in Jesus,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and it has raised human nature in him and with him to the right hand of God.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And it is there now with all this authority and power.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Human nature has been elevated to that height in him.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   What a staggering thought.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   The one who is at the right hand of God,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   far above all principality and power and might and dominion,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   the one under whose feet all things are,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and to whom all power and authority has been given,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   is the one who once was lying helplessly in a manger in Bethlehem, a babe.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He is the little boy who was arguing with the doctors in the law at the age of twelve.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   He is the carpenter of Nazareth.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He is the young man who went out to preach at the age of thirty.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   He is the one who knew what it was to be weak and sat down at the side of a well one afternoon
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   because he was tired and couldn't go and accompany his disciples to buy provisions.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   He is the one who slept of sheer fatigue in a boat.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   He is the one who was crucified through weakness
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and apparently defeated by cruel men and their machinations.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It is he, Jesus, who has thus been raised.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And that is the way, I say, to measure the exceeding greatness of God's power.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Because when he became man, when he took unto him human nature,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   he was made like unto his brethren, subject to temptation,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   subject to these frailties of the flesh, these weaknesses.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He was subject to it all, human nature.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   He didn't stretch a helping hand, said that second chapter of Hebrews, to angels,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   but to the seed of Abraham.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And that's what he took upon him.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And in him your human nature and mine has been raised to the heights.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   That's the power of God.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   God has done all this to him and has given all this to him as the mediator,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   as the God-man, as Jesus, son of man, son of God.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And then the last special thing that I would emphasize here is this,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   that God has given all this to him for the church.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I sometimes wonder how it is that we as Christian people can remain in our seats.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Why it is that we are not lost in a sense of wonder, love, and praise?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Listen to this.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   God has raised him from the dead and has set him at his own right hand
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   in the supreme position of glory, has put everything under his feet,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   and has made him the head of all things for the church,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   for the sake of the church.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   That he might exercise it all in the interests of the church,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   in order that he might finally redeem his people and present them faultless to God.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   That's why he has given it to him for the church, for you and for me.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Not for his own sake, not that he may there be a spectator of the glory of his Father,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   not that he may exercise this great power and enjoy it, but for our sakes, for the church.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Very well then, what does this mean to us?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Let me put it to you in a number of simple statements.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Because of this doctrine of the church as the body of Christ,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   because I am in him and a member of his mystical body,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I'm almost afraid to say it, but it's the truth,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   because of that, what is true of him is true of me.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It's true of all of us who are Christians.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   The church which is his body, he's given it all to him for the church,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Oh, the privilege of being a Christian.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Oh, the honor of being a Christian.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   You see these poor people in the world vying with one another for some honor,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   or for some position, to be near some notable personality,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   what they'll pay for it, what they'll sacrifice for it,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   yet every one of us, whoever we are and however unimportant this morning,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   if we are Christians and in Christ, we are sharing in this position.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   It's true of us now positionally.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   We shall see when we get to the sixth verse of the second chapter,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   that Paul says, "And hath raised us up together,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   and hath made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Already?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   You can't separate the head and the body.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   You can't sever the trunk from the head.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   If you do so, the life is ended.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   What is true of the head is true of the whole body.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   The head is there, the body is there, mystically, spiritually.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Yes, but you see the whole thing the apostle was anxious for these Ephesians to grasp was this,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that it's not only true positionally of us now,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   it is going to be true of us actually and absolutely and in fact.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Come back again to that second chapter of Hebrews and follow the man's argument.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   "Don't misunderstand me," says that author,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   "the world to come about which I'm trying to tell you,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   God has not prepared for angels but for us."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Not for angels hath he put in subjection this world to come of which we speak,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   but for us.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And then he quotes his eighth psalm, you remember.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "What is man that thou art mindful of him?"
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And then the description.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "Thou hast set him over all, thou hast made him the Lord of creation,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   thou hast put all things under his feet."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And then he stops and says, "Ah, wait a minute.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Am I going too far?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Am I going too far when I say that that is what God has destined for men
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and that that is what is going to happen to men?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Let me see."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And then he says, "We see not yet all things put under him."
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   That isn't true yet of men, but he says it's going to be true.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Well, how does he know that?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Well, this is his own answer.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   "We see not yet all things put under him, but we see Jesus."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Already in that position.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And because we are in him, it's going to be true of us.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   "Know ye not," says Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   "know ye not that he shall judge angels?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Know ye not that we shall judge the world?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Know you not that it is true that Christ said this?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   That as his Father had given him to share the throne with him,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   so we are going to share his throne with him.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   We see not yet all things put under us, but we see Jesus.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   We shall be lords of creation.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   We shall reign with Christ.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   We shall share his supremacy.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   We are members of his body.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Nothing can prevent it."
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   But even now our position is wonderful.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   "Don't you realize the truth about yourselves,"
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   says the apostle to the Corinthians again in the first chapter.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   They were talking about Paul and Apollos and Cephas
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and trying to stake their claims.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   "Foolish people," he says, "all things are yours,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   or things present or things to come.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   All are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is God's."
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   That's true now because of our relationship to him.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   But let me say a glancing word about the safety of our position, therefore.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   If that's the privilege of our position, consider it safety.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   "Fearful saint, ye fearful saints, fresh courage take."
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Why? Well, let another hymn ensue.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   "Promit thou all thy griefs and ways into his hands,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   to his wise truth and tender care,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   who earth and heaven commands,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   who points the clouds their course,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   whom winds and seas obey.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   He shall direct thy wandering feet.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   He shall prepare thy way,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   so that as you feel your weakness and your ineptitude
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   and as you are conscious of the forces that are set against you,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   remember that he, the head of the body to which you belong,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   is at the right hand of God,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   with all authority and power in his hands,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   controlling the universe and the cosmos,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   everything under his feet,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   all power given to him, head over all things.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   He can direct everything,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   the wind and the storm, the rain and the sunshine.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   He can order all things and is doing so for you."
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Let us realize the safety of our position.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But that of necessity leads me to say a word about the mystery of our position.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   If you tell me, says someone, that all that is true
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and that I am related to him in that way,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   why is it that I ever have to suffer?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Why is it that I am ever taken ill?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Why is it that calamities ever visit me?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Why is it that my crops are ever ruined by storms?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Why should anyone dear to me die?
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Why isn't it therefore that I am not having a perfect life without any problems at all?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   The answer is the mystery of our position in him.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   We don't understand it, but we know this.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   This is a part of the process of our sanctification.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth."
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   It isn't that he cannot commend all these things, he doesn't choose to.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It would be a very bad thing for us if he did.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Alas, as the result of sin and its operations within us,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   he has to chastise us.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   He knows what's best for us.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   There are times when we need the sunshine.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   There are times when we benefit by the storm.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   The psalmist can say, "It was good for me that I have been afflicted,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   because before I was afflicted I went astray."
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   There's many a man who's thanked God for loss, for bereavement, for illness, for sorrow.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   It perfected his soul.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   His spirit was safeguarded.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   He knows best.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   His heart is love, and we are in his hands.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   What you and I have to remember therefore is that nothing can happen to us apart from him,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and that all things work together for good to them that love God.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   It isn't that he can't, it isn't that he doesn't want to.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   He's concerned about our holiness, about our ultimate happiness,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and he orders all things for our good.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Let us rest in his love and in the power of his might,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   so that finally we come to this.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   In the light of this elevated, exalted doctrine,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   our final position is absolutely certain and sure.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   The final security and perseverance of the saints is beyond doubt,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   because we are members of his body,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   and because he is set at the right hand of God
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   in this place of absolute authority and might and dominion.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   There is nothing that is more certain than this.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He must reign till he has put all his enemies under his feet.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Nothing can stop him.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   He is the master of them all.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   He defeated the devil while he was here on earth.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   He routed him upon the cross.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   He has mastered him.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   The devil is under control.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   He has not uncontrolled power.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   He's already conquered.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   He's a defeated foe.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   As certainly as the Lord Jesus Christ rose from the grave,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   we shall rise from the grave.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   And we shall rise without corruption.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   We shall be without spot or blemish or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   We shall be faultless and blameless.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   It is absolutely certain.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   The fact that the head has risen is a guarantee that the body must rise.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   We shall rise.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   We are already risen spiritually.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   We shall rise physically, materially, bodily.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Nothing can stop it.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   I am persuaded therefore that neither death nor life,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   How can they?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   He's above them all, far above them all.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   All are beneath His feet.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   He's got all the power and He governs and controls everything.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   He's the head of the universe and I belong to Him.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Nor devil nor hell can ever pluck me out of His hands,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   nor any force nor might.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   In Him we are safe, we are secure,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   and our final destiny is assured and certain.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Beloved Christian people,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   do you know these things?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Do you live in the light of them and in the strength of them?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Do you now understand why Paul prayed for these Ephesians
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and all others who were to receive this circular letter?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   With such assiduity and persistence,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   he prays that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   They must know the hope of their calling.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   They must be sure of it.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   They must know something of the exceeding riches of His grace
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and His inheritance in the saints.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Have you tasted the firstfruits?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Have my words this morning been idle words?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Did you expect me to preach on the Geneva conference
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   or on something like that?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And are you disappointed?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Are you thinking only of this world
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   or do you know something about the next?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Have you had glimpses of it?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Have you looked into it?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Have you tasted of the harvest that's coming?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Has it ravished your heart?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Has your appetite been stimulated?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Are these things real to you?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   That's what he was praying for.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And do you know, feeble, defeated saint this morning,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   that all this power of God is in you?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It's there because you are in Christ.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   His life is flowing into you.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Realize it.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Believe it.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Trust to it.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Act upon it.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And it will come with still greater force.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   and the exceeding greatness of his power in usward that believe,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   which he exercised in Christ
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   when he raised him from the dead
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and set him at his own right hand in the heavenlies,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   far above all principality and power and might and dominion
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   and every name that is named,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   not only in this world,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   but also in the world that is to come,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and hath put all things under his feet,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and hath set him as the head over all things for the church,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   which is his body,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Oh, may God by his Spirit open our eyes to these things.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Christian people, realize your inheritance.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Dwell upon it.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Meditate upon it.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Read about it.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Pray concerning it
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   until your heart is ravished and moved and overwhelmed.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
