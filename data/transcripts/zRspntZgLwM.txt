[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   Well, we are going to talk tonight about leadership at work.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.320]   This is part of a longer series, as you know.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.160]   And I thought I would start off tonight with something that was pretty formative in my
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.200]   thinking and in my experience in my career.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.780]   As a much younger man, much younger man, nearly 40 years ago, I was thrown into an environment
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.960]   of a Fortune 500 company and all the politics and the challenges and the opportunity that
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120]   that brings.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760]   I loved it.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.880]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.540]   I had been assigned a role in senior management of that division where I served alongside
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.040]   some of the most capable and even brilliant people I've had the privilege to work with.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.600]   And one of the senior executives in that company was a man, I'll call him Bill, who had achieved
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.440]   a position of significant authority and responsibility over hundreds of employees.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:11.400]   My first and early impressions were that Bill was experienced, he was deeply respected,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.880]   and that he was very much what I wanted to be, because to top it all off, he was an outspoken
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880]   Christian.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.140]   I say outspoken because he led staff meetings on a weekly basis in his department and he
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.420]   started off with prayer and a Bible study.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.360]   And if you worked in his department, you were going to hear the gospel.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.080]   In fact, if you went in his office for very long, you were going to hear the gospel.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.560]   That's leadership at work, right?
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.520]   There's a guy I could follow, that I could admire, that I could emulate, and I began
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   to think maybe I could ask him to disciple me because he seemed to be everything that
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.680]   I thought I wanted to be.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200]   Nope.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.760]   It turned out that he had been directed several times to stop those Bible studies on company
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:11.160]   time and his resistance to submit to his employer was perhaps, in his mind, a strike for religious
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.480]   freedom and the Great Commission.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.680]   But in reality, he was disobeying the commands in the Bible for employees, and that was a
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.640]   prelude as it usually is to other character issues.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.680]   It turned out his weekly Bible study and office demeanor was flagrant hypocrisy.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.520]   Employees began to confide in me that Bill was well known on business trips to be a philanderer
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.440]   and a hard drinker.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.000]   And then in short order, similar behaviors came to light that was not limited to business
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.400]   trips.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.840]   So in the end, I did learn a lot from Bill, just not the lessons I thought I was going
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   to learn.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.320]   I learned how not to conduct myself at work, and I learned in sad and stark lessons what
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.920]   leadership at work does not look like.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.560]   Leadership at work is an area of great interest, particularly among young, ambitious men.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.100]   And I don't say that as a negative.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.880]   As we'll see, the venue of work and the opportunity to achieve leadership roles and added responsibility
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.640]   is not random.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.520]   But to fully appreciate the task of leadership, we have to know and understand God's view
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.680]   of work and let that inform how we lead and how we define even what leadership is in the
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   workplace.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.560]   And we'll begin with the big picture, and I just want you to know tonight, we're doing
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.920]   a survey through Scripture.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.960]   I pray I don't get in the way, because I want you to see from the Word of God, and it's
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.840]   reflected on your handout, that there's a lot in the Bible about work.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.200]   And it starts in Genesis chapter 1.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.520]   And in Genesis 1 verse 27, that great verse, "God created man in his own image, and the
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   image of God he created, a male and female he created them."
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.400]   And then starting in verse 28 is a description of why he created you, why he created me,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.540]   what was the task.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.840]   And as I read through this, I want you to listen to this or read through this with an
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.080]   eye towards work.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   Because everything I'm about to read to you describes work.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.000]   Verse 28, "God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.520]   the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.040]   of the sky, and over every living thing that creeps on the earth.'
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.840]   Then God said, 'Behold, I've given to you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.560]   of the earth, and every tree which has the fruit of the tree yielding seed, it shall
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   be food for you, and to every beast of the earth, and every bird of the sky, and to everything
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   that creeps on the earth, which has life, I have given every green plant for food.'
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   And it was so.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.160]   And God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good, and there was evening and
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.280]   there was morning the sixth day."
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.920]   And you say, "I didn't hear a lot of work there."
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.320]   Well, I want to help you see a lot of work there.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.680]   Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.920]   That speaks to family.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.120]   And all the men who have had children or have young children probably want to say amen.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.680]   That's work.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.800]   And in Genesis 1, before sin enters the world, right after he forms and creates man, he describes
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.280]   the work of man.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.220]   To be married, to have children, to multiply and to fill the earth.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.220]   That is work.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.000]   He talks about, he goes on to say, "Subdue the earth.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.920]   Don't just fill the earth with children, with offspring, but subdue it."
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.960]   And that word subdue connotes work.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.320]   It's far removed from our culture today, but if you've ever been on a farm or you know
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.000]   a farmer, they can describe to you how much work it takes to subdue the earth.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.360]   It takes work.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.100]   And it goes on to say we're to have dominion over the fish and over the creeping and crawling
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.580]   things and over everything that grows that produces food and seeds to plant more.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.100]   That's all work.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.580]   Managing and ruling this earth is a laborious task.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.020]   Converting animals and vegetation to food, clothing, and shelter requires work.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.780]   And yes, that is what animals are for.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.860]   The mandate for God's creation is that you and I work.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.700]   Genesis 1 is not directed to just men.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.820]   The work of a woman and a man by God's design is far more than just a job or your employment
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.100]   that dominates our life.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.380]   Our employment is one part of the work we're called to do.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.180]   Work is what every man and woman was created to do.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.320]   So tonight, stepping down and back from that broad definition of work, I am going to refer
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.580]   from this point forward to your employment, to your leadership in the workplace.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.140]   That's the aspect of work that we'll focus on.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:41.620]   Leadership at work as God designed it has little to do with your title, with your responsibilities
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.500]   at work, or where you are on the org chart.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.220]   There is no imperative in the Bible that the Christian must aspire to the office of the
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:58.140]   chief executive officer or whatever the top of the pyramid is where you work.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:04.480]   The Bible does not say that such a pursuit is virtuous and the Bible doesn't prevent
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.140]   or speak ill of that pursuit.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.940]   There is no biblical prerogative that you must lead at work in that sense.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.340]   That even if you're the low man on the totem pole, the lowest of the low on the org chart,
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.300]   you are called to lead at work.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.460]   You are to bring spiritual leadership to your job and we understand that every area of life
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.780]   is spiritual.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.800]   Your work is not a secular area of your life.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.240]   As we'll see, your work for an employer is a spiritual endeavor.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:46.140]   For believers, work is a spiritual effort in a thoroughly, sometimes secular environment.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:53.020]   And that secular environment, just to be clear, does not mean that your work is to be viewed
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.140]   as secular.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.500]   To understand how we lead at work, we need to understand the nature of that secular environment
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.520]   and we've already covered this in another session.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:10.260]   But just as a review, success in your job at its most basic level is results.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.900]   You either produce or you won't be successful as they define successful and you may find
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.700]   yourself unemployed.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.420]   With that reality in mind, let's talk about briefly what spiritual leadership is.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.060]   And again, this is review from a previous session.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:36.040]   But secular leadership in a secular work environment, it's all results, produce.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.600]   Spiritual leadership in a secular work environment or whatever the work environment is, results
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.800]   with character.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   That's it.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   It's simple.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.880]   To be very clear, you and I, we are not exempt from the requirement that we fulfill our employer's
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   expectations for whatever it is we're trying to produce.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   We need to do that.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.160]   Your spiritual status does not override that reality or the consequences of failure in
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.680]   that regard.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.720]   The Bible makes clear, as we'll see tonight, that you and I are to work, we're to be good
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.360]   and even excellent at the work that we do, we are to be submissive to the rules and leadership
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:29.320]   in our workplace, and we're to do all of that with integrity and grace.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.040]   In summary, that's leadership at work, regardless of your title.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.080]   And there's an immediate problem when we start to talk about work and employment, and that
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   is the natural inclination of sinful man towards laziness, self-interest, and sin.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.360]   That conflict comes into play pretty quickly.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.040]   In fact, in Proverbs 6, in the middle of a series of conversations that a father is having
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.240]   with his children, you read that famous passage, "Go to the aunt, oh what?
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.200]   He called his son a sluggard."
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.880]   Can you believe that?
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.400]   "Go to the aunt, oh sluggard, consider her ways and be wise," and this is a father training
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:22.280]   his son as quickly and early as possible to develop the disciplines that kill laziness.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.600]   Unfortunately, our culture and the United States economy is now known for its millions
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:38.540]   of men who never learn the discipline of killing laziness and the disciplines of working hard.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:46.840]   In 2016, Nicholas Eberstadt wrote a book called "Men Without Work, America's Invisible Crisis,"
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.400]   and he described in great detail the state of work for men in modern America from a purely
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.920]   statistical and even secular perspective.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.200]   It was a stunning book at that time.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.280]   I actually got to meet him and talk to him about his book, and I don't think he had any
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.760]   idea how biblical his book was.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.780]   It wasn't his intent.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.820]   His study concluded in 2016 that men were not going to work in record numbers.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.920]   This was not because work was unavailable, it was because men had lost the imperative
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.540]   and the initiative to work.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:33.260]   In 2016, in a booming economy, America had sunk to depression era work rates for men
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.620]   of what's called prime age, 25 to 54.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:46.900]   In 2016, at that time, over 6 million healthy and capable prime age men were neither working
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:55.980]   nor even looking for work in an economy where there were millions of jobs available.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:02.540]   And admittedly, the modern workplace since 2016 certainly hasn't made it any easier.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.780]   If anything, it's gotten more complicated.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.420]   Some of you have lived this since 2020.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.600]   Your job is no longer where you just earn a living.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.640]   The workplace has become a battleground for politics, wokeism, your worldview, on trial
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.340]   every day.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.840]   In 2022, you may recall this, the Apple employees famously declared that being required to return
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.620]   to work was actually racist.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:40.500]   While Nicholas Eberstadt updated and re-released his book in 2022, that's the light colored
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:47.620]   book, to capture the unfolding disaster imposed by the political and economic events of 2020
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.420]   and 2021.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.500]   And this is his quote, "The truth is that fewer prime age American men are looking for
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.680]   readily available work than at any previous juncture in our history."
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.940]   This trend is being encouraged by a concept called guaranteed minimum income.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.060]   It's a movement by liberals and even Marxists all over the world.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.020]   And minimum income means that between unemployment benefits and other government handouts, increasing
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.580]   numbers of men cannot afford to work.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.480]   They don't want to lose their benefits.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:31.220]   They can't earn more than the government will give them to not work.
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.660]   Laziness has been elevated to her virtue and now it's seen by many as a financially wise
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.260]   decision.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.260]   This is obviously an overwhelming evidence of a post-Christian nation if this ever was
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.140]   a Christian nation.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:55.940]   Allowing men and even paying men to not work is a direct attack by Satan on the design
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:05.140]   of God for his creation and perhaps dramatic evidence of Romans 1 type judgment on this
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.060]   nation.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:14.540]   The wealth of this nation is funding and accelerating men peacefully living the desires of their
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:24.900]   sinful hearts, leisure and a level of wealth with no expectation of work.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.980]   Throughout the Bible, we see God's view of work.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.620]   It is contrary to what I just described.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.060]   We see why he created us to work and how we should approach work.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:40.020]   It's what I call the theology of work and we're going to do an overview of this topic
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:46.000]   tonight and cover a lot of Scripture to see that theology of work and I believe the Bible
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.780]   preaches best and we need to see the mind of God on this topic.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:59.180]   The Word of God needs to inform my thinking and your thinking and that thinking then drives
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.420]   our decisions and our attitudes toward work.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:11.100]   We might expose tonight, maybe the Word of God might expose how much our thinking about
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:18.000]   our job and work has been conformed by and conformed to the world.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.820]   So there's five pillars supporting a biblical worldview when it comes to work and I just
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.580]   want to work through these fairly quickly with you.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:33.940]   The first one is that work is spiritual service of worship and I'm going to start in Romans
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.740]   12, a passage you're familiar with and I think you'll see why, "Therefore, I exhort you brothers
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:47.260]   by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:54.380]   God which is your spiritual service of worship and do not be conformed to this world but
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:01.660]   be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may approve what the will of God
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.980]   is, that which is good and pleasing and perfect."
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.420]   And what is God's good, pleasing, and perfect will for your life?
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:19.160]   There's no doubt about it, there's no question, no ambiguity.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.300]   His will is that you and I would work.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.140]   This includes our job and so much more.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:32.660]   Work is a pursuit that is ordained by our Creator before sin entered the world.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.860]   It is not the curse, it is a blessing.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.500]   Unless you're sick or injured, God's will is pretty clear.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:50.620]   And when we look beyond Genesis 1 into the creation story, in Genesis 2, starting in
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.860]   verse 5, this is before man's been created, "Now no shrub of the field was yet in the
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:02.100]   earth and no plant of the field had yet sprouted for the Lord God had not sent rain upon the
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.440]   earth and there was no man to cultivate the ground."
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.540]   That word cultivate, I'm an accountant so remember this if you know Hebrew, but that
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:18.180]   word in the original language is a bad, okay?
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.680]   Work.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:29.780]   Then the story is that Adam names the animals, or God creates man, later names the animals,
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:35.220]   and then it says, "The Lord God took the man, put him into the Garden of Eden to abod, cultivate
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.380]   it and keep it."
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:47.300]   Abod means to labor, to serve, and it's the same word that's used in two passages that
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.500]   you've heard before.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.460]   Worship the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:03.100]   Psalm 211, that word worship is the same word, abod.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.660]   Psalm 100 verse 2, "Serve the Lord with gladness, come before him with joyful singing," it's
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.300]   the same word, serve, abod.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:19.060]   Work was created by God, it was his idea from the very beginning, he created it, he defines
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:27.880]   it, he governs it, he establishes the purpose of it, and he is worshipped by it.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.980]   Work is worship.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.580]   And to show you that, there's two passages that are pretty central.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.620]   If you're going to look for passages in the Bible that deal with the issue of work, you're
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.280]   probably going to go to Ephesians 6 and Colossians 3.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.820]   And I want to read through these and I want to note something here.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:53.220]   If you have a pen, I want you to mark all the references to God.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:20:00.820]   A passage that on its face is about work, and I want to show you it's maybe not really.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.940]   Verse 5, "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:14.580]   fear and trembling in the integrity of your heart as to Christ, not by way of eye service
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:23.160]   as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, serving
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.820]   with goodwill as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:36.200]   does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.400]   And masters do the same thing to them and give up threatening knowing that both their
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:48.160]   master," capital M, "their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.320]   him."
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Passage all about work references God seven times by my count.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   There's a reason for that.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.200]   There's three imperatives to the employee in that passage.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.880]   We are to be obedient, we're to have integrity, and we're to serve with goodwill as to the
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.080]   Lord.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.600]   Work is worship.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.240]   Colossians 3, another go-to passage.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   It's on the screen.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.480]   "Slaves in all things, obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:29.200]   eye service as men pleasers, but with integrity of heart, fearing the Lord.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.520]   Whatever you do, do your work heartily as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:43.640]   that from the Lord you will receive the reward of inheritance, serve the Lord Christ."
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:51.160]   By my count, there's four references in that short passage to the Lord, to our God, the
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.720]   one who gave us work, the one who created work.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.840]   The same commands are in both passages, obey, serve with integrity, do your work, serve
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.620]   as to the Lord.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.960]   Work is a spiritual service of worship to Christ.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.920]   And we're not just to be obedient by working with that in mind, but we should learn the
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   discipline and teach to our children the discipline of loving that work as an offering to Christ
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.320]   as worship and as a gift from God.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:35.200]   And that's the second point I want to cover is that work is a gift from God.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.320]   The truth and implication of this truth is one area that many of our minds might need
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:47.720]   to be transformed to consider, because I don't think many of you hear very often like I don't
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.280]   hear very often that work is a gift, do you?
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:00.520]   In our popular culture, we hear that it's a drudgery, it's a pain, it's something to
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.880]   be rid of, it's something to minimize, it's something to do as little as possible.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:15.440]   I even hear some in the church say that work is the curse, and it's easy to fall into that.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.080]   The Bible makes it pretty clear that work is a gift.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.840]   Psalm 104 verse 13, "He, God, waters the mountains from his upper chambers.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.400]   The earth is satisfied with the fruits of his work."
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.640]   And then it describes why.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:38.000]   Verse 14, "He causes the grass to grow for the cattle and vegetation for the labor of
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.100]   man so that he may bring forth food from the earth."
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.000]   God creates work for us, do you see that?
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.800]   He is a work-making God because he gave work to us as a gift.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.160]   Like food is for the cattle, work and labor is for the man.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.920]   In Psalm 128, too, "When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, you will be happy
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.640]   and it will be well with you."
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.000]   It's the blessing of God.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.720]   Ecclesiastes 3, there's a lot of Ecclesiastes in here tonight.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.680]   This is tying in with our study in Ecclesiastes, but verse 12, "I know that there is nothing
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:24.000]   better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.680]   Moreover that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor, it is the," what?
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.120]   It's the gift of God.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.760]   Ecclesiastes 5, 9 repeats that the labor is a gift from God.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.180]   "Work was in the design of creation before sin entered the world and it is not punishment,
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.180]   it is not the curse.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.360]   In fact, it is a gift to his entire creation."
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:25:02.440]   And there's some who in this room, for various reasons, cannot work, sickness, injury, forced
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.960]   retirement at a certain age, and I would expect that most of you who I just referenced have
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.200]   a different understanding of this aspect of work than you used to.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.840]   I've talked to a lot of men who wish they could go back to work.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.920]   I knew of a strong, healthy young man many years ago.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.080]   We were both young fathers at the time.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.840]   He went to work one morning, just like any other day.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:37.340]   In mid-morning, he collapsed at work, and he never left his bed on his own even once
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.600]   from that moment until he died 20 years later.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.320]   That young man might have gone to work that morning with a less than appreciative heart
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   or perspective like we do.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:26:02.200]   I don't know, but I do know this, he definitely came to appreciate work as a gift of God because
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.400]   he couldn't do it anymore.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.040]   Our culture advertises and markets retirement as the goal.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:17.560]   The world says that retirement is the finish line, it's the goal, no more work.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.360]   Some of us here tonight have adopted that perspective for maybe all the wrong reasons.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:30.080]   We buy the lie of the world that we can live life free from work.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.680]   Retirement is so exalted as a goal in our culture that many labor unions and government
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:42.520]   agencies establish what they call a benefit, a mandatory retirement age.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.980]   No more work.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.720]   So many men buy into this.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.040]   These are the men that live for Friday or live for the weekend, and the empty promise
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.900]   of retirement, and then they cross that finish line, and within days or weeks realize what
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.960]   a gift that work was.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.600]   I know you young guys, it's hard for you to believe that.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:15.280]   A biblical man sees retirement not as a finish line, but as a starting line.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:22.880]   Time where he gets to do new work, different work, service to the family, service in the
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:29.820]   church, the neighborhood, whatever it might be, and of course that work might be slower
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.920]   and less productive because of the ravages of the aging process.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.360]   That is a fact of life too, as we'll see in Ecclesiastes chapter 12.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.880]   There's so many men in this room who I am so grateful for, they model what it's like
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.940]   to cross that finish line and not see it as a finish line, but as a starting point.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:59.720]   They're among us, devoting themselves to the development of the next generation.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.900]   Don't wait to grasp what a gift work is, and let that realization benefit you now while
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.880]   you're working rather than waiting until the point where this truth is when you wished
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   you had understood when it would have benefited you, which is now.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:24.120]   A man who leads at work understands that his work is worship, and he has an entirely different
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.440]   attitude than the rest of the employee force because he understands every day he gets to
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.880]   go to work.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   It's a gift from God.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.680]   Work is also a fact of life.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.200]   It's a fact of life from Genesis 1 and 2, we've seen that work was established way back
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   at the beginning.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:53.120]   I don't know how you could come to any other conclusion than that work is a fact of life.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.700]   It is our lot on this earth.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.340]   It's not optional.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:02.400]   And one of the common deceptions of Satan and the evidences of the pride of man in many
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:08.560]   areas, but particularly in the area of work, is when we believe we have a choice where
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.160]   God has said, "You have no choice."
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.720]   Turning biblical imperatives into options demonstrates either ignorance of God's design
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.800]   or a rebellion and an arrogance against God.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.880]   This is true individually, and it's true of a country.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.720]   Our country right now is being intentionally, or the economy of our country is being intentionally
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.360]   dismantled by the notion that you can opt out of work.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.120]   And the reality today is you can.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.840]   You can live off the government today.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.560]   It's a false option.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.720]   You can live a life of leisure in this country without the demands of work, and this is a
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.240]   choice that's contrary to the immovable force of truth.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.840]   God said, "Work."
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.540]   Sinful man says, "Don't work."
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.960]   It's as stark as that, and how do you think that ends?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.200]   Job 7, 1 says, "Is not man forced to labor on the earth, and are not his days like the
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.580]   days of a hired man?"
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.880]   Some of you are...that's resonating with you right now.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:36.000]   Psalm 104, "The young lions roar after their prey, and they seek their food from God."
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.320]   The lions are fed by God, is what that's saying.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.160]   In verse 22, "When the sun rises, they withdraw, and they lie down in their dens."
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   And guess what?
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.600]   It's our turn.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.280]   Verse 23, "Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.040]   O Lord, how many are your works!
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.200]   In wisdom you have made them all.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.400]   The earth is full of your possessions."
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:06.280]   Whatever your work is, you should embrace it as the gift of God and as a fact of life.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.320]   That might dramatically change how you feel and what you think tomorrow morning when the
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:18.480]   alarm goes off and you put your feet on the floor one more time to head off to work.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   It's a fact of life.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.440]   You're in God's will when you're doing that.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.380]   And it's a gift and it's hard.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.000]   Work is hard.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.400]   Work is not optional and that work's going to be hard.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:40.640]   And this point is not to wow you with some new information, but to put your difficulties
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.620]   at work into context.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.980]   Work is hard for a reason and it's hard for everyone, not just you.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.880]   In Genesis chapter 3 verse 17, again, we keep going back to Genesis because I want you to
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:04.720]   see that this is the design, the perfect design of our creator God in his creative process
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.480]   when he said, "This is good."
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.440]   And then sin entered the world in Genesis chapter 3 and in verse 17 he's pronounced
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.800]   a curse on Satan, he's pronounced a curse on the woman, and now he comes to the man.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.280]   And to Adam he said, "Because you've listened to the voice of your wife and you've eaten
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.600]   from the tree about which I commanded you saying, 'You shall not eat from it, cursed
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.480]   is the ground because of you,' saying, 'You shall not eat from it,' excuse me, 'cursed
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   is the ground because of you, entoil now, you will eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.640]   Both thorns and thistles it will grow for you and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:52.960]   By the sweat of your face you will eat bread till you return to the ground."
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:07.360]   That word toil is izzibon, it means pain, labor, hardship, sorrow, sweat.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.640]   Here's the curse.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:17.440]   Before work was purely a gift and it was a fact of life, but it was not difficult.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:28.200]   The curse is now you aren't going to eat unless you work, and that work is going to be hard.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:35.640]   That word toil is the identical word in verse 16 when the curse is pronounced on Eve, the
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.980]   woman.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   You know this verse.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.920]   He said to the woman, "I will greatly multiply your pain, izzibon."
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.260]   In childbirth, in pain, izzibon, you will bring forth children.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.680]   Now I highly recommend you don't go rushing home.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.640]   Don't be texting your wife right now saying, "I know what labor is like."
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.020]   That won't go over well.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:05.560]   But I do think it's interesting that it's the same word that's used for a woman in labor
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:13.560]   in childbirth that is used to describe the work that we must do now because in the conditions
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.200]   of work because sin entered the world.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.880]   God designed work and now He designed it to be hard.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.040]   And I understand the confusion sometimes.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   Understand this.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.440]   Work is not the curse.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:36.680]   Work existed before the curse, but the nature of our work now is the curse.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:41.600]   Ecclesiastes 2 talks a lot about the futility, frustration, and the fatigue of labor.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.000]   We've covered it.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.680]   Brad covered it really well, but in verse 22 of Ecclesiastes 2, it says, "For what does
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.340]   a man get in all his labor and striving with which he labors under the sun?
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.720]   Because all his days, his task is painful and grievous.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.600]   Even at night, his mind does not rest.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.120]   This too is vanity."
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.660]   I think we all can identify with the words of that verse.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.500]   That is life.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.880]   There's difficult days at work.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:21.160]   Depending on what you do, there's sweat, there's toil, there's sleepless nights, all kinds
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   of difficulties.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.360]   And all of that should be a reminder to us of our fallenness and sin and the holiness
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.680]   of God.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.580]   And if you're saved, it should remind you of the amazing grace of God in saving you
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.180]   in spite of your sin.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:46.160]   So that what Solomon says in Ecclesiastes on his perspective of the difficulty of work
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.040]   can be your perspective.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.320]   What a gift.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.960]   So toils, thorns, thistles, sweat, labor, striving, pain, grief, hardship, have a good
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.680]   day at work tomorrow.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.800]   The next point is that work has a purpose, all of that difficulty.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.840]   Work has a purpose.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.080]   Work brings undeserved blessing and joy to those who will submit to the reality that
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.480]   our creator made us to labor.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.600]   And it's encouraging to remember the purpose of work.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.880]   There is a stark contrast between those who understand the purpose of work and those who
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.760]   do not.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:36.000]   There are those who work hard and diligently through an entire career and they never understand
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.640]   why.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   And in Ecclesiastes chapter 4, there is a description of such a man.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   Verse 7, and by the way, I think this describes a growing demographic in this country.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.320]   Verse 7, I looked again at vanity under the sun.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.480]   Verse 8, there was a certain man without any dependence, having neither a son nor a brother,
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.000]   yet there was no end to all of his labor.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.920]   Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, "For whom am I laboring
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.040]   and depriving myself of pleasure?"
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.320]   This too is vanity and a grievous task.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.120]   This is a portrait of a man who's a hard worker.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.480]   He gets his purpose.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.720]   He works hard.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.000]   He's also financially astute because it says he's wealthy.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.680]   He's saving his money.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.120]   He is taking the results of his work and he is gathering it.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.560]   He's also single.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.680]   He has no family.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.280]   And for whatever reason, he doesn't have his siblings are gone.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.040]   He just has no family.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.360]   That's his life.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.600]   I can't tell you how many young people I talk to in our culture today say that's the ideal.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:08.920]   Wealth, a good job, no children, and yet he never asked, "For whom am I laboring and depriving
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   myself?"
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.200]   And the Bible says that that's grievous.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   Work without purpose is sad.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.520]   It's grievous, it's defeating, and it's vanity.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.440]   So who are you working for?
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.040]   Well we saw in Ephesians 6 and Colossians 3, you're working for who?
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.960]   Christ.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.320]   You're also working to fulfill your God-given purpose on this earth.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.500]   To be in God's will and you're working for family.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:44.600]   You go back to Genesis 1, the work that's described there of multiplying and filling
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.240]   the earth and you're fulfilling God's design and knowing the purpose of work is a grace.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.900]   It's a mercy to know why you work.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:01.080]   And to lead at work, a godly biblical man walks into the workplace knowing why he's
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.160]   there.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.840]   Understanding what work is and understanding what his role is in that workplace and letting
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.320]   that drive his day.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:17.600]   Let me go through a few reasons why we work, and there could be a lot more.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.160]   I'm going to go through these really quickly.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.720]   But one is humility.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   Why do we work?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   What's the purpose of work?
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.040]   Well it keeps us humble.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.040]   It keeps us humble.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.960]   There's an interesting passage in Psalm 107.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.160]   Listen to verse 10 through 12, "There were those who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:40.720]   of death, prisoners in misery and chains, because they had rebelled against the words
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.560]   of God and spurned the counsel of the Most High."
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:52.960]   Verse 12, "Therefore, he humbled their heart with labor."
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.800]   I think the interesting point there is that the psalmist didn't say he punished them with
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   work.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.280]   If you have teenage sons, this might be a good principle to teach them.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.120]   He didn't punish them with work.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.520]   He humbled them with work.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   We need to be humbled.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.880]   Work isn't a source of pride for a Christian.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:20.440]   It's a daily reminder that we serve a good and a gracious God who gifted us with work.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.560]   And without the work he provides, we do not eat.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.400]   And there is a humility in that.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:36.000]   Second, we're commanded to provide for others.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.400]   We're to provide for others.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.920]   1 Timothy 5.8 says, "If anyone," and I'm going through these in a different order than what's
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   on the screen.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.520]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.000]   "If anyone does not provide for his own and especially for those of his household, he
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.280]   has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.720]   You're familiar with that verse.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   Well the way you provide for yourself and for your family is to what?
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   Work.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.920]   That was established in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.600]   That's the connection.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.880]   In Ephesians 4.28 says, "He who steals must steal no longer, but rather he must labor
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:15.560]   performing with his own hands what is good so that he will have something to share with
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.320]   one who has need.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   And the ones with need immediately in front of you are yourself and your family and then
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.680]   it goes from there."
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.760]   Another reason to work is to sleep well.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.880]   Sleep well.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   Pretty practical.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.440]   There's a pretty significant way to know that we're not God.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.400]   We need sleep.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.920]   God doesn't ever sleep.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.800]   It's a reminder every day that God is God and we are not.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.920]   In Ecclesiastes 5.12 says, "The sleep of a working man is pleasant whether he eats little
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:57.520]   or much, but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep."
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.760]   It's better to sleep well than to have wealth that prevents or eliminates the incentive
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.400]   or the need for work.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.580]   Some of us here yearn for wealth and we're completely missing the contentment that comes
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:22.760]   from the simple knowledge in life that where there is a clear connection between working
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.400]   and eating.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.720]   And those of you that are parents need to remember that that connection is important
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.880]   to teach to your children.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:45.660]   We work so that we can be humbled, so that we sleep well, so that we can provide for
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.840]   others and, of course, so that we can eat.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   You're familiar with that.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.900]   And then the last one there is so that we can stay out of trouble.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.740]   And I thought that one might be a hard one to swallow, but someone already talked to
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.740]   me tonight.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.240]   They saw the outline and they said, "I get it.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   That's why I'm working."
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.860]   It's to stay out of trouble.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.860]   It's biblical.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:10.860]   Second Thessalonians 3.10 says, "For even when we were with you, we used to give you
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.860]   this order.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:18.460]   If anyone is not willing to work," there's laziness, "then he is not to eat either.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:22.420]   For we hear that some of you are leading an undisciplined life."
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.860]   There's a second sin, an undisciplined life, doing no work at all but acting like busy
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.940]   bodies.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.500]   That's somebody who has way too much time on their hands.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:37.900]   Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in a quiet fashion
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.300]   and to eat their own bread.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.280]   There is a connection between work and staying out of trouble.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:52.160]   The book I told you about, Men Without Work, either version of those books, devotes several
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:44:00.440]   chapters detailing data and statistics regarding criminal activity, disability statistics,
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.780]   and mortality bearing out the truth of Second Thessalonians 3 in the United States of America
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.920]   right now.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.300]   Laziness and undisciplined life and too much idle time does not end well for a man or for
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.740]   a nation.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.620]   We need to work.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.040]   So leadership is not a title.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.620]   It's defined by character and formed by God's truth and is designed for a man that work
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.620]   is worship.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.460]   It's a fact of life.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.660]   It's a gift from God.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.020]   It's hard and it's purposeful.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:41.600]   And understanding that compels a man to work hard with integrity and grace and to submit
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.820]   to the authorities over him at work.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:54.140]   And if that's you, in an honest assessment of your work life, you are leading at work.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.180]   And to the extent you're showing that at home to your wife and to your children, you are
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:04.260]   leading your family in the area of work.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.760]   So to wrap up, let's just take a minute by looking at what little direct guidance there
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:15.100]   is for those of you who have achieved the title and the responsibility at work where
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:23.020]   others work for you or where they report to you.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.860]   Ephesians 6, 9 comes right at you.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:33.700]   It says, "Masters, do the same things to them and give up threatening, knowing that both
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:38.580]   their master," capital M, who's their master?
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.300]   It's Christ, whether they love Christ or not.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.820]   Both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.900]   That's some pretty profound words there.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.500]   If you're in a position where people report to you, there's really three commands there.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.120]   One is do the same thing to them.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.260]   What does that mean?
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:05.780]   Well, that goes back to verses 5 through 8, those same three commands that we looked at
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.280]   earlier.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:14.700]   You are to be obedient, you are to serve with integrity, and you are to serve with goodwill.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.100]   That didn't change when you were promoted to management.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.140]   That's what that means.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.060]   The command in the first few verses of that passage are that you and I as employees are
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:33.820]   to be obedient, we are to have integrity, and we are to serve with goodwill.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:39.900]   Then the command to those of us, those of you promoted to management is to do the same
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.420]   things to them.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.260]   In other words, you lead by example.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:52.560]   The second command or imperative there is don't forget where you came from.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.860]   Don't forget where you came from.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:02.540]   Being a good servant wasn't an exercise to achieve a position where you could lord it
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.100]   over other people.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.980]   That's the third command, stop threatening.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.900]   You see that?
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   Give up threatening.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:13.940]   There's some direct management consulting.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.380]   Give up threatening.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:22.140]   There's no place for arrogance in leadership.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:30.900]   If you find yourself pulling rank or title to motivate people, you have lost the battle.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.940]   You're to lead by example and by persuasion.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:42.700]   Then in 1 Timothy 6, 1 and 2, there's a word about how others view you as a supervisor.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.300]   All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.120]   This is talking about you now, how people are supposed to view you.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.940]   This is why people like management or they think they do.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.820]   They are to regard you as worthy of all honor so that the name of God in our doctrine will
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:08.820]   not be slandered, but those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.460]   to them because they are brothers, but they must serve them all the more because those
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:20.820]   who partake of the benefits are believers and beloved.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.620]   Teach and exhort these things.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.260]   You look at the commands for those who are under your leadership.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:35.460]   Honor, they are to honor you, they are to respect you, and they are to serve you.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.380]   Who doesn't want to be honored, respected, and served?
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:47.580]   Therein is the enticement to management, and therein is the danger in management for a
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.500]   proud man.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.980]   These are obligations of the employee before the Lord, by the way.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:59.260]   You have no right to make that demand of anybody.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:05.140]   As a manager, you must earn it, and that is the difficulty of leadership.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:11.380]   You're supposed to respect, honor, and serve you, and if you find that nobody does, the
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.780]   problem might be you.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:20.820]   You need to earn it, and here is what engenders trust, respect, and service.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:28.540]   Ephesians 6, 5 through 9, serve with integrity, serve with goodwill.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:35.300]   In Colossians 3, the same thing, integrity, hard work, that is the role of a leader in
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.700]   the workplace.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.820]   Lead by example.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.820]   You work as hard as anyone.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:47.100]   You have an attitude of service and live a life of integrity.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.980]   That is the biblical supervisor and manager.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:57.180]   The result is that your staff might honor, respect, and serve you.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:04.080]   And just to conclude, wherever you are on the org chart at work, remember your title
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.800]   doesn't define your leadership.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.460]   Wherever you are, lead.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:15.860]   Work hard, be excellent with integrity.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:23.100]   Work hard with integrity and grace to the glory of God, your master, capital M, and
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.460]   for the benefit of your employer, small m.
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.140]   And always remember who capital M master is.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.220]   Okay?
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.220]   Let's pray.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.780]   Lord, thank you for your word.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:42.340]   Lord, I pray that your word would do its work in all of our hearts, even now.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:48.140]   And Lord, as we go to talk about these truths, I pray that you would give in these men a
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:55.740]   transparency of vulnerability to talk about an area of life that is sometimes very, very
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.740]   difficult.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.180]   I pray that you would encourage the hearts of these men.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:05.180]   Lord, may we go from here, hundreds of men, into the workplace in Southern California
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:11.340]   and be different, increasingly different, just simply by remembering the truths that
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:19.500]   you've designed work, that it's for our good, that it should be a joy, that it's a gift
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.780]   from you, and that our work truly is worship, and that we work for you.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:30.540]   Lord, may that be impactful in our workplaces for the advancement of your kingdom and for
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   your glory.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.700]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:42.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
